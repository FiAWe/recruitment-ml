the suburb of saffron park lay on the sunset side of london as red and ragged as a cloud of sunset it was built of a bright brick throughout its sky-line was fantastic and even its ground plan was wild it had been the outburst of a speculative builder faintly tinged with art who called its architecture sometimes elizabethan and sometimes queen anne apparently under the impression that the two sovereigns were identical it was described with some justice as an artistic colony though it never in any definable way produced any art but although its pretensions to be an intellectual centre were a little vague its pretensions to be a pleasant place were quite indisputable the stranger who looked for the first time at the quaint red houses could only think how very oddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them nor when he met the people was he disappointed in this respect the place was not only pleasant but perfect if once he could regard it not as a deception but rather as a dream even if the people were not artists the whole was nevertheless artistic that young man with the long auburn hair and the impudent face -- that young man was not really a poet but surely he was a poem that old gentleman with the wild white beard and the wild white hat -- that venerable humbug was not really a philosopher but at least he was the cause of philosophy in others that scientific gentleman with the bald egg-like head and the bare bird-like neck had no real right to the airs of science that he assumed he had not discovered anything new in biology but what biological creature could he have discovered more singular than himself thus and thus only the whole place had properly to be regarded it had to be considered not so much as a workshop for artists but as a frail but finished work of art a man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had stepped into a written comedy,0,0,7.223709e-09

the voice was too polite for good manners it was incongruous with the eccentric spectacle of the duellists which ought to have startled a sane and free man it was also incongruous with the full and healthy though rather loose physique of the man who spoke at the first glance he looked a fine animal with curling gold beard and hair and blue eyes unusually bright it was only at the second glance that the mind felt a sudden and perhaps unmeaning irritation at the way in which the gold beard retreated backwards into the waistcoat and the way in which the finely shaped nose went forward as if smelling its way and it was only perhaps at the hundredth glance that the bright blue eyes which normally before and after the instant seemed brilliant with intelligence seemed as it were to be brilliant with idiocy he was a heavy healthy-looking man who looked all the larger because of the loose light coloured clothes that he wore and that had in their extreme lightness and looseness almost a touch of the tropics but a closer examination of his attire would have shown that even in the tropics it would have been unique but it was all woven according to some hygienic texture which no human being had ever heard of before and which was absolutely necessary even for a day's health he wore a huge broad-brimmed hat equally hygienic very much at the back of his head and his voice coming out of so heavy and hearty a type of man was as i have said startlingly shrill and deferential,0,0,2.5292297e-09

the major was still looking at him quietly but with protruding eyes when the front door was flung open releasing a flood of gaslight on the face of the fading mist and another figure in pyjamas sprang or tumbled out into the garden the figure was much longer leaner and more athletic the pyjamas though equally tropical were comparatively tasteful being of white with a light lemon-yellow stripe the man was haggard but handsome more sunburned than the other he had an aquiline profile and rather deep-sunken eyes and a slight air of oddity arising from the combination of coal-black hair with a much lighter moustache all this father brown absorbed in detail more at leisure for the moment he only saw one thing about the man which was the revolver in his hand,0,0,2.6066294e-10

those who happen to hold the view and mr evan macian now alive and comfortable is among the number that something supernatural some eccentric kindness from god or fairy had guided our adventurers through all their absurd perils might have found his strongest argument perhaps in their management or mismanagement of mr wilkinson's yacht neither of them had the smallest qualification for managing such a vessel but macian had a practical knowledge of the sea in much smaller and quite different boats while turnbull had an abstract knowledge of science and some of its applications to navigation which was worse the presence of the god or fairy can only be deduced from the fact that they never definitely ran into anything either a boat a rock a quicksand or a man-of-war apart from this negative description their voyage would be difficult to describe it took at least a fortnight and macian who was certainly the shrewder sailor of the two realized that they were sailing west into the atlantic and were probably by this time past the scilly isles how much farther they stood out into the western sea it was impossible to conjecture but they felt certain at least that they were far enough into that awful gulf between us and america to make it unlikely that they would soon see land again it was therefore with legitimate excitement that one rainy morning after daybreak they saw that distinct shape of a solitary island standing up against the encircling strip of silver which ran round the skyline and separated the grey and green of the billows from the grey and mauve of the morning clouds,0,0,1.1379407e-09

madeleine durand was physically a sleepy young woman and might easily have been supposed to be morally a lazy one it is however certain that the work of her house was done somehow and it is even more rapidly ascertainable that nobody else did it the logician is therefore driven back upon the assumption that she did it and that lends a sort of mysterious interest to her personality at the beginning she had very broad low and level brows which seemed even lower because her warm yellow hair clustered down to her eyebrows and she had a face just plump enough not to look as powerful as it was anything that was heavy in all this was abruptly lightened by two large light china-blue eyes lightened all of a sudden as if it had been lifted into the air by two big blue butterflies the rest of her was less than middle-sized and was of a casual and comfortable sort and she had this difference from such girls as the girl in the motor-car that one did not incline to take in her figure at all but only her broad and leonine and innocent head,0,0,5.5489163e-10

mrs dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him for his coming to barton was in her opinion of all things the most natural her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder he received the kindest welcome from her and shyness coldness reserve could not stand against such a reception they had begun to fail him before he entered the house and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of mrs dashwood indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters without extending the passion to her and elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself his affections seemed to reanimate towards them all and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible he was not in spirits however he praised their house admired its prospect was attentive and kind but still he was not in spirits the whole family perceived it and mrs dashwood attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents,1,1,1.0

i come now to the relation of a misfortune which about this time befell mrs john dashwood it so happened that while her two sisters with mrs jennings were first calling on her in harley street another of her acquaintance had dropt in -- a circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her but while the imaginations of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct and to decide on it by slight appearances one's happiness must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance in the present instance this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability that on merely hearing the name of the miss dashwoods and understanding them to be mr dashwood's sisters she immediately concluded them to be staying in harley street and this misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards cards of invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister to a small musical party at her house the consequence of which was that mrs john dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the miss dashwoods but what was still worse must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing to treat them with attention and who could tell that they might not expect to go out with her a second time the power of disappointing them it was true must always be her's but that was not enough for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from them,1,1,0.9999999

in one respect perhaps mr elton's manners are superior to mr knightley's or mr weston's they have more gentleness they might be more safely held up as a pattern there is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body likes in him because there is so much good-humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied neither would mr knightley's downright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits him very well his figure and look and situation in life seem to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him he would not be sufferable on the contrary i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr elton as a model mr elton is good-humoured cheerful obliging and gentle he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be if he means any thing it must be to please you did not i tell you what he said of you the other day,1,1,1.0

the incident of the religious fanatic who broke a window on ludgate hill was alone enough to set them up in good copy for the night but when the same man was brought before a magistrate and defied his enemy to mortal combat in the open court then the columns would hardly hold the excruciating information and the headlines were so large that there was hardly room for any of the text the daily telegraph headed a column a duel on divinity and there was a correspondence afterwards which lasted for months about whether police magistrates ought to mention religion the daily mail in its dull sensible way headed the events wanted to fight for the virgin mr james douglas in the star presuming on his knowledge of philosophical and theological terms described the christian's outbreak under the title of dualist and duellist the daily news inserted a colourless account of the matter but was pursued and eaten up for some weeks with letters from outlying ministers headed murder and mariolatry but the journalistic temperature was steadily and consistently heated by all these influences the journalists had tasted blood prospectively and were in the mood for more everything in the matter prepared them for further outbursts of moral indignation and when a gasping reporter rushed in in the last hours of the evening with the announcement that the two heroes of the police court had literally been found fighting in a london back garden with a shopkeeper bound and gagged in the front of the house the editors and sub-editors were stricken still as men are by great beatitudes,0,0,5.28124e-09

there was no reason to suppose mr elton thought at all differently from his wife he seemed not merely happy with her but proud he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury as not even miss woodhouse could equal and the greater part of her new acquaintance disposed to commend or not in the habit of judging following the lead of miss bates's good-will or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself were very well satisfied so that mrs elton's praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do unimpeded by miss woodhouse who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being very pleasant and very elegantly dressed,1,1,1.0

escape however was not his plan he came to the part of the room where the sitters-by were collected spoke to some and walked about in front of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution of maintaining it he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith or speaking to those who were close to her -- emma saw it she was not yet dancing she was working her way up from the bottom and had therefore leisure to look around and by only turning her head a little she saw it all when she was half-way up the set the whole group were exactly behind her and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch but mr elton was so near that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and mrs weston and she perceived that his wife who was standing immediately above her was not only listening also but even encouraging him by significant glances -- the kind-hearted gentle mrs weston had left her seat to join him and say do not you dance mr elton to which his prompt reply was most readily mrs weston if you will dance with me,1,1,1.0

it was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any considerable absence without feeling that she had injured her and now when the due visit was paid on her arrival after a two years' interval she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating jane fairfax was very elegant remarkably elegant and she had herself the highest value for elegance her height was pretty just such as almost every body would think tall and nobody could think very tall her figure particularly graceful her size a most becoming medium between fat and thin though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two emma could not but feel all this and then her face -- her features -- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered it was not regular but it was very pleasing beauty her eyes a deep grey with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows had never been denied their praise but the skin which she had been used to cavil at as wanting colour had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom it was a style of beauty of which elegance was the reigning character and as such she must in honour by all her principles admire it -- elegance which whether of person or of mind she saw so little in highbury there not to be vulgar was distinction and merit,1,1,1.0

elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater had the colonel been really making her an offer of his hand the preferment which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for edward was already provided to enable him to marry -- and she of all people in the world was fixed on to bestow it -- her emotion was such as mrs jennings had attributed to a very different cause -- but whatever minor feelings less pure less pleasing might have a share in that emotion her esteem for the general benevolence and her gratitude for the particular friendship which together prompted colonel brandon to this act were strongly felt and warmly expressed she thanked him for it with all her heart spoke of edward's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another but at the same time she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself it was an office in short from which unwilling to give edward the pain of receiving an obligation from her she would have been very glad to be spared herself -- but colonel brandon on motives of equal delicacy declining it likewise still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means that she would not on any account make farther opposition edward she believed was still in town and fortunately she had heard his address from miss steele she could undertake therefore to inform him of it in the course of the day after this had been settled colonel brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour and then it was that he mentioned with regret that the house was small and indifferent -- an evil which elinor as mrs jennings had supposed her to do made very light of at least as far as regarded its size,1,1,1.0

that is exactly what i said my dear 'lord ' says i 'is mrs dashwood ill ' so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this mr edward ferrars the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy -- there's for you my dear -- and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except nancy -- could you have believed such a thing possible -- there is no great wonder in their liking one another but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it -- that is strange -- i never happened to see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly well and so this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter -- till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a well-meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out 'lord ' thinks she to herself 'they are all so fond of lucy to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ' and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to make a match between edward and some lord's daughter or other i forget who so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as reached your brother's ears as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on poor soul i pity her and i must say i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do mrs dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes then she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan and mr donavan found the house in all this uproar the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came off poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her lord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it to have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion -- and mr donavan thinks just the same he and i had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too and so she may for what i care i have no pity for either of them i have no notion of people's making such a to-do about money and greatness there is no reason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry for i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well by her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight lord how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids and two men and i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my betty has a sister out of place that would fit them exactly,1,1,0.99999905

while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room and by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others it fell to anne's lot to be placed rather apart with captain benwick and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him he was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect and anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading though principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening's indulgence in the discussion of subjects which his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out of their conversation for though shy he did not seem reserved it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets trying to ascertain whether marmion or the lady of the lake were to be preferred and how ranked the giaour and the bride of abydos and moreover how the giaour was to be pronounced he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines which imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry and to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly,1,1,1.0

mr dashwood's strains were more solemn mrs ferrars was the most unfortunate of women -- poor fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility -- and he considered the existence of each under such a blow with grateful wonder robert's offence was unpardonable but lucy's was infinitely worse neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to mrs ferrars and even if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter nor be permitted to appear in her presence the secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime because had any suspicion of it occurred to the others proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage and he called on elinor to join with him in regretting that lucy's engagement with edward had not rather been fulfilled than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family -- he thus continued,1,1,1.0

elinor this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possessed a strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which qualified her though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother and enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them all that eagerness of mind in mrs dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence she had an excellent heart -- her disposition was affectionate and her feelings were strong but she knew how to govern them it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught,1,1,1.0

when their promised visit to the park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place they found in the appearance of the eldest who was nearly thirty with a very plain and not a sensible face nothing to admire but in the other who was not more than two or three and twenty they acknowledged considerable beauty her features were pretty and she had a sharp quick eye and a smartness of air which though it did not give actual elegance or grace gave distinction to her person -- their manners were particularly civil and elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to lady middleton with her children they were in continual raptures extolling their beauty courting their notice and humouring their whims and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing if she happened to be doing any thing or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles a fond mother though in pursuit of praise for her children the most rapacious of human beings is likewise the most credulous her demands are exorbitant but she will swallow any thing and the excessive affection and endurance of the miss steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by lady middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust she saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted she saw their sashes untied their hair pulled about their ears their work-bags searched and their knives and scissors stolen away and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment it suggested no other surprise than that elinor and marianne should sit so composedly by without claiming a share in what was passing,1,1,1.0

mrs weston's friends were all made happy by her safety and if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to emma it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her hereafter with either of isabella's sons but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best it would be a great comfort to mr weston as he grew older -- and even mr weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home and mrs weston -- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have their powers in exercise again,1,1,1.0

if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender recollection there is a very strong resemblance between them as well in mind as person the same warmth of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits this lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends i cannot remember the time when i did not love eliza and my affection for her as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me incapable of having ever felt her's for me was i believe fervent as the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby and it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate at seventeen she was lost to me for ever she was married -- married against her inclination to my brother her fortune was large and our family estate much encumbered and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty and for some time it did but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though she had promised me that nothing -- but how blindly i relate i have never told you how this was brought on we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland the treachery or the folly of my cousin's maid betrayed us i was banished to the house of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father's point was gained i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one -- but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have now to lament it this however was not the case my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been and from the first he treated her unkindly the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as mrs brandon's was but too natural she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my father lived only a few months after their marriage and i was with my regiment in the east indies she should fall had i remained in england perhaps -- but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange the shock which her marriage had given me he continued in a voice of great agitation was of trifling weight -- was nothing to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce it was that which threw this gloom -- even now the recollection of what i suffered --,1,1,1.0

mrs dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite she rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt -- she was sorry for him -- she wished him happy but the feelings of the past could not be recalled -- nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken -- a character unblemished to marianne nothing could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his means nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards eliza nothing could replace him therefore in her former esteem nor injure the interests of colonel brandon,1,1,1.0

colonel brandon's delicate unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to miss dashwood he had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her sister's disappointment by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it and they always conversed with confidence his chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations was given in the pitying eye with which marianne sometimes observed him and the gentleness of her voice whenever though it did not often happen she was obliged or could oblige herself to speak to him these assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself and these gave elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter but mrs jennings who knew nothing of all this who knew only that the colonel continued as grave as ever and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself nor commission her to make it for him began at the end of two days to think that instead of midsummer they would not be married till michaelmas and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all the good understanding between the colonel and miss dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry-tree the canal and the yew arbour would all be made over to her and mrs jennings had for some time ceased to think at all of mrs ferrars,1,1,1.0

father brown was in no mood for adventures he had lately fallen ill with over-work and when he began to recover his friend flambeau had taken him on a cruise in a small yacht with sir cecil fanshaw a young cornish squire and an enthusiast for cornish coast scenery but brown was still rather weak he was no very happy sailor and though he was never of the sort that either grumbles or breaks down his spirits did not rise above patience and civility when the other two men praised the ragged violet sunset or the ragged volcanic crags he agreed with them when flambeau pointed out a rock shaped like a dragon he looked at it and thought it very like a dragon when fanshaw more excitedly indicated a rock that was like merlin he looked at it and signified assent when flambeau asked whether this rocky gate of the twisted river was not the gate of fairyland he said yes he heard the most important things and the most trivial with the same tasteless absorption he heard that the coast was death to all but careful seamen he also heard that the ship's cat was asleep he heard that fanshaw couldn't find his cigar-holder anywhere he also heard the pilot deliver the oracle both eyes bright she's all right one eye winks down she sinks he heard flambeau say to fanshaw that no doubt this meant the pilot must keep both eyes open and be spry and he heard fanshaw say to flambeau that oddly enough it didn't mean this it meant that while they saw two of the coast lights one near and the other distant exactly side by side they were in the right river-channel but that if one light was hidden behind the other they were going on the rocks he heard fanshaw add that his country was full of such quaint fables and idioms it was the very home of romance he even pitted this part of cornwall against devonshire as a claimant to the laurels of elizabethan seamanship according to him there had been captains among these coves and islets compared with whom drake was practically a landsman he heard flambeau laugh and ask if perhaps the adventurous title of westward ho only meant that all devonshire men wished they were living in cornwall he heard fanshaw say there was no need to be silly that not only had cornish captains been heroes but that they were heroes still that near that very spot there was an old admiral now retired who was scarred by thrilling voyages full of adventures and who had in his youth found the last group of eight pacific islands that was added to the chart of the world this cecil fanshaw was in person of the kind that commonly urges such crude but pleasing enthusiasms a very young man light-haired high-coloured with an eager profile with a boyish bravado of spirits but an almost girlish delicacy of tint and type the big shoulders black brows and black mousquetaire swagger of flambeau were a great contrast,0,0,5.113871e-10

sir walter had once been in company with the late viscount but had never seen any of the rest of the family and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter's at the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland the neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner for when poor lady elliot died herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynch and consequently there was but too much reason to apprehend that the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed how to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted as cousins again was the question and it was a question which in a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliot thought unimportant family connexions were always worth preserving good company always worth seeking lady dalrymple had taken a house for three months in laura place and would be living in style she had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman it was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any compromise of propriety on the side of the elliots,1,1,1.0

mr john knightley was a tall gentleman-like and very clever man rising in his profession domestic and respectable in his private character but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing and capable of being sometimes out of humour he was not an ill-tempered man not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach but his temper was not his great perfection and indeed with such a worshipping wife it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted and he could sometimes act an ungracious or say a severe thing,1,1,1.0
contrary to the usual course of things mr elton's wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion his professions and his proposals did him no service she thought nothing of his attachment and was insulted by his hopes he wanted to marry well and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her pretended to be in love but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for there had been no real affection either in his language or manners sighs and fine words had been given in abundance but she could hardly devise any set of expressions or fancy any tone of voice less allied with real love she need not trouble herself to pity him he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself and if miss woodhouse of hartfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for miss somebody else with twenty or with ten,1,1,1.0

the subject followed it was in plain unaffected gentlemanlike english such as mr knightley used even to the woman he was in love with how to be able to ask her to marry him without attacking the happiness of her father emma's answer was ready at the first word while her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible for her she could never quit him part only of this answer however was admitted the impossibility of her quitting her father mr knightley felt as strongly as herself but the inadmissibility of any other change he could not agree to he had been thinking it over most deeply most intently he had at first hoped to induce mr woodhouse to remove with her to donwell he had wanted to believe it feasible but his knowledge of mr woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long and now he confessed his persuasion that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father's comfort perhaps even of his life which must not be hazarded mr woodhouse taken from hartfield -- no he felt that it ought not to be attempted but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this he trusted his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable it was that he should be received at hartfield that so long as her father's happiness in other words his life -- required hartfield to continue her home it should be his likewise,1,1,1.0
of what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified he persisted in having loved none but her she had never been supplanted he never even believed himself to see her equal thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge that he had been constant unconsciously nay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it to be done he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only been angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been a sufferer from them her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross had he learnt to do her justice and only at lyme had he begun to understand himself at lyme he had received lessons of more than one sort the passing admiration of mr elliot had at least roused him and the scenes on the cobb and at captain harville's had fixed her superiority,1,1,1.0

as modern newspapers are conducted the most honest and most important news is the police news if it be true that in the twentieth century more space is given to murder than to politics it is for the excellent reason that murder is a more serious subject but even this would hardly explain the enormous omnipresence and widely distributed detail of the bruno case or the passage mystery in the press of london and the provinces so vast was the excitement that for some weeks the press really told the truth and the reports of examination and cross-examination if interminable even if intolerable are at least reliable the true reason of course was the coincidence of persons the victim was a popular actress the accused was a popular actor and the accused had been caught red-handed as it were by the most popular soldier of the patriotic season in those extraordinary circumstances the press was paralysed into probity and accuracy and the rest of this somewhat singular business can practically be recorded from reports of bruno's trial,0,0,2.2379575e-10

he momentarily fulfilled all fanshaw's fable of an old piratical admiral though the details seemed afterwards to decompose into accidents for instance he wore a broad-brimmed hat as protection against the sun but the front flap of it was turned up straight to the sky and the two corners pulled down lower than the ears so that it stood across his forehead in a crescent like the old cocked hat worn by nelson he wore an ordinary dark-blue jacket with nothing special about the buttons but the combination of it with white linen trousers somehow had a sailorish look he was tall and loose and walked with a sort of swagger which was not a sailor's roll and yet somehow suggested it and he held in his hand a short sabre which was like a navy cutlass but about twice as big under the bridge of the hat his eagle face looked eager all the more because it was not only clean-shaven but without eyebrows it seemed almost as if all the hair had come off his face from his thrusting it through a throng of elements his eyes were prominent and piercing his colour was curiously attractive while partly tropical it reminded one vaguely of a blood-orange that is that while it was ruddy and sanguine there was a yellow in it that was in no way sickly but seemed rather to glow like gold apples of the hesperides -- father brown thought he had never seen a figure so expressive of all the romances about the countries of the sun,0,0,6.9664785e-09

yes -- i have some right to that knowledge though i have never been at the place in my life -- she is an odd woman -- but i never allow myself to speak ill of her on frank's account for i do believe her to be very fond of him i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been kind to him in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing to be as she likes and it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection for though i would not say it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper,1,1,0.9999821
