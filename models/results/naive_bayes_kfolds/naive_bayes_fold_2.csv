the real evils indeed of emma's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments the danger however was at present so unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her,1,1,0.9503384371085569
highbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town to which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies and name did really belong afforded her no equals the woodhouses were first in consequence there all looked up to them she had many acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day it was a melancholy change and emma could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful his spirits required support he was a nervous man easily depressed fond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them hating change of every kind matrimony as the origin of change was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying nor could ever speak of her but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,1,1,0.9978681401343465

emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own the backgammon-table was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary,1,1,0.9604187326087812

emma knows i never flatter her said mr knightley but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be a gainer,1,1,0.9786802819731526
i do not understand what you mean by success ' said mr knightley success supposes endeavour your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young lady's mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr weston were to marry her ' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where is your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess and that is all that can be said,1,1,0.9669034043741994
miss churchill however being of age and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it took place to the infinite mortification of mr and mrs churchill who threw her off with due decorum it was an unsuitable connexion and did not produce much happiness mrs weston ought to have found more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit she had not the best she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger nor from missing the luxuries of her former home they lived beyond their income but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe,1,1,0.9959533629342273
now upon his father's marriage it was very generally proposed as a most proper attention that the visit should take place there was not a dissentient voice on the subject either when mrs perry drank tea with mrs and miss bates or when mrs and miss bates returned the visit now was the time for mr frank churchill to come among them and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion for a few days every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs weston had received i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr frank churchill has written to mrs weston i understand it was a very handsome letter indeed mr woodhouse told me of it mr woodhouse saw the letter and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life,1,1,0.9994284768814681
her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to mrs weston and of moments only of regret and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment was so just and so apparent that emma well as she knew her father was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity poor miss taylor ' when they left her at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own but never did she go without mr woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh and saying ah poor miss taylor she would be very glad to stay,1,1,0.999354897119943
there was no recovering miss taylor -- nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mr woodhouse the compliments of his neighbours were over he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event and the wedding-cake which had been a great distress to him was all eat up his own stomach could bear nothing rich and he could never believe other people to be different from himself what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it he had been at the pains of consulting mr perry the apothecary on the subject mr perry was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of mr woodhouse's life and upon being applied to he could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many -- perhaps with most people unless taken moderately with such an opinion in confirmation of his own mr woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone,1,1,0.9944247559598345
there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs weston's wedding-cake in their hands but mr woodhouse would never believe it,1,1,0.9493397876824108
mrs bates the widow of a former vicar of highbury was a very old lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille she lived with her single daughter in a very small way and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady under such untoward circumstances can excite her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young handsome rich nor married miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness her youth had passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible and yet she was a happy woman and a woman whom no one named without good-will it was her own universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders she loved every body was interested in every body's happiness quicksighted to every body's merits thought herself a most fortunate creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother and so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted for nothing the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature her contented and grateful spirit were a recommendation to every body and a mine of felicity to herself she was a great talker upon little matters which exactly suited mr woodhouse full of trivial communications and harmless gossip,1,1,0.9934811559688634
mrs goddard was the mistress of a school -- not of a seminary or an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality upon new principles and new systems -- and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity -- but a real honest old-fashioned boarding-school where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price and where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble themselves into a little education without any danger of coming back prodigies mrs goddard's school was in high repute -- and very deservedly for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty of wholesome food let them run about a great deal in the summer and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church she was a plain motherly kind of woman who had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit and having formerly owed much to mr woodhouse's kindness felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour hung round with fancy-work whenever she could and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside,1,1,0.9200447137024917
these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect and happy was she for her father's sake in the power though as far as she was herself concerned it was no remedy for the absence of mrs weston she was delighted to see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated,1,1,0.9923163747272137
she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith's conversation but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement encouragement should be given those soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her the friends from whom she had just parted though very good sort of people must be doing her harm they were a family of the name of martin whom emma well knew by character as renting a large farm of mr knightley and residing in the parish of donwell -- very creditably she believed -- she knew mr knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect she would notice her she would improve her she would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her into good society she would form her opinions and her manners it would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking highly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers,1,1,0.9989813321690342
she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and listening and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the supper-table which always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas did she then do all the honours of the meal and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests,1,1,0.8547390482368353
mrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome serle understands boiling an egg better than any body i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you miss bates let emma help you to a little bit of tart -- a very little bit ours are all apple-tarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here i do not advise the custard mrs goddard what say you to half a glass of wine a small half-glass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you,1,1,0.5351880542591017
mr martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business he does not read,1,1,0.811783646259152
oh not handsome -- not at all handsome i thought him very plain at first but i do not think him so plain now one does not you know after a time but did you never see him he is in highbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston he has passed you very often,1,1,0.8389945763390249
i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does marry -- i mean as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman's daughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you,1,1,0.9217707440317775
only think of our happening to meet him -- how very odd it was quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls he did not think we ever walked this road he thought we walked towards randalls most days he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again to-morrow so very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected what do you think of him do you think him so very plain,1,1,0.8070121440497584
i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men i should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before do not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here,1,1,0.9761122446401039
how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else -- which is just as it should be for a thriving man what has he to do with books and i have no doubt that he will thrive and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us,1,1,0.7378096047043499
she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from mr elton and now did full justice to and harriet blushed and smiled and said she had always thought mr elton very agreeable,1,1,0.9847288316704443
mr elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harriet's head she thought it would be an excellent match and only too palpably desirable natural and probable for her to have much merit in planning it she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict it was not likely however that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harriet's coming to hartfield the longer she considered it the greater was her sense of its expediency mr elton's situation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself and without low connexions at the same time not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet he had a comfortable home for her and emma imagined a very sufficient income for though the vicarage of highbury was not large he was known to have some independent property and she thought very highly of him as a good-humoured well-meaning respectable young man without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world,1,1,0.9990021906046525
why to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne we will not despair however weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him,1,1,0.7199960144503486
i either depend more upon emma's good sense than you do or am more anxious for her present comfort for i cannot lament the acquaintance how well she looked last night,1,1,0.9495868649607635
i do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers but i am a partial old friend,1,1,0.6522395854035823
i have no doubt of it and it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation which had a vast deal of the lover she was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers to have harriet's picture,1,1,0.8526172513138113
what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be i would give any money for it i almost long to attempt her likeness myself you do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general but from one cause or another i gave it up in disgust but really i could almost venture if harriet would sit to me it would be such a delight to have her picture,1,1,0.9228600471482256
yes good man -- thought emma -- but what has all that to do with taking likenesses you know nothing of drawing don't pretend to be in raptures about mine keep your raptures for harriet's face well if you give me such kind encouragement mr elton i believe i shall try what i can do harriet's features are very delicate which makes a likeness difficult and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch,1,1,0.8042785667219835
you have made her too tall emma said mr knightley,1,1,0.9577131899460186
oh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall consider she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved you know proportions fore-shortening -- oh no it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith's exactly so indeed,1,1,0.7466718342615484
it is very pretty said mr woodhouse so prettily done just as your drawings always are my dear i do not know any body who draws so well as you do the only thing i do not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold,1,1,0.8049836439050093
this man is almost too gallant to be in love thought emma i should say so but that i suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love he is an excellent young man and will suit harriet exactly it will be an exactly so ' as he says himself but he does sigh and languish and study for compliments rather more than i could endure as a principal i come in for a pretty good share as a second but it is his gratitude on harriet's account,1,1,0.9544570689704148
the very day of mr elton's going to london produced a fresh occasion for emma's services towards her friend harriet had been at hartfield as usual soon after breakfast and after a time had gone home to return again to dinner she returned and sooner than had been talked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell half a minute brought it all out she had heard as soon as she got back to mrs goddard's that mr martin had been there an hour before and finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away and on opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy a letter to herself and this letter was from him from mr martin and contained a direct proposal of marriage who could have thought it she was so surprized she did not know what to do yes quite a proposal of marriage and a very good letter at least she thought so and he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she should do -- emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful,1,1,0.9974193475648229
what shall you do in what respect do you mean with regard to this letter,1,1,0.591846101425587
no i do not that is i do not mean -- what shall i do what would you advise me to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i ought to do,1,1,0.7308347085702372
emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer and advised its being written directly which was agreed to in the hope of her assistance and though emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence the looking over his letter again in replying to it had such a softening tendency that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment he would have been accepted after all,1,1,0.9916737957440842
let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed cried emma at this moment perhaps mr elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name,1,1,0.8142397053127877
harriet slept at hartfield that night for some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself and emma judged it best in every respect safest and kindest to keep her with them as much as possible just at present she was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs goddard's but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield to make a regular visit of some days,1,1,0.9917602420563103
while she was gone mr knightley called and sat some time with mr woodhouse and emma till mr woodhouse who had previously made up his mind to walk out was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it and was induced by the entreaties of both though against the scruples of his own civility to leave mr knightley for that purpose mr knightley who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering by his short decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other,1,1,0.9892395987360225
pray mr knightley said emma who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech how do you know that mr martin did not speak yesterday,1,1,0.9649695062564277
not harriet's equal exclaimed mr knightley loudly and warmly and with calmer asperity added a few moments afterwards no he is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you what are harriet smith's claims either of birth nature or education to any connexion higher than robert martin she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and certainly no respectable relations she is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school she is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any information she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself at her age she can have no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her she is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all my only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him i felt that as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse but i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck even your satisfaction i made sure of it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's leaving highbury for the sake of her being settled so well i remember saying to myself even emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a good match ',1,1,0.997673338142883
i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing what think a farmer and with all his sense and all his merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings i assure you mine are very different i must think your statement by no means fair you are not just to harriet's claims they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society -- the sphere in which she moves is much above his -- it would be a degradation,1,1,0.9933686183759284
whoever might be her parents said mr knightley whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs goddard's hands to shift as she can -- to move in short in mrs goddard's line to have mrs goddard's acquaintance her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was good enough she desired nothing better herself till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer she had no sense of superiority then if she has it now you have given it you have been no friend to harriet smith emma robert martin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him i know him well he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any man i know depend upon it he had encouragement,1,1,0.9962356233295914
it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again,1,1,0.905942802816199
he had frightened her a little about mr elton but when she considered that mr knightley could not have observed him as she had done neither with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself in spite of mr knightley's pretensions with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself that he had spoken it hastily and in anger she was able to believe that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true than what he knew any thing about he certainly might have heard mr elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done and mr elton might not be of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to money matters he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them but then mr knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives mr knightley saw no such passion and of course thought nothing of its effects but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest and more than a reasonable becoming degree of prudence she was very sure did not belong to mr elton,1,1,0.9948965407649352
harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers she came back not to think of mr martin but to talk of mr elton miss nash had been telling her something which she repeated immediately with great delight mr perry had been to mrs goddard's to attend a sick child and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park he had met mr elton and found to his great surprize that mr elton was actually on his road to london and not meaning to return till the morrow though it was the whist-club night which he had been never known to miss before and mr perry had remonstrated with him about it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player to absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day but it would not do mr elton had been determined to go on and had said in a very particular way indeed that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world and something about a very enviable commission and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious mr perry could not quite understand him but he was very sure there must be a lady in the case and he told him so and mr elton only looked very conscious and smiling and rode off in great spirits miss nash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more about mr elton and said looking so very significantly at her that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be but she only knew that any woman whom mr elton could prefer she should think the luckiest woman in the world for beyond a doubt mr elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness,1,1,0.9974946041067941
the picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after mr elton's return and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room he got up to look at it and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought and as for harriet's feelings they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted emma was soon perfectly satisfied of mr martin's being no otherwise remembered than as he furnished a contrast with mr elton of the utmost advantage to the latter,1,1,0.9811315390246222
mr woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them but he hoped he should in time and it always ended in kitty a fair but frozen maid,1,1,0.9365274788998122
the speech was more to emma than to harriet which emma could understand there was deep consciousness about him and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend's he was gone the next moment -- after another moment's pause,1,1,0.9290641559066418
what can it be miss woodhouse -- what can it be i have not an idea -- i cannot guess it in the least what can it possibly be do try to find it out miss woodhouse do help me i never saw any thing so hard is it kingdom i wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady do you think it is a good one can it be woman,1,1,0.8866602991085982
mermaids and sharks nonsense my dear harriet what are you thinking of where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark give me the paper and listen,1,1,0.7441582740684684

i do not know my dear i am sure i was very much surprized when i first heard she was going to be married,1,1,0.9384588764900653
but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon though he does i think emma i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us she and the children might stay very well,1,1,0.9530001508240973
ah papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish and i do not think you ever will isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband,1,1,0.9185354784181717
i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not,1,1,0.6050919151309686
later in the morning and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again harriet turned away but emma could receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up his ostensible reason however was to ask whether mr woodhouse's party could be made up in the evening without him or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield if he were every thing else must give way but otherwise his friend cole had been saying so much about his dining with him -- had made such a point of it that he had promised him conditionally to come,1,1,0.9844605578744144
mr elton certainly did not very well know what to say he looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused said something about honour -- glanced at emma and at harriet and then seeing the book open on the table took it up and examined it very attentively with the view of passing off an awkward moment emma smilingly said,1,1,0.8705208402412782
my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry i must find other people charming -- one other person at least and i am not only not going to be married at present but have very little intention of ever marrying at all,1,1,0.9697623526713773
i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet to be tempted mr elton you know recollecting herself is out of the question and i do not wish to see any such person i would rather not be tempted i cannot really change for the better if i were to marry i must expect to repent it,1,1,0.9490693044447026
but still you will be an old maid and that's so dreadful,1,0,0.46545895085168326
if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great many independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation if i draw less i shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpet-work and as for objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying i shall be very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much to care about there will be enough of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need there will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder my nephews and nieces -- i shall often have a niece with me,1,1,0.9305259000314096
anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised on one side of the lane leaving them together in the main road but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriet's habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too and that in short they would both be soon after her this would not do she immediately stopped under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half-boot and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on and she would follow in half a minute they did as they were desired and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot she had the comfort of farther delay in her power being overtaken by a child from the cottage setting out according to orders with her pitcher to fetch broth from hartfield to walk by the side of this child and talk to and question her was the most natural thing in the world or would have been the most natural had she been acting just then without design and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead without any obligation of waiting for her she gained on them however involuntarily the child's pace was quick and theirs rather slow and she was the more concerned at it from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them mr elton was speaking with animation harriet listening with a very pleased attention and emma having sent the child on was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more when they both looked around and she was obliged to join them,1,1,0.9840528733807252
part of my lace is gone said she and i do not know how i am to contrive i really am a most troublesome companion to you both but i hope i am not often so ill-equipped mr elton i must beg leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on,1,1,0.7751043354834253
he was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law nothing wrong in him escaped her she was quick in feeling the little injuries to isabella which isabella never felt herself perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabella's sister but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend without praise and without blindness but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into the want of respectful forbearance towards her father there he had not always the patience that could have been wished mr woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed it did not often happen for mr john knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law and generally a strong sense of what was due to him but it was too often for emma's charity especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured though the offence came not the beginning however of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality they had not been long seated and composed when mr woodhouse with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh called his daughter's attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last,1,1,0.9982672709710536
oh no -- none in the least i never saw mrs weston better in my life -- never looking so well papa is only speaking his own regret,1,1,0.9446157425459569
why to be sure said mr woodhouse -- yes certainly -- i cannot deny that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often -- but then -- she is always obliged to go away again,1,1,0.9893729610337607
but you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father he wrote a letter to poor mrs weston to congratulate her and a very proper handsome letter it was she shewed it to me i thought it very well done of him indeed whether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell he is but young and his uncle perhaps --,1,1,0.97710463008018
if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them as you are where these children are concerned we might always think alike,1,0,0.44594579948860974
yes said he smiling -- and reason good i was sixteen years old when you were born,1,0,0.4755954186678836
but still not near enough to give me a chance of being right if we think differently,1,1,0.6800271576783585
the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits but principally of those of the elder whose temper was by much the most communicative and who was always the greater talker as a magistrate he had generally some point of law to consult john about or at least some curious anecdote to give and as a farmer as keeping in hand the home-farm at donwell he had to tell what every field was to bear next year and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life and whose attachments were strong the plan of a drain the change of a fence the felling of a tree and the destination of every acre for wheat turnips or spring corn was entered into with as much equality of interest by john as his cooler manners rendered possible and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness,1,1,0.897102811137452
emma could not suppose any such thing knowing as she did that both the mr knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself -- and two basins only were ordered after a little more discourse in praise of gruel with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body he proceeded to say with an air of grave reflection,1,1,0.9493292466579306
ah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body i am sure it almost killed me once,1,1,0.8419878110923378
it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to her -- and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation i would have spoken to --,1,1,0.9132347822515019
and she talked in this way so long and successfully that when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister she had nothing worse to hear than isabella's kind inquiry after jane fairfax and jane fairfax though no great favourite with her in general she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising,1,1,0.9946543998705887
that sweet amiable jane fairfax said mrs john knightley -- it is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them i always regret excessively on dear emma's account that she cannot be more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all she would be such a delightful companion for emma,1,1,0.9993675544824852
this topic was discussed very happily and others succeeded of similar moment and passed away with similar harmony but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation the gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable -- but unfortunately among the failures which the daughter had to instance the most recent and therefore most prominent was in her own cook at south end a young woman hired for the time who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel thin but not too thin often as she had wished for and ordered it she had never been able to get any thing tolerable here was a dangerous opening,1,1,0.9451749947178556
how they were all to be conveyed he would have made a difficulty if he could but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses were actually at hartfield he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head it hardly amounted to a doubt nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for harriet also,1,1,0.9568381846520378
the evening before this great event for it was a very great event that mr woodhouse should dine out on the 24th of december had been spent by harriet at hartfield and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold that but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by mrs goddard emma could not have allowed her to leave the house emma called on her the next day and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat mrs goddard was full of care and affection mr perry was talked of and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement though she could not speak of her loss without many tears,1,1,0.9993948594975899
you do quite right said she -- we will make your apologies to mr and mrs weston,1,1,0.9092314477642037
well said she to herself this is most strange -- after i had got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave harriet ill behind -- most strange indeed -- but there is i believe in many men especially single men such an inclination -- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures their employments their dignities almost their duties that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with mr elton a most valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly and very much in love with harriet but still he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked what a strange thing love is he can see ready wit in harriet but will not dine alone for her,1,1,0.9482908604880326
after a few minutes of entire silence between them john knightley began with --,1,1,0.8047417610387945
i do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly i think your manners to him encouraging i speak as a friend emma you had better look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do,1,1,0.8564134091372964
mr woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit that in spite of the increasing coldness he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others too full of the wonder of his own going and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was cold and too well wrapt up to feel it the cold however was severe and by the time the second carriage was in motion a few flakes of snow were finding their way down and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time,1,1,0.946294149610353
they arrived the carriage turned the step was let down and mr elton spruce black and smiling was with them instantly emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject mr elton was all obligation and cheerfulness he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed that she began to think he must have received a different account of harriet from what had reached her she had sent while dressing and the answer had been much the same -- not better,1,1,0.9875936484394607
this was very proper the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable but it should have lasted longer emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment,1,1,0.7996825546909879
yes said john knightley and i think we shall have a good deal of it,1,1,0.9134158564458852
at another time emma might have been amused but she was too much astonished now at mr elton's spirits for other feelings harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party,1,1,0.996561486117412
some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs weston's drawing-room -- mr elton must compose his joyous looks and mr john knightley disperse his ill-humour mr elton must smile less and mr john knightley more to fit them for the place -- emma only might be as nature prompted and shew herself just as happy as she was to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons mr weston was a great favourite and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve as to his wife not any one to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood of being always interesting and always intelligible the little affairs arrangements perplexities and pleasures of her father and herself she could tell nothing of hartfield in which mrs weston had not a lively concern and half an hour's uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends was one of the first gratifications of each,1,1,0.998975823704768
the misfortune of harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival mr woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it besides all the history of his own and isabella's coming and of emma's being to follow and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his daughter when the others appeared and mrs weston who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma,1,1,0.9904543617332323
we want only two more to be just the right number i should like to see two more here -- your pretty little friend miss smith and my son -- and then i should say we were quite complete i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting frank i had a letter from him this morning and he will be with us within a fortnight,1,1,0.9029466582317567
emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure and fully assented to his proposition of mr frank churchill and miss smith making their party quite complete,1,1,0.9893093565945926
yes she would be but that she thinks there will be another put-off she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do but she does not know the parties so well as i do the case you see is -- but this is quite between ourselves i did not mention a syllable of it in the other room there are secrets in all families you know -- the case is that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january and that frank's coming depends upon their being put off if they are not put off he cannot stir but i know they will because it is a family that a certain lady of some consequence at enscombe has a particular dislike to and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years they always are put off when it comes to the point i have not the smallest doubt of the issue i am as confident of seeing frank here before the middle of january as i am of being here myself but your good friend there nodding towards the upper end of the table has so few vagaries herself and has been so little used to them at hartfield that she cannot calculate on their effects as i have been long in the practice of doing,1,1,0.9430314419475713
yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world,1,1,0.9473363032667218
emma wished she had been alone with mrs weston she should then have heard more mrs weston would speak to her with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella and she really believed would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her excepting those views on the young man of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge but at present there was nothing more to be said mr woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room to be sitting long after dinner was a confinement that he could not endure neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable,1,1,0.9975318664243731
he ought to come said emma if he could stay only a couple of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having it in his power to do as much as that a young woman if she fall into bad hands may be teazed and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young man 's being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it,1,1,0.8921478573515077
one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do replied mrs weston one ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe i believe certainly must not be judged by general rules she is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her,1,1,0.9639438628938596
my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it you must let it go its own way i have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will be,1,1,0.8202177193649818
mr woodhouse was soon ready for his tea and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home and it was as much as his three companions could do to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour before the other gentlemen appeared mr weston was chatty and convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation mr elton in very good spirits was one of the first to walk in mrs weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa he joined them immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself between them,1,1,0.9901744067131626
emma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of mr frank churchill was willing to forget his late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before and on his making harriet his very first subject was ready to listen with most friendly smiles,1,1,0.9885341788566981
he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend -- her fair lovely amiable friend did she know -- had she heard any thing about her since their being at randalls -- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably and in this style he talked on for some time very properly not much attending to any answer but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat and emma was quite in charity with him,1,1,0.9755550691681758
but at last there seemed a perverse turn it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account than on harriet's -- more anxious that she should escape the infection than that there should be no infection in the complaint he began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber again for the present -- to entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr perry and learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her she was vexed it did appear -- there was no concealing it -- exactly like the pretence of being in love with her instead of harriet an inconstancy if real the most contemptible and abominable and she had difficulty in behaving with temper he turned to mrs weston to implore her assistance would not she give him her support -- would not she add her persuasions to his to induce miss woodhouse not to go to mrs goddard's till it were certain that miss smith's disorder had no infection he could not be satisfied without a promise -- would not she give him her influence in procuring it,1,1,0.9947147269065141
so scrupulous for others he continued and yet so careless for herself she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself is this fair mrs weston -- judge between us have not i some right to complain i am sure of your kind support and aid,1,1,0.9412203185513068
his eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own the horror of being blocked up at randalls while her children were at hartfield was full in her imagination and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people but in a state that admitted no delay she was eager to have it settled that her father and emma should remain at randalls while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them,1,1,0.9710551692276956
isabella turned to mrs weston for her approbation of the plan mrs weston could only approve isabella then went to emma but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away and they were still discussing the point when mr knightley who had left the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow came back again and told them that he had been out of doors to examine and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home whenever they liked it either now or an hour hence he had gone beyond the sweep -- some way along the highbury road -- the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep -- in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground a very few flakes were falling at present but the clouds were parting and there was every appearance of its being soon over he had seen the coachmen and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend,1,1,0.9774262328191272
i am very much astonished mr elton this to me you forget yourself -- you take me for my friend -- any message to miss smith i shall be happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please,1,1,0.9214467523970208
but mr elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits not at all to confuse his intellects he perfectly knew his own meaning and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious and slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend -- but acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned at all -- he resumed the subject of his own passion and was very urgent for a favourable answer,1,1,0.9624111164324468
as she thought less of his inebriety she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption and with fewer struggles for politeness replied,1,1,0.7143740003081336
it would be impossible to say what emma felt on hearing this -- which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost she was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr elton's sanguine state of mind he tried to take her hand again as he joyously exclaimed --,1,1,0.9794602363697378
no sir cried emma it confesses no such thing so far from having long understood you i have been in a most complete error with respect to your views till this moment as to myself i am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings -- nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend harriet -- your pursuit of her pursuit it appeared gave me great pleasure and i have been very earnestly wishing you success but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smith -- that you have never thought seriously of her,1,1,0.9963273538420772
he was too angry to say another word her manner too decided to invite supplication and in this state of swelling resentment and mutually deep mortification they had to continue together a few minutes longer for the fears of mr woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace if there had not been so much anger there would have been desperate awkwardness but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment without knowing when the carriage turned into vicarage lane or when it stopped they found themselves all at once at the door of his house and he was out before another syllable passed -- emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night the compliment was just returned coldly and proudly and under indescribable irritation of spirits she was then conveyed to hartfield,1,1,0.9685330329227282
there she was welcomed with the utmost delight by her father who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from vicarage lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of -- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no james and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well for mr john knightley ashamed of his ill-humour was now all kindness and attention and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party except herself -- but her mind had never been in such perturbation and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection,1,1,0.9861106017303518
contrary to the usual course of things mr elton's wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion his professions and his proposals did him no service she thought nothing of his attachment and was insulted by his hopes he wanted to marry well and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her pretended to be in love but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for there had been no real affection either in his language or manners sighs and fine words had been given in abundance but she could hardly devise any set of expressions or fancy any tone of voice less allied with real love she need not trouble herself to pity him he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself and if miss woodhouse of hartfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for miss somebody else with twenty or with ten,1,1,0.9915326964936381
she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse and then resumed a more serious more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been and might be and must be the distressing explanation she had to make to harriet and all that poor harriet would be suffering with the awkwardness of future meetings the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance of subduing feelings concealing resentment and avoiding eclat were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully,1,1,0.9863414279439949
to youth and natural cheerfulness like emma's though under temporary gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits the youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy and of powerful operation and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope,1,1,0.8172995999476755
it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house too wise to stir out and to hear him say to mr knightley whom no weather could keep entirely from them --,1,1,0.9698658389287246
ah mr knightley why do not you stay at home like poor mr elton,1,1,0.9584029992004502
mr and mrs john knightley were not detained long at hartfield the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move and mr woodhouse having as usual tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children was obliged to see the whole party set off and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor isabella -- which poor isabella passing her life with those she doated on full of their merits blind to their faults and always innocently busy might have been a model of right feminine happiness,1,1,0.9866964472259553
time she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr elton in particular but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriet's age and with the entire extinction of all hope such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of mr elton's return as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them,1,1,0.9904002843555813
if mr elton on his return made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do she could not imagine harriet's persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him,1,1,0.9823032608309812
mrs weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed in fact than her husband though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober but a sanguine temper though for ever expecting more good than occurs does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression it soon flies over the present failure and begins to hope again for half an hour mr weston was surprized and sorry but then he began to perceive that frank's coming two or three months later would be a much better plan better time of year better weather and that he would be able without any doubt to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner,1,1,0.9940503475298413
these feelings rapidly restored his comfort while mrs weston of a more apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer suffered a great deal more herself,1,1,0.9824172619118913
i do not know why you should say so he wishes exceedingly to come but his uncle and aunt will not spare him,1,1,0.8582899768458451
it is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with mrs churchill's temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others,1,1,0.9808880400770252
they were just approaching the house where lived mrs and miss bates she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers there was always sufficient reason for such an attention mrs and miss bates loved to be called on and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her as rather negligent in that respect and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts,1,1,0.9820361950880007
she had had many a hint from mr knightley and some from her own heart as to her deficiency -- but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable -- a waste of time -- tiresome women -- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and third-rate of highbury who were calling on them for ever and therefore she seldom went near them but now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in -- observing as she proposed it to harriet that as well as she could calculate they were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax,1,1,0.9854937349632307
the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr elton there was intimacy between them and mr cole had heard from mr elton since his going away emma knew what was coming they must have the letter over again and settle how long he had been gone and how much he was engaged in company and what a favourite he was wherever he went and how full the master of the ceremonies' ball had been and she went through it very well with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite and always putting forward to prevent harriet's being obliged to say a word,1,1,0.9867576522961057
thank you you are very kind yes next week every body is so surprized and every body says the same obliging things i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they can be to see her yes friday or saturday she cannot say which because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days so very good of them to send her the whole way but they always do you know oh yes friday or saturday next that is what she writes about that is the reason of her writing out of rule as we call it for in the common course we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday,1,1,0.9428243636465233
yes so i imagined i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to-day,1,1,0.9495201217716611
i am afraid we must be running away said emma glancing at harriet and beginning to rise -- my father will be expecting us i had no intention i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes when i first entered the house i merely called because i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs bates but i have been so pleasantly detained now however we must wish you and mrs bates good morning,1,1,0.9811173657708223
the marriage of lieut fairfax of the regiment of infantry and miss jane bates had had its day of fame and pleasure hope and interest but nothing now remained of it save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl,1,1,0.9257267822841323
by birth she belonged to highbury and when at three years old on losing her mother she became the property the charge the consolation the fondling of her grandmother and aunt there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there of her being taught only what very limited means could command and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person good understanding and warm-hearted well-meaning relations,1,1,0.9669200125498286
the good sense of colonel and mrs campbell could not oppose such a resolution though their feelings did as long as they lived no exertions would be necessary their home might be hers for ever and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly but this would be selfishness -- what must be at last had better be soon perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished still however affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment she had never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength they must forbid her engaging in duties which so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits seemed under the most favourable circumstances to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort,1,1,0.9965198214809559
upon the whole emma left her with such softened charitable feelings as made her look around in walking home and lament that highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her,1,1,0.9742537887083098
if any thing could be more where all was most she was more reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr dixon's character or her own value for his company or opinion of the suitableness of the match it was all general approbation and smoothness nothing delineated or distinguished it did her no service however her caution was thrown away emma saw its artifice and returned to her first surmises there probably was something more to conceal than her own preference mr dixon perhaps had been very near changing one friend for the other or been fixed only to miss campbell for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds,1,1,0.9931718071008155
i hope every body had a pleasant evening said mr woodhouse in his quiet way i had once i felt the fire rather too much but then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me miss bates was very chatty and good-humoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick however she is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way i like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed she must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she had emma,1,1,0.9972844735100173
true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax,1,1,0.9816520636830637
emma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for the present said and with a sincerity which no one could question --,1,1,0.8709113772362002
she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from i am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart,1,1,0.759627583669201
mr knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express and before he could make any reply mr woodhouse whose thoughts were on the bates's said --,1,1,0.9720291367466286
it was short -- merely to announce -- but cheerful exulting of course -- here was a sly glance at emma he had been so fortunate as to -- i forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them the information was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins by his style i should imagine it just settled,1,1,0.938828816035928
a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse said miss bates joyfully my mother is so pleased -- she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress this is great news indeed jane you have never seen mr elton -- no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him,1,1,0.9914958923108707
no -- i have never seen mr elton she replied starting on this appeal is he -- is he a tall man,1,1,0.6327023211620999
handsome oh no -- far from it -- certainly plain i told you he was plain,1,1,0.5726532279105083
very sincerely did emma wish to do so but it was not immediately in her power she was obliged to stop and think she was not thoroughly comfortable herself the young man's conduct and his sister's seemed the result of real feeling and she could not but pity them as harriet described it there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour but she had believed them to be well-meaning worthy people before and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion it was folly to be disturbed by it of course he must be sorry to lose her -- they must be all sorry ambition as well as love had probably been mortified they might all have hoped to rise by harriet's acquaintance and besides what was the value of harriet's description -- so easily pleased -- so little discerning -- what signified her praise,1,1,0.9967008003692561
mr elton's rights however gradually revived though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before or an hour before its interest soon increased and before their first conversation was over she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity wonder and regret pain and pleasure as to this fortunate miss hawkins which could conduce to place the martins under proper subordination in her fancy,1,1,0.9917179061319457
a week had not passed since miss hawkins's name was first mentioned in highbury before she was by some means or other discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind to be handsome elegant highly accomplished and perfectly amiable and when mr elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects and circulate the fame of her merits there was very little more for him to do than to tell her christian name and say whose music she principally played,1,1,0.9908203630026077
mr elton returned a very happy man he had gone away rejected and mortified -- disappointed in a very sanguine hope after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement and not only losing the right lady but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one he had gone away deeply offended -- he came back engaged to another -- and to another as superior of course to the first as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost he came back gay and self-satisfied eager and busy caring nothing for miss woodhouse and defying miss smith,1,1,0.9769784653382033
had it been allowable entertainment had there been no pain to her friend or reproach to herself in the waverings of harriet's mind emma would have been amused by its variations sometimes mr elton predominated sometimes the martins and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other mr elton's engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr martin the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by elizabeth martin's calling at mrs goddard's a few days afterwards harriet had not been at home but a note had been prepared and left for her written in the very style to touch a small mixture of reproach with a great deal of kindness and till mr elton himself appeared she had been much occupied by it continually pondering over what could be done in return and wishing to do more than she dared to confess but mr elton in person had driven away all such cares while he staid the martins were forgotten and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again emma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned judged it best for her to return elizabeth martin's visit,1,1,0.9993791206195327
harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account she was feeling too much but at last emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it was creating she had seen only mrs martin and the two girls they had received her doubtingly if not coolly and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time -- till just at last when mrs martin's saying all of a sudden that she thought miss smith was grown had brought on a more interesting subject and a warmer manner in that very room she had been measured last september with her two friends there were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window he had done it they all seemed to remember the day the hour the party the occasion -- to feel the same consciousness the same regrets -- to be ready to return to the same good understanding and they were just growing again like themselves harriet as emma must suspect as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy when the carriage reappeared and all was over the style of the visit and the shortness of it were then felt to be decisive fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago -- emma could not but picture it all and feel how justly they might resent how naturally harriet must suffer it was a bad business she would have given a great deal or endured a great deal to have had the martins in a higher rank of life they were so deserving that a little higher should have been enough but as it was how could she have done otherwise -- impossible -- she could not repent they must be separated but there was a great deal of pain in the process -- so much to herself at this time that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation and resolved on going home by way of randalls to procure it her mind was quite sick of mr elton and the martins the refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary,1,1,0.9989952805148459
it was a good scheme but on driving to the door they heard that neither master nor mistress was at home they had both been out some time the man believed they were gone to hartfield,1,1,0.7077606589534584
well well i am ready -- and turning again to emma but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my account you know i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary -- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction,1,1,0.9242554109492814
emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing,1,1,0.6815463831593267
four o'clock -- depend upon it he will be here by three was mr weston's quick amendment and so ended a most satisfactory meeting emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness every thing wore a different air james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before when she looked at the hedges she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out and when she turned round to harriet she saw something like a look of spring a tender smile even there,1,1,0.9090042537961204
she opened the parlour door and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- mr weston and his son they had been arrived only a few minutes and mr weston had scarcely finished his explanation of frank's being a day before his time and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations when she appeared to have her share of surprize introduction and pleasure,1,1,0.9780597301836667
the frank churchill so long talked of so high in interest was actually before her -- he was presented to her and she did not think too much had been said in his praise he was a very good looking young man height air address all were unexceptionable and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father's he looked quick and sensible she felt immediately that she should like him and there was a well-bred ease of manner and a readiness to talk which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her and that acquainted they soon must be,1,1,0.9856290376286364
it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it said the young man though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far but in coming home i felt i might do any thing,1,1,0.7093045200058572
the word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable the conviction was strengthened by what followed he was very much pleased with randalls thought it a most admirably arranged house would hardly allow it even to be very small admired the situation the walk to highbury highbury itself hartfield still more and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one's own country gives and the greatest curiosity to visit it that he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before passed suspiciously through emma's brain but still if it were a falsehood it was a pleasant one and pleasantly handled his manner had no air of study or exaggeration he did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment,1,1,0.9912379357113205
she had no doubt of what mr weston was often thinking about his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression and even when he might have determined not to look she was confident that he was often listening,1,1,0.8781787200822486
her own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion was a most comfortable circumstance happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it -- though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them she blessed the favouring blindness he could now without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest give way to all his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after mr frank churchill's accommodation on his journey through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which however he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night,1,1,0.9844600375210905
ill very ill -- that is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill but the expression is hardly admissible mrs weston is it ladies can never look ill and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health -- a most deplorable want of complexion,1,1,0.9594281584291227
did you see her often at weymouth were you often in the same society,1,1,0.7448915949357906
yes mr dixon and miss campbell were the persons and i thought it a very strong proof,1,1,0.9390302478129247
poor comfort said emma laughing one would rather have a stranger preferred than one's very particular friend -- with a stranger it might not recur again -- but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself -- poor mrs dixon well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland,1,1,0.9435183317897806
oh do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfax's sensations from you or from any body else they are known to no human being i guess but herself but if she continued to play whenever she was asked by mr dixon one may guess what one chuses,1,1,0.9576329100809781
i have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate -- that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends but we never did i hardly know how it has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set and then her reserve -- i never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved,1,1,0.9358119547654887
not till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction may be the greater but i must be more in want of a friend or an agreeable companion than i have yet been to take the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question i have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal,1,1,0.9387787610280153
with this treatment mr woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual he should be happy to see mrs goddard he had a great regard for mrs goddard and emma should write a line and invite her james could take the note but first of all there must be an answer written to mrs cole,1,1,0.9932824839908309
oh no my love but you will soon be tired there will be a great many people talking at once you will not like the noise,1,0,0.49410693852106996
but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles emma's going away directly after tea might be giving offence they are good-natured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment and miss woodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any other person's in the room you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years,1,1,0.9790820246438663
no upon no account in the world mr weston i am much obliged to you for reminding me i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain i know what worthy people they are perry tells me that mr cole never touches malt liquor you would not think it to look at him but he is bilious -- mr cole is very bilious no i would not be the means of giving them any pain my dear emma we must consider this i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting mr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish you will not regard being tired you will be perfectly safe you know among your friends,1,1,0.9880339523074494
oh yes papa i have no fears at all for myself and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs weston but on your account i am only afraid of your sitting up for me i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs goddard she loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort you must promise me not to sit up,1,1,0.9654579389042784
frank churchill came back again and if he kept his father's dinner waiting it was not known at hartfield for mrs weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr woodhouse to betray any imperfection which could be concealed,1,1,0.9919861097442739
yes i should i am sure i should there is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them you think you carry it off very well i dare say but with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances now you have nothing to try for you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed you are not striving to look taller than any body else now i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you,1,1,0.8183049730276755
emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with mr knightley she was received with a cordial respect which could not but please and given all the consequence she could wish for when the westons arrived the kindest looks of love the strongest of admiration were for her from both husband and wife the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and as she firmly believed not without some dexterity on his side,1,1,0.9853105655813852
the party was rather large as it included one other family a proper unobjectionable country family whom the coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance and the male part of mr cox's family the lawyer of highbury the less worthy females were to come in the evening with miss bates miss fairfax and miss smith but already at dinner they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general and while politics and mr elton were talked over emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour the first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend was the name of jane fairfax mrs cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting she listened and found it well worth listening to that very dear part of emma her fancy received an amusing supply mrs cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte -- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand but a large-sized square pianoforte and the substance of the story the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize and inquiry and congratulations on her side and explanations on miss bates's was that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwood's the day before to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected that at first by miss bates's account jane herself was quite at a loss quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it -- but now they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter -- of course it must be from colonel campbell,1,1,0.999705123136478
one can suppose nothing else added mrs cole and i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt but jane it seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it she knows their ways best but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present they might chuse to surprize her,1,1,0.9868729295935739
i declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction -- it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax who plays so delightfully should not have an instrument it seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure and it was but yesterday i was telling mr cole i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room while i do not know one note from another and our little girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amuse herself with -- i was saying this to mr cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it -- we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening,1,1,0.9883696280408355
the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me i wanted to know a little more and this tells me quite enough depend upon it we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mrs dixon,1,1,0.9451340208765378
the unpersuadable point which he did not mention emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father,1,1,0.8937587308275315
no said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all i have no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself fit to be seen,1,1,0.7934574029756684
he started thank you for rousing me he replied i believe i have been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that i cannot keep my eyes from her i never saw any thing so outree -- those curls -- this must be a fancy of her own i see nobody else looking like her -- i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion shall i -- yes i will -- i declare i will -- and you shall see how she takes it -- whether she colours,1,1,0.8008310751589458
he was gone immediately and emma soon saw him standing before miss fairfax and talking to her but as to its effect on the young lady as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them exactly in front of miss fairfax she could absolutely distinguish nothing,1,1,0.9844618327258828
this is the luxury of a large party said she -- one can get near every body and say every thing my dear emma i am longing to talk to you i have been making discoveries and forming plans just like yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh do you know how miss bates and her niece came here,1,1,0.9205941230295078
very likely said emma -- nothing more likely i know no man more likely than mr knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good-natured useful considerate or benevolent he is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this considering jane fairfax's ill-health would appear a case of humanity to him -- and for an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr knightley i know he had horses to-day -- for we arrived together and i laughed at him about it but he said not a word that could betray,1,1,0.9746758709847867
if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself a very shameful and degrading connexion how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to him -- to have her haunting the abbey and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane -- so very kind and obliging -- but he always had been such a very kind neighbour ' and then fly off through half a sentence to her mother's old petticoat not that it was such a very old petticoat either -- for still it would last a great while -- and indeed she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong ',1,1,0.9703373579409087
quite out of the question quite out of the question he replied -- but you must often wish it i am sure and he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another step,1,1,0.7422712782558827
from that moment emma could have taken her oath that mr knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument but whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a little longer doubtful towards the end of jane's second song her voice grew thick,1,1,0.9166013099868773
another song however was soon begged for one more -- they would not fatigue miss fairfax on any account and would only ask for one more and frank churchill was heard to say i think you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling the strength of the song falls on the second,1,1,0.914740426259455
emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity she must have delighted the coles -- worthy people who deserved to be made happy -- and left a name behind her that would not soon die away,1,1,0.9313996040615022
she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there he sat by her at dinner miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry him,1,1,0.9671972446680887
should i send it to mrs goddard's ma'am asked mrs ford -- yes -- no -- yes to mrs goddard's only my pattern gown is at hartfield no you shall send it to hartfield if you please but then mrs goddard will want to see it -- and i could take the pattern gown home any day but i shall want the ribbon directly -- so it had better go to hartfield -- at least the ribbon you could make it into two parcels mrs ford could not you,1,1,0.9642879092196596
oh but indeed i would much rather have it only in one then if you please you shall send it all to mrs goddard's -- i do not know -- no i think miss woodhouse i may just as well have it sent to hartfield and take it home with me at night what do you advise,1,1,0.9280885807365113
how do you do mrs ford i beg your pardon i did not see you before i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town jane came back delighted yesterday thank ye the gloves do very well -- only a little too large about the wrist but jane is taking them in,1,1,0.8824470047484047
how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion miss fairfax i dare say they often think of you and wonder which will be the day the precise day of the instrument's coming to hand do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time -- do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may have sent only a general direction an order indefinite as to time to depend upon contingencies and conveniences,1,1,0.9480695412358819
till i have a letter from colonel campbell said she in a voice of forced calmness i can imagine nothing with any confidence it must be all conjecture,1,1,0.9437941001149174
what felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy -- if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth,1,1,0.7546554056825471
she looked up at him for a moment coloured deeply and played something else he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte and turning to emma said,1,1,0.7378848591638987
here is something quite new to me do you know it -- cramer -- and here are a new set of irish melodies that from such a quarter one might expect this was all sent with the instrument very thoughtful of colonel campbell was not it -- he knew miss fairfax could have no music here i honour that part of the attention particularly it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart nothing hastily done nothing incomplete true affection only could have prompted it,1,1,0.9421605103000255
he brought all the music to her and they looked it over together -- emma took the opportunity of whispering,1,1,0.7395125571722648
no not now i thank you i could not stay two minutes i must get on to kingston as fast as i can,1,1,0.6982599008157137
oh do come in they will be so very happy to see you,1,1,0.6191980762422686
well i am so sorry -- oh mr knightley what a delightful party last night how extremely pleasant -- did you ever see such dancing -- was not it delightful -- miss woodhouse and mr frank churchill i never saw any thing equal to it,1,1,0.9958788392642848
frank churchill had danced once at highbury and longed to dance again and the last half-hour of an evening which mr woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject frank's was the first idea and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr frank churchill and miss woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour in the hope of discovering in spite of all that mr weston could say of their exactly equal size that it was a little the largest,1,1,0.9962981121970014
but will there be good room for five couple -- i really do not think there will,1,1,0.6996402476123885
oh no said he it would be the extreme of imprudence i could not bear it for emma -- emma is not strong she would catch a dreadful cold so would poor little harriet so you would all mrs weston you would be quite laid up do not let them talk of such a wild thing pray do not let them talk of it that young man speaking lower is very thoughtless do not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing he has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping them open very inconsiderately he does not think of the draught i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite the thing,1,1,0.8965698670606599
very true he gravely replied it was very bad but still he went on measuring and still he ended with,1,0,0.4502041813225032
no no said she you are quite unreasonable it would be dreadful to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd -- and a crowd in a little room,1,1,0.6243517151220466
there is no denying it he replied i agree with you exactly a crowd in a little room -- miss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words exquisite quite exquisite -- still however having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up it would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- i do not know that -- i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well,1,1,0.8770841616817979
from the very circumstance of its being larger sir we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief,1,0,0.46260022238224463
oh interrupted emma there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over there is no hurry at all if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses they will be so near their own stable,1,1,0.8792828104040789
there papa -- now you must be satisfied -- our own dear mrs weston who is carefulness itself do not you remember what mr perry said so many years ago when i had the measles if miss taylor undertakes to wrap miss emma up you need not have any fears sir ' how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her,1,1,0.9930043852024818
and mr weston at the same time walking briskly with long steps through the passage was calling out,1,0,0.45279757420102695
you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear it is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from the stairs,1,1,0.501162002273485
i wish said mrs weston one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object -- if one could but tell what that would be,1,1,0.9228978979431433
yes very true cried frank very true you want your neighbours' opinions i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the coles for instance they are not far off shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer -- and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body i think we do want a larger council suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us,1,1,0.9269325179956346
long before he reappeared attending the short neat brisk-moving aunt and her elegant niece -- mrs weston like a sweet-tempered woman and a good wife had examined the passage again and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before -- indeed very trifling and here ended the difficulties of decision all the rest in speculation at least was perfectly smooth all the minor arrangements of table and chair lights and music tea and supper made themselves or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between mrs weston and mrs stokes -- every body invited was certainly to come frank had already written to enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight which could not possibly be refused and a delightful dance it was to be,1,1,0.9844897350413738
enscombe however was gracious gracious in fact if not in word his wish of staying longer evidently did not please but it was not opposed all was safe and prosperous and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another emma being now certain of her ball began to adopt as the next vexation mr knightley's provoking indifference about it either because he did not dance himself or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted he seemed resolved that it should not interest him determined against its exciting any present curiosity or affording him any future amusement to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply than,1,1,0.9886152600082815
very well if the westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment i have nothing to say against it but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me -- oh yes i must be there i could not refuse and i will keep as much awake as i can but i would rather be at home looking over william larkins's week's account much rather i confess -- pleasure in seeing dancing -- not i indeed -- i never look at it -- i do not know who does -- fine dancing i believe like virtue must be its own reward those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different,1,1,0.9101161455365847
but you will come again said emma this will not be your only visit to randalls,1,1,0.933757252662379
indeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance i would much rather have been merry than wise,1,1,0.7591918045133711
in short said he perhaps miss woodhouse -- i think you can hardly be quite without suspicion --,1,1,0.9296008896044456
you are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then --,1,1,0.6069537734270781
mr knightley however shewed no triumphant happiness he could not say that he was sorry on his own account his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had but he said and very steadily that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others and with considerable kindness added,1,1,0.959375945489169
it was some days before she saw jane fairfax to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change but when they did meet her composure was odious she had been particularly unwell however suffering from headache to a degree which made her aunt declare that had the ball taken place she did not think jane could have attended it and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill-health,1,1,0.9885689026362564
i do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice said she -- in not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives is there any allusion to making a sacrifice i do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness so much the better i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do i am quite enough in love i should be sorry to be more,1,1,0.8576741950706223
your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr elton's marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make me you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into it was all my doing i know i have not forgotten it i assure you -- deceived myself i did very miserably deceive you -- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it,1,1,0.9741414713913544
she could not enter the house again could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago to lace up her boot without recollecting a thousand vexatious thoughts would recur compliments charades and horrible blunders and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be recollecting too but she behaved very well and was only rather pale and silent the visit was of course short and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it that emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady and on no account to give one beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being elegantly dressed and very pleasing,1,1,0.9753093273259985
i dare say returned harriet sighing again i dare say she was very much attached to him,1,1,0.926791181930333
yes but we must not rest our claims on that distinction many counties i believe are called the garden of england as well as surry,1,0,0.4752188067075579
i do not ask whether you are musical mrs elton upon these occasions a lady's character generally precedes her and highbury has long known that you are a superior performer,1,1,0.9310760857678195
we cannot suppose said emma smiling that mr elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in highbury and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the motive,1,1,0.9805045809874312
emma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music had nothing more to say and after a moment's pause mrs elton chose another subject,1,1,0.9811152406533049
emma was almost too much astonished to answer but mrs elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on,1,1,0.9571784593395087
mrs weston's manners said emma were always particularly good their propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest model for any young woman,1,1,0.9785007357162454
and who do you think came in while we were there,1,0,0.4068805786949013
emma was quite at a loss the tone implied some old acquaintance -- and how could she possibly guess,1,1,0.9245078092384632
all this ran so glibly through her thoughts that by the time her father had arranged himself after the bustle of the eltons' departure and was ready to speak she was very tolerably capable of attending,1,1,0.8938722707756648
emma was not required by any subsequent discovery to retract her ill opinion of mrs elton her observation had been pretty correct such as mrs elton appeared to her on this second interview such she appeared whenever they met again -- self-important presuming familiar ignorant and ill-bred she had a little beauty and a little accomplishment but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood and conceived miss hawkins to have held such a place in society as mrs elton's consequence only could surpass,1,1,0.9977758037591562
upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject before the few who knew her opinion of mrs elton mrs weston ventured this apology for jane,1,1,0.9921633000965583
we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage my dear emma -- but it is better than being always at home her aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome we must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for what she goes to,1,1,0.9740084848080547
another thing must be taken into consideration too -- mrs elton does not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a something more early implanted we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before we feel things differently and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs elton's way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness,1,1,0.996645543487188
he stopped -- emma felt her foot pressed by mrs weston and did not herself know what to think in a moment he went on --,1,1,0.9566348142762999
he seemed hardly to hear her he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased soon afterwards said,1,1,0.8922507435592838
so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax,1,1,0.9694052470066146
mr knightley was thoughtful again the result of his reverie was no emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize -- i never had a thought of her in that way i assure you and soon afterwards jane fairfax is a very charming young woman -- but not even jane fairfax is perfect she has a fault she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife,1,1,0.9965126337456136
every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr elton was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage dinner-parties and evening-parties were made for him and his lady and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day,1,1,0.987642500654337
no invitation came amiss to her her bath habits made evening-parties perfectly natural to her and maple grove had given her a taste for dinners she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms at the poor attempt at rout-cakes and there being no ice in the highbury card-parties mrs bates mrs perry mrs goddard and others were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order,1,1,0.9947873301492036
you are speaking of letters of business mine are letters of friendship,1,1,0.5518231709184269
i am very sorry to hear miss fairfax of your being out this morning in the rain young ladies should take care of themselves -- young ladies are delicate plants they should take care of their health and their complexion my dear did you change your stockings,1,1,0.9155159890122415
my dear jane what is this i hear -- going to the post-office in the rain -- this must not be i assure you -- you sad girl how could you do such a thing -- it is a sign i was not there to take care of you,1,1,0.8181625379306089
my advice said mrs weston kindly and persuasively i certainly do feel tempted to give miss fairfax you must not run such risks -- liable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly careful especially at this time of year the spring i always think requires more than common care better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again now do not you feel that you had yes i am sure you are much too reasonable you look as if you would not do such a thing again,1,1,0.9669953777454756
oh she shall not do such a thing again eagerly rejoined mrs elton we will not allow her to do such a thing again -- and nodding significantly -- there must be some arrangement made there must indeed i shall speak to mr e the man who fetches our letters every morning one of our men i forget his name shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you that will obviate all difficulties you know and from us i really think my dear jane you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation,1,1,0.9432840306272134
jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered but instead of answering she began speaking again to mr john knightley,1,1,0.9475393730038628
so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears so seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million i suppose actually lost and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder,1,1,0.5682821625251467
yes said his brother hesitatingly there is a likeness i know what you mean -- but emma's hand is the strongest,1,1,0.6754570899823727
isabella and emma both write beautifully said mr woodhouse and always did and so does poor mrs weston -- with half a sigh and half a smile at her,1,1,0.9875950339629616
i never saw any gentleman's handwriting -- emma began looking also at mrs weston but stopped on perceiving that mrs weston was attending to some one else -- and the pause gave her time to reflect now how am i going to introduce him -- am i unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase -- your yorkshire friend -- your correspondent in yorkshire -- that would be the way i suppose if i were very bad -- no i can pronounce his name without the smallest distress i certainly get better and better -- now for it,1,1,0.9683473662778288
must i go first i really am ashamed of always leading the way,1,1,0.6172317987046674
jane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma she had heard and seen it all and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any she suspected that it had that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear and that it had not been in vain she thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual -- a glow both of complexion and spirits,1,1,0.9848954467650071
but i have never fixed on june or any other month -- merely looked forward to the summer in general,1,1,0.6678420592310209
i not aware said jane shaking her head dear mrs elton who can have thought of it as i have done,1,1,0.9637847712527671
colonel and mrs campbell are to be in town again by midsummer said jane i must spend some time with them i am sure they will want it -- afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present,1,1,0.9700415312603247
trouble aye i know your scruples you are afraid of giving me trouble but i assure you my dear jane the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am i shall write to mrs partridge in a day or two and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible,1,1,0.9296194273356575
oh my dear human flesh you quite shock me if you mean a fling at the slave-trade i assure you mr suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition,1,0,0.41897972949805473
something that would do repeated mrs elton aye that may suit your humble ideas of yourself -- i know what a modest creature you are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation in a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command the elegancies of life,1,1,0.9236611419350658
you are very obliging but as to all that i am very indifferent it would be no object to me to be with the rich my mortifications i think would only be the greater i should suffer more from comparison a gentleman's family is all that i should condition for,1,1,0.8622111671142694
in this style she ran on never thoroughly stopped by any thing till mr woodhouse came into the room her vanity had then a change of object and emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to jane,1,1,0.972108211550968
read it read it said he it will give you pleasure only a few lines -- will not take you long read it to emma,1,1,0.6927532248526769
it was well that he took every body's joy for granted or he might not have thought either mr woodhouse or mr knightley particularly delighted they were the first entitled after mrs weston and emma to be made happy -- from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley that it would have been too positive an interruption and finding himself close to mrs elton and her attention disengaged he necessarily began on the subject with her,1,1,0.9989581630037887
mrs elton very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope smiled most graciously,1,1,0.9791001273853726
oh yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance i am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on him and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage,1,1,0.9557518052863041
you are very obliging -- frank will be extremely happy i am sure -- he is to be in town next week if not sooner we have notice of it in a letter to-day i met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my son's hand presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to mrs weston she is his principal correspondent i assure you i hardly ever get a letter,1,1,0.9875445124011726
i rather hope to satisfy you both said emma for i shall do all in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic,1,1,0.9396304795789086
yes said his brother quickly it is randalls that does it all,1,1,0.6463061932729612
no cried mr knightley that need not be the consequence let them be sent to donwell i shall certainly be at leisure,1,1,0.9289066212050299
mrs elton was spoken of i think she must be here soon said he i have a great curiosity to see mrs elton i have heard so much of her it cannot be long i think before she comes,1,1,0.9791651104916442
so very obliging of you -- no rain at all nothing to signify i do not care for myself quite thick shoes and jane declares -- well -- as soon as she was within the door well this is brilliant indeed -- this is admirable -- excellently contrived upon my word nothing wanting could not have imagined it -- so well lighted up -- jane jane look -- did you ever see any thing oh mr weston you must really have had aladdin's lamp good mrs stokes would not know her own room again i saw her as i came in she was standing in the entrance oh mrs stokes ' said i -- but i had not time for more she was now met by mrs weston -- very well i thank you ma'am i hope you are quite well very happy to hear it so afraid you might have a headache -- seeing you pass by so often and knowing how much trouble you must have delighted to hear it indeed ah dear mrs elton so obliged to you for the carriage -- excellent time jane and i quite ready did not keep the horses a moment most comfortable carriage -- oh and i am sure our thanks are due to you mrs weston on that score mrs elton had most kindly sent jane a note or we should have been -- but two such offers in one day -- never were such neighbours i said to my mother upon my word ma'am -- ' thank you my mother is remarkably well gone to mr woodhouse's i made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl -- mrs dixon's wedding-present -- so kind of her to think of my mother bought at weymouth you know -- mr dixon's choice there were three others jane says which they hesitated about some time colonel campbell rather preferred an olive my dear jane are you sure you did not wet your feet -- it was but a drop or two but i am so afraid -- but mr frank churchill was so extremely -- and there was a mat to step upon -- i shall never forget his extreme politeness -- oh mr frank churchill i must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since the rivet never came out again my mother often talks of your good-nature does not she jane -- do not we often talk of mr frank churchill -- ah here's miss woodhouse -- dear miss woodhouse how do you do -- very well i thank you quite well this is meeting quite in fairy-land -- such a transformation -- must not compliment i know eyeing emma most complacently -- that would be rude -- but upon my word miss woodhouse you do look -- how do you like jane's hair -- you are a judge -- she did it all herself quite wonderful how she does her hair -- no hairdresser from london i think could -- ah dr hughes i declare -- and mrs hughes must go and speak to dr and mrs hughes for a moment -- how do you do how do you do -- very well i thank you this is delightful is not it -- where's dear mr richard -- oh there he is don't disturb him much better employed talking to the young ladies how do you do mr richard -- i saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- mrs otway i protest -- and good mr otway and miss otway and miss caroline -- such a host of friends -- and mr george and mr arthur -- how do you do how do you all do -- quite well i am much obliged to you never better -- don't i hear another carriage -- who can this be -- very likely the worthy coles -- upon my word this is charming to be standing about among such friends and such a noble fire -- i am quite roasted no coffee i thank you for me -- never take coffee -- a little tea if you please sir by and bye -- no hurry -- oh here it comes every thing so good,1,1,0.9979660482892398
oh you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion -- i was this moment telling jane i thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us,1,1,0.7486924807009306
how do you like mrs elton said emma in a whisper,1,1,0.9612931051741691
me -- oh no -- i would get you a better partner than myself i am no dancer,1,1,0.5622186931020235
mrs weston said no more and emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat this was mr elton the amiable obliging gentle mr elton -- she looked round for a moment he had joined mr knightley at a little distance and was arranging himself for settled conversation while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife,1,1,0.996957890342538
mr elton had retreated into the card-room looking emma trusted very foolish she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife though growing very like her -- she spoke some of her feelings by observing audibly to her partner,1,1,0.9626594591297005
jane jane my dear jane where are you -- here is your tippet mrs weston begs you to put on your tippet she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage though every thing has been done -- one door nailed up -- quantities of matting -- my dear jane indeed you must mr churchill oh you are too obliging how well you put it on -- so gratified excellent dancing indeed -- yes my dear i ran home as i said i should to help grandmama to bed and got back again and nobody missed me -- i set off without saying a word just as i told you grandmama was quite well had a charming evening with mr woodhouse a vast deal of chat and backgammon -- tea was made downstairs biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away amazing luck in some of her throws and she inquired a great deal about you how you were amused and who were your partners oh ' said i i shall not forestall jane i left her dancing with mr george otway she will love to tell you all about it herself to-morrow her first partner was mr elton i do not know who will ask her next perhaps mr william cox ' my dear sir you are too obliging -- is there nobody you would not rather -- i am not helpless sir you are most kind upon my word jane on one arm and me on the other -- stop stop let us stand a little back mrs elton is going dear mrs elton how elegant she looks -- beautiful lace -- now we all follow in her train quite the queen of the evening -- well here we are at the passage two steps jane take care of the two steps oh no there is but one well i was persuaded there were two how very odd i was convinced there were two and there is but one i never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style -- candles everywhere -- i was telling you of your grandmama jane -- there was a little disappointment -- the baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first and good mr woodhouse not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus -- so she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse who would be so very much concerned -- well this is brilliant i am all amazement could not have supposed any thing -- such elegance and profusion -- i have seen nothing like it since -- well where shall we sit where shall we sit anywhere so that jane is not in a draught where i sit is of no consequence oh do you recommend this side -- well i am sure mr churchill -- only it seems too good -- but just as you please what you direct in this house cannot be wrong dear jane how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama soup too bless me i should not be helped so soon but it smells most excellent and i cannot help beginning,1,1,0.9920941488323298
this little explanation with mr knightley gave emma considerable pleasure it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy -- she was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the eltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike and his praise of harriet his concession in her favour was peculiarly gratifying the impertinence of the eltons which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of harriet's infatuation -- from harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom she had strong hopes it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened and she were enabled to see that mr elton was not the superior creature she had believed him the fever was over and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy she depended on the evil feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite -- harriet rational frank churchill not too much in love and mr knightley not wanting to quarrel with her how very happy a summer must be before her,1,1,0.9984094810795952
miss smith and miss bickerton another parlour boarder at mrs goddard's who had been also at the ball had walked out together and taken a road the richmond road which though apparently public enough for safety had led them into alarm -- about half a mile beyond highbury making a sudden turn and deeply shaded by elms on each side it became for a considerable stretch very retired and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them on a broader patch of greensward by the side a party of gipsies a child on the watch came towards them to beg and miss bickerton excessively frightened gave a great scream and calling on harriet to follow her ran up a steep bank cleared a slight hedge at the top and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury but poor harriet could not follow she had suffered very much from cramp after dancing and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless -- and in this state and exceedingly terrified she had been obliged to remain,1,1,0.9236689193584965
in this state frank churchill had found her she trembling and conditioning they loud and insolent by a most fortunate chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment the pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward and leave his horses to meet him by another road a mile or two beyond highbury -- and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of miss bates and to have forgotten to restore them he had been obliged to stop at her door and go in for a few minutes he was therefore later than he had intended and being on foot was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then their own portion he had left them completely frightened and harriet eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak had just strength enough to reach hartfield before her spirits were quite overcome it was his idea to bring her to hartfield he had thought of no other place,1,1,0.9839653351923637
emma was a good deal surprized but begged her to speak there was a seriousness in harriet's manner which prepared her quite as much as her words for something more than ordinary,1,1,0.95367784373083
not the least in the world -- did he ever give you any thing,1,1,0.5825114213302491
here resumed harriet turning to her box again here is something still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable because this is what did really once belong to him which the court-plaister never did,1,1,0.5877035158924795
ah i do not know i cannot recollect -- it is very odd but i cannot recollect -- mr elton was sitting here i remember much about where i am now --,1,1,0.9118701609803856
oh that's all i have nothing more to shew you or to say -- except that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire and i wish you to see me do it,1,0,0.2924033524276519
oh miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose -- indeed i am not so mad -- but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance -- and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so proper in me especially,1,1,0.860989153938362
i am not at all surprized at you harriet the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart,1,1,0.9265476435756885
nay i had it from you you wrote me word of it three months ago,1,1,0.5981767927391431
no sir replied his son laughing i seem to have had it from nobody -- very odd -- i really was persuaded of mrs weston's having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream i am a great dreamer i dream of every body at highbury when i am away -- and when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin dreaming of mr and mrs perry,1,1,0.9777996366631555
emma was pleased with the thought and producing the box the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves they were rapidly forming words for each other or for any body else who would be puzzled the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for mr woodhouse who had often been distressed by the more animated sort which mr weston had occasionally introduced and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting with tender melancholy over the departure of the poor little boys or in fondly pointing out as he took up any stray letter near him how beautifully emma had written it,1,1,0.9660856479484186
frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax she gave a slight glance round the table and applied herself to it frank was next to emma jane opposite to them -- and mr knightley so placed as to see them all and it was his object to see as much as he could with as little apparent observation the word was discovered and with a faint smile pushed away if meant to be immediately mixed with the others and buried from sight she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across for it was not mixed and harriet eager after every fresh word and finding out none directly took it up and fell to work she was sitting by mr knightley and turned to him for help the word was blunder and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it there was a blush on jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible mr knightley connected it with the dream but how it could all be was beyond his comprehension how the delicacy the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep he feared there must be some decided involvement disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick it was a child's play chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank churchill's part,1,1,0.9866306079276748
aye very true my dear cried the latter though jane had not spoken a word -- i was just going to say the same thing it is time for us to be going indeed the evening is closing in and grandmama will be looking for us my dear sir you are too obliging we really must wish you good night,1,1,0.8853297024318532
jane's alertness in moving proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived she was immediately up and wanting to quit the table but so many were also moving that she could not get away and mr knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her and resolutely swept away by her unexamined she was afterwards looking for her shawl -- frank churchill was looking also -- it was growing dusk and the room was in confusion and how they parted mr knightley could not tell,1,1,0.9595750250928774
pray emma said he may i ask in what lay the great amusement the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax i saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other,1,1,0.7934587931476741
have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her or that she admired him,1,1,0.80091880927659
never never she cried with a most open eagerness -- never for the twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me and how could it possibly come into your head,1,1,0.6358620017976739
emma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private,1,1,0.7127177473080025
is not this most vexations knightley she cried -- and such weather for exploring -- these delays and disappointments are quite odious what are we to do -- the year will wear away at this rate and nothing done before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston,1,1,0.9398582743000108
you had better explore to donwell replied mr knightley that may be done without horses come and eat my strawberries they are ripening fast,1,1,0.803162939512965
if mr knightley did not begin seriously he was obliged to proceed so for his proposal was caught at with delight and the oh i should like it of all things was not plainer in words than manner donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds which seemed a plea for the invitation but no plea was necessary cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt the lady who only wanted to be going somewhere she promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it,1,1,0.9758266282249776
i cannot name a day said he till i have spoken to some others whom i would wish to meet you,1,1,0.642594034558186
oh now you are looking very sly but consider -- you need not be afraid of delegating power to me i am no young lady on her preferment married women you know may be safely authorised it is my party leave it all to me i will invite your guests,1,1,0.8430100657533968
that i am sure you would indeed i do you justice my good friend under that peculiar sort of dry blunt manner i know you have the warmest heart as i tell mr e you are a thorough humourist -- yes believe me knightley i am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme you have hit upon the very thing to please me,1,1,0.8315211115478296
mr knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade he wished to persuade mr woodhouse as well as emma to join the party and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill mr woodhouse must not under the specious pretence of a morning drive and an hour or two spent at donwell be tempted away to his misery,1,1,0.9858146902376462
mr knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence the invitation was everywhere so well received that it seemed as if like mrs elton they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves -- emma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it and mr weston unasked promised to get frank over to join them if possible a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with -- mr knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him and mr weston engaged to lose no time in writing and spare no arguments to induce him to come,1,1,0.9988146923841994
in this walk emma and mr weston found all the others assembled and towards this view she immediately perceived mr knightley and harriet distinct from the rest quietly leading the way mr knightley and harriet -- it was an odd tete-a-tete but she was glad to see it -- there had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion and turned from her with little ceremony now they seemed in pleasant conversation there had been a time also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the abbey mill farm but now she feared it not it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty its rich pastures spreading flocks orchard in blossom and light column of smoke ascending -- she joined them at the wall and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc and emma received a smile which seemed to say these are my own concerns i have a right to talk on such subjects without being suspected of introducing robert martin -- she did not suspect him it was too old a story -- robert martin had probably ceased to think of harriet -- they took a few turns together along the walk -- the shade was most refreshing and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day,1,1,0.9952427103898166
the cold repast was over and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen the old abbey fish-ponds perhaps get as far as the clover which was to be begun cutting on the morrow or at any rate have the pleasure of being hot and growing cool again -- mr woodhouse who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens where no damps from the river were imagined even by him stirred no more and his daughter resolved to remain with him that mrs weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need,1,1,0.9098667939001661
yes -- what should hurt me -- i walk fast i shall be at home in twenty minutes,1,1,0.5106376980120602
you will soon be cooler if you sit still said emma,1,1,0.7683288407851445
as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again i could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming you will all be going soon i suppose the whole party breaking up i met one as i came -- madness in such weather -- absolute madness,1,1,0.817543266108943
you are not quite so miserable though as when you first came go and eat and drink a little more and you will do very well another slice of cold meat another draught of madeira and water will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us,1,0,0.3385948931974836
no -- i shall not stir i shall sit by you you are my best cure,1,0,0.3983308328498717
no certainly not i shall go home in the cool of the evening,1,1,0.5219237527216578
these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself chuse your own degree of crossness i shall press you no more,1,1,0.7950138779877732
the rest of the party were now returning and all were soon collected with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill others took it very composedly but there was a very general distress and disturbance on miss fairfax's disappearance being explained that it was time for every body to go concluded the subject and with a short final arrangement for the next day's scheme they parted frank churchill's little inclination to exclude himself increased so much that his last words to emma were,1,1,0.9856950735849456
well -- if you wish me to stay and join the party i will,1,1,0.7297274752027275
she smiled her acceptance and nothing less than a summons from richmond was to take him back before the following evening,1,1,0.6103155792593123
is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of,1,1,0.9004341329173646
it will not do whispered frank to emma they are most of them affronted i will attack them with more address ladies and gentlemen -- i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of and only requires something very entertaining from each of you in a general way here are seven of you besides myself who she is pleased to say am very entertaining already and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever be it prose or verse original or repeated -- or two things moderately clever -- or three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily at them all,1,1,0.8724550981973308
ah ma'am but there may be a difficulty pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once,1,1,0.6509596243819674
miss bates deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner did not immediately catch her meaning but when it burst on her it could not anger though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her,1,1,0.9275431780538934
yes yes pray pass me added her husband with a sort of sneering consciousness i have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse or any other young lady an old married man -- quite good for nothing shall we walk augusta,1,1,0.8756850638186856
they walked off followed in half a minute by mr knightley mr weston his son emma and harriet only remained and the young man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant even emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others or sitting almost alone and quite unattended to in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her the appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart and the solicitude of mrs elton to have her carriage first were gladly endured in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure such another scheme composed of so many ill-assorted people she hoped never to be betrayed into again,1,1,0.9867550904793845
emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still use it i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation -- emma i had not thought it possible,1,1,0.9800426465026028
i assure you she did she felt your full meaning she has talked of it since i wish you could have heard how she talked of it -- with what candour and generosity i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome,1,1,0.9701116740603207
oh cried emma i know there is not a better creature in the world but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her,1,1,0.7990141215441827
she was just as determined when the morrow came and went early that nothing might prevent her it was not unlikely she thought that she might see mr knightley in her way or perhaps he might come in while she were paying her visit she had no objection she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly and truly hers her eyes were towards donwell as she walked but she saw him not,1,1,0.9826366622244925
there was a bustle on her approach a good deal of moving and talking she heard miss bates's voice something was to be done in a hurry the maid looked frightened and awkward hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment and then ushered her in too soon the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room jane she had a distinct glimpse of looking extremely ill and before the door had shut them out she heard miss bates saying well my dear i shall say you are laid down upon the bed and i am sure you are ill enough,1,1,0.9803354670406881
ah miss woodhouse how kind you are -- i suppose you have heard -- and are come to give us joy this does not seem much like joy indeed in me -- twinkling away a tear or two -- but it will be very trying for us to part with her after having had her so long and she has a dreadful headache just now writing all the morning -- such long letters you know to be written to colonel campbell and mrs dixon my dear ' said i you will blind yourself' -- for tears were in her eyes perpetually one cannot wonder one cannot wonder it is a great change and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation i suppose as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful miss woodhouse for such surprising good fortune -- again dispersing her tears -- but poor dear soul if you were to see what a headache she has when one is in great pain you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve she is as low as possible to look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation you will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room -- i want her to lie down upon the bed my dear ' said i i shall say you are laid down upon the bed ' but however she is not she is walking about the room but now that she has written her letters she says she shall soon be well she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you miss woodhouse but your kindness will excuse her you were kept waiting at the door -- i was quite ashamed -- but somehow there was a little bustle -- for it so happened that we had not heard the knock and till you were on the stairs we did not know any body was coming it is only mrs cole ' said i depend upon it nobody else would come so early ' well ' said she it must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now ' but then patty came in and said it was you oh ' said i it is miss woodhouse i am sure you will like to see her ' -- i can see nobody ' said she and up she got and would go away and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were if you must go my dear ' said i you must and i will say you are laid down upon the bed ',1,1,0.9878650584934137
to a mrs smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort if we except perhaps mrs suckling's own family and mrs bragge's but mrs smallridge is intimate with both and in the very same neighbourhood -- lives only four miles from maple grove jane will be only four miles from maple grove,1,1,0.9927187177743909
miss fairfax i suppose though you were not aware of it had been making up her mind the whole day,1,1,0.9553921308278055
thank you dear miss woodhouse yes indeed there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it except the sucklings and bragges there is not such another nursery establishment so liberal and elegant in all mrs elton's acquaintance mrs smallridge a most delightful woman -- a style of living almost equal to maple grove -- and as to the children except the little sucklings and little bragges there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere jane will be treated with such regard and kindness -- it will be nothing but pleasure a life of pleasure -- and her salary -- i really cannot venture to name her salary to you miss woodhouse even you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane,1,1,0.9959884084689773
ah madam cried emma if other children are at all like what i remember to have been myself i should think five times the amount of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions dearly earned,1,1,0.7382737214208827
yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it it was before tea -- stay -- no it could not be before tea because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea because i remember thinking -- oh no now i recollect now i have it something happened before tea but not that mr elton was called out of the room before tea old john abdy's son wanted to speak with him poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years and now poor old man he is bed-ridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints -- i must go and see him to-day and so will jane i am sure if she gets out at all and poor john's son came to talk to mr elton about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help and so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond that was what happened before tea it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs elton,1,1,0.9886273830445815
now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough and with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt took leave,1,1,0.9897354003535114
emma's pensive meditations as she walked home were not interrupted but on entering the parlour she found those who must rouse her mr knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence and were sitting with her father -- mr knightley immediately got up and in a manner decidedly graver than usual said,1,1,0.9832548054833956
break it to me cried emma standing still with terror -- good god -- mr weston tell me at once -- something has happened in brunswick square i know it has tell me i charge you tell me this moment what it is,1,0,0.4927256130459685
emma found that she must wait and now it required little effort she asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern -- something just come to light of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family -- something which the late event at richmond had brought forward her fancy was very active half a dozen natural children perhaps -- and poor frank cut off -- this though very undesirable would be no matter of agony to her it inspired little more than an animating curiosity,1,1,0.9586572851387073
yes frank came over this morning just to ask us how we did,1,1,0.5872372529071365
mr weston will be almost as much relieved as myself said she on this point we have been wretched it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other -- and we were persuaded that it was so -- imagine what we have been feeling on your account,1,1,0.9324011518291823
he knew nothing about it emma on this article i can fully acquit him it was a private resolution of hers not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction -- till yesterday i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans they burst on him i do not know how but by some letter or message -- and it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project of hers which determined him to come forward at once own it all to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long,1,1,0.9189592229604624
his sufferings replied emma dryly do not appear to have done him much harm well and how did mr churchill take it,1,1,0.941240299592341
this was settled last night and frank was off with the light this morning he stopped at highbury at the bates's i fancy some time -- and then came on hither but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle to whom he is just now more necessary than ever that as i tell you he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour -- he was very much agitated -- very much indeed -- to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen him before -- in addition to all the rest there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion of -- and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal,1,1,0.9724029828480073
and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy -- the campbells the dixons did none of them know of the engagement,1,1,0.7893383819583427
upon my word said emma i begin to doubt my having any such talent can you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i was -- tacitly if not openly -- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings -- i never had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank churchill's having the least regard for jane fairfax you may be very sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly,1,1,0.9951365198247223
him -- never never dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me turning away distressed,1,1,0.9334798443074176
harriet cried emma after a moment's pause -- what do you mean -- good heaven what do you mean -- mistake you -- am i to suppose then --,1,1,0.6610586252257059
you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me at least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been if the other had been the person and now -- it is possible --,1,1,0.8104490710129268
when harriet had closed her evidence she appealed to her dear miss woodhouse to say whether she had not good ground for hope,1,1,0.9479942911736758
mr knightley and harriet smith -- it was a union to distance every wonder of the kind -- the attachment of frank churchill and jane fairfax became commonplace threadbare stale in the comparison exciting no surprize presenting no disparity affording nothing to be said or thought -- mr knightley and harriet smith -- such an elevation on her side such a debasement on his it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion to foresee the smiles the sneers the merriment it would prompt at his expense the mortification and disdain of his brother the thousand inconveniences to himself -- could it be -- no it was impossible and yet it was far very far from impossible -- was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers was it new for one perhaps too busy to seek to be the prize of a girl who would seek him -- was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal inconsistent incongruous -- or for chance and circumstance as second causes to direct the human fate,1,1,0.9911621537078036
how harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to mr knightley -- how she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it -- but harriet was less humble had fewer scruples than formerly -- her inferiority whether of mind or situation seemed little felt -- she had seemed more sensible of mr elton's being to stoop in marrying her than she now seemed of mr knightley's -- alas was not that her own doing too who had been at pains to give harriet notions of self-consequence but herself -- who but herself had taught her that she was to elevate herself if possible and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment -- if harriet from being humble were grown vain it was her doing too,1,1,0.9975856197650413
this point was just arranged when a visitor arrived to tear emma's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them sleeping or waking the last twenty-four hours -- mrs weston who had been calling on her daughter-in-law elect and took hartfield in her way home almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview,1,1,0.9772395857144527
if i did not know her to be happy now said emma seriously which in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must be i could not bear these thanks -- for oh mrs weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfax -- well checking herself and trying to be more lively this is all to be forgotten you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars they shew her to the greatest advantage i am sure she is very good -- i hope she will be very happy it is fit that the fortune should be on his side for i think the merit will be all on hers,1,1,0.9929336684514382
after waiting a moment as if to be sure she intended to say no more he replied,1,1,0.7945770952551869
emma was quite relieved and could presently say with a little more composure,1,1,0.8525890545470445
emma understood him and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure excited by such tender consideration replied,1,1,0.9664451513696694
and i do envy him emma in one respect he is the object of my envy,1,1,0.7203806241503167
my dearest emma said he for dearest you will always be whatever the event of this hour's conversation my dearest most beloved emma -- tell me at once say no ' if it is to be said -- she could really say nothing -- you are silent he cried with great animation absolutely silent at present i ask no more,1,1,0.8946193452889988
seldom very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken but where as in this case though the conduct is mistaken the feelings are not it may not be very material -- mr knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than she possessed or a heart more disposed to accept of his,1,1,0.9364536407571862
she rose early and wrote her letter to harriet an employment which left her so very serious so nearly sad that mr knightley in walking up to hartfield to breakfast did not arrive at all too soon and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him literally and figuratively was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before,1,1,0.9700159422799699
if i made myself intelligible yesterday this letter will be expected but expected or not i know it will be read with candour and indulgence -- you are all goodness and i believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct -- but i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent my courage rises while i write it is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble i have already met with such success in two applications for pardon that i may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence -- you must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when i first arrived at randalls you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards this was the fact my right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment is another question i shall not discuss it here for my temptation to think it a right i refer every caviller to a brick house sashed windows below and casements above in highbury i dared not address her openly my difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well known to require definition and i was fortunate enough to prevail before we parted at weymouth and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement -- had she refused i should have gone mad -- but you will be ready to say what was your hope in doing this -- what did you look forward to -- to any thing every thing -- to time chance circumstance slow effects sudden bursts perseverance and weariness health and sickness every possibility of good was before me and the first of blessings secured in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence if you need farther explanation i have the honour my dear madam of being your husband's son and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of -- see me then under these circumstances arriving on my first visit to randalls -- and here i am conscious of wrong for that visit might have been sooner paid you will look back and see that i did not come till miss fairfax was in highbury and as you were the person slighted you will forgive me instantly but i must work on my father's compassion by reminding him that so long as i absented myself from his house so long i lost the blessing of knowing you my behaviour during the very happy fortnight which i spent with you did not i hope lay me open to reprehension excepting on one point and now i come to the principal the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you which excites my own anxiety or requires very solicitous explanation with the greatest respect and the warmest friendship do i mention miss woodhouse my father perhaps will think i ought to add with the deepest humiliation -- a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to -- my behaviour to miss woodhouse indicated i believe more than it ought -- in order to assist a concealment so essential to me i was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown -- i cannot deny that miss woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but i am sure you will believe the declaration that had i not been convinced of her indifference i would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on -- amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me was as much my conviction as my wish -- she received my attentions with an easy friendly goodhumoured playfulness which exactly suited me we seemed to understand each other from our relative situation those attentions were her due and were felt to be so -- whether miss woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight i cannot say -- when i called to take leave of her i remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth and i then fancied she was not without suspicion but i have no doubt of her having since detected me at least in some degree -- she may not have surmised the whole but her quickness must have penetrated a part i cannot doubt it you will find whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints that it did not take her wholly by surprize she frequently gave me hints of it i remember her telling me at the ball that i owed mrs elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax -- i hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse i could deserve nothing from either acquit me here and procure for me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes of that said emma woodhouse whom i regard with so much brotherly affection as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself -- whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight you have now a key to my heart was in highbury and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be and with the least suspicion if you remember any queernesses set them all to the right account -- of the pianoforte so much talked of i feel it only necessary to say that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f -- who would never have allowed me to send it had any choice been given her -- the delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement my dear madam is much beyond my power of doing justice to you will soon i earnestly hope know her thoroughly yourself -- no description can describe her she must tell you herself what she is -- yet not by word for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit -- since i began this letter which will be longer than i foresaw i have heard from her -- she gives a good account of her own health but as she never complains i dare not depend i want to have your opinion of her looks i know you will soon call on her she is living in dread of the visit perhaps it is paid already let me hear from you without delay i am impatient for a thousand particulars remember how few minutes i was at randalls and in how bewildered how mad a state and i am not much better yet still insane either from happiness or misery when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with of her excellence and patience and my uncle's generosity i am mad with joy but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her and how little i deserve to be forgiven i am mad with anger if i could but see her again -- but i must not propose it yet my uncle has been too good for me to encroach -- i must still add to this long letter you have not heard all that you ought to hear i could not give any connected detail yesterday but the suddenness and in one light the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out needs explanation for though the event of the 26th ult as you will conclude immediately opened to me the happiest prospects i should not have presumed on such early measures but from the very particular circumstances which left me not an hour to lose i should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement -- but i had no choice the hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman -- here my dear madam i was obliged to leave off abruptly to recollect and compose myself -- i have been walking over the country and am now i hope rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be -- it is in fact a most mortifying retrospect for me i behaved shamefully and here i can admit that my manners to miss w in being unpleasant to miss f were highly blameable she disapproved them which ought to have been enough -- my plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient -- she was displeased i thought unreasonably so i thought her on a thousand occasions unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious i thought her even cold but she was always right if i had followed her judgment and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper i should have escaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever known -- we quarrelled -- do you remember the morning spent at donwell -- there every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis i was late i met her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her but she would not suffer it she absolutely refused to allow me which i then thought most unreasonable now however i see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion while i to blind the world to our engagement was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless -- had we been met walking together between donwell and highbury the truth must have been suspected -- i was mad enough however to resent -- i doubted her affection i doubted it more the next day on box hill when provoked by such conduct on my side such shameful insolent neglect of her and such apparent devotion to miss w as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me -- in short my dear madam it was a quarrel blameless on her side abominable on mine and i returned the same evening to richmond though i might have staid with you till the next morning merely because i would be as angry with her as possible even then i was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time but i was the injured person injured by her coldness and i went away determined that she should make the first advances -- i shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party had you witnessed my behaviour there i can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced as soon as she found i was really gone from randalls she closed with the offer of that officious mrs elton the whole system of whose treatment of her by the bye has ever filled me with indignation and hatred i must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself but otherwise i should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known -- jane ' indeed -- you will observe that i have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name even to you think then what i must have endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition and all the insolence of imaginary superiority have patience with me i shall soon have done -- she closed with this offer resolving to break with me entirely and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again -- she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it -- this letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death i answered it within an hour but from the confusion of my mind and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once my answer instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day was locked up in my writing-desk and i trusting that i had written enough though but a few lines to satisfy her remained without any uneasiness -- i was rather disappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily but i made excuses for her and was too busy and -- may i add -- too cheerful in my views to be captious -- we removed to windsor and two days afterwards i received a parcel from her my own letters all returned -- and a few lines at the same time by the post stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last and adding that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible she now sent me by a safe conveyance all my letters and requested that if i could not directly command hers so as to send them to highbury within a week i would forward them after that period to her at -- in short the full direction to mr smallridge's near bristol stared me in the face i knew the name the place i knew all about it and instantly saw what she had been doing it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which i knew her to possess and the secrecy she had maintained as to any such design in her former letter was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy for the world would not she have seemed to threaten me -- imagine the shock imagine how till i had actually detected my own blunder i raved at the blunders of the post -- what was to be done -- one thing only -- i must speak to my uncle without his sanction i could not hope to be listened to again -- i spoke circumstances were in my favour the late event had softened away his pride and he was earlier than i could have anticipated wholly reconciled and complying and could say at last poor man with a deep sigh that he wished i might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done -- i felt that it would be of a different sort -- are you disposed to pity me for what i must have suffered in opening the cause to him for my suspense while all was at stake -- no do not pity me till i reached highbury and saw how ill i had made her do not pity me till i saw her wan sick looks -- i reached highbury at the time of day when from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour i was certain of a good chance of finding her alone -- i was not disappointed and at last i was not disappointed either in the object of my journey a great deal of very reasonable very just displeasure i had to persuade away but it is done we are reconciled dearer much dearer than ever and no moment's uneasiness can ever occur between us again now my dear madam i will release you but i could not conclude before a thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her -- if you think me in a way to be happier than i deserve i am quite of your opinion -- miss w calls me the child of good fortune i hope she is right -- in one respect my good fortune is undoubted that of being able to subscribe myself your obliged and affectionate son f c weston churchill,1,1,0.999720864932831
this letter must make its way to emma's feelings she was obliged in spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do it all the justice that mrs weston foretold as soon as she came to her own name it was irresistible every line relating to herself was interesting and almost every line agreeable and when this charm ceased the subject could still maintain itself by the natural return of her former regard for the writer and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment she never stopt till she had gone through the whole and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to mrs weston and so much in love with miss fairfax and she was so happy herself that there was no being severe and could he have entered the room she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever,1,1,0.9977693122458549
i shall be very glad to look it over said he but it seems long i will take it home with me at night,1,0,0.38850521850466074
i hope he does replied mr knightley coolly and resuming the letter smallridge ' -- what does this mean what is all this,1,1,0.8029263114755886
of their all removing to donwell emma had already had her own passing thoughts like him she had tried the scheme and rejected it but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her she was sensible of all the affection it evinced she felt that in quitting donwell he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits that in living constantly with her father and in no house of his own there would be much very much to be borne with she promised to think of it and advised him to think of it more but he was fully convinced that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject he had given it he could assure her very long and calm consideration he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning to have his thoughts to himself,1,1,0.9899640508945299
ah there is one difficulty unprovided for cried emma i am sure william larkins will not like it you must get his consent before you ask mine,1,1,0.7260074315301208
she had no difficulty in procuring isabella's invitation and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it without resorting to invention -- there was a tooth amiss harriet really wished and had wished some time to consult a dentist mrs john knightley was delighted to be of use any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a mr wingfield she was quite eager to have harriet under her care -- when it was thus settled on her sister's side emma proposed it to her friend and found her very persuadable -- harriet was to go she was invited for at least a fortnight she was to be conveyed in mr woodhouse's carriage -- it was all arranged it was all completed and harriet was safe in brunswick square,1,1,0.9989473133667995
the difference of harriet at mrs goddard's or in london made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emma's sensations but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment which must be averting the past and carrying her out of herself,1,1,0.9789225649858613
soon after this miss bates came in and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting she supposed from doubt of what might be said and impatience to say every thing,1,1,0.9710112206573422
he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from knightley but he and knightley are shut up together in deep consultation -- mr e is knightley's right hand,1,1,0.8429313074583658
oh no it is a meeting at the crown a regular meeting weston and cole will be there too but one is apt to speak only of those who lead -- i fancy mr e and knightley have every thing their own way,1,1,0.9508671221402296
have not you mistaken the day said emma i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to-morrow -- mr knightley was at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday,1,1,0.9658055137091477
i met william larkins continued mr elton as i got near the house and he told me i should not find his master at home but i did not believe him -- william seemed rather out of humour he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him i have nothing to do with william's wants but it really is of very great importance that i should see knightley to-day and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose,1,1,0.8474373303906211
oh you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried emma warmly and taking her hand you owe me no apologies and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied so delighted even --,1,1,0.9073924750405423
pray say no more i feel that all the apologies should be on my side let us forgive each other at once we must do whatever is to be done quickest and i think our feelings will lose no time there i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor,1,1,0.7929104965666739
thank you thank you -- this is just what i wanted to be assured of -- oh if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open -- good-bye good-bye,1,1,0.7679719695801756
that is replied mr knightley she will indulge her even more than she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all it will be the only difference,1,1,0.9153581113910566
john does not even mention your friend said mr knightley here is his answer if you like to see it,1,1,0.8823576042185579
he writes like a sensible man replied emma when she had read the letter i honour his sincerity it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already had he said any thing to bear a different construction i should not have believed him,1,1,0.94300466115172
oh she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret and hear his opinion depend upon it he will be much farther from doing you justice he will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine i wish i may not sink into poor emma' with him at once -- his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther,1,1,0.9420447587929486
the time was coming when the news must spread farther and other persons' reception of it tried as soon as mrs weston was sufficiently recovered to admit mr woodhouse's visits emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause resolved first to announce it at home and then at randalls -- but how to break it to her father at last -- she had bound herself to do it in such an hour of mr knightley's absence or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her and she must have put it off but mr knightley was to come at such a time and follow up the beginning she was to make -- she was forced to speak and to speak cheerfully too she must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him by a melancholy tone herself she must not appear to think it a misfortune -- with all the spirits she could command she prepared him first for something strange and then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which she trusted would be attended with no difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and mr knightley meant to marry by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person's company whom she knew he loved next to his daughters and mrs weston best in the world,1,1,0.9984203405872137
oh good i am sure -- i see it in your countenance you are trying not to smile,1,1,0.5886734642902872
her cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something though she knew not what,1,1,0.710550839033017
emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected his situation is an evil -- but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more his good sense and good principles would delight you -- as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend in better hands his rank in society i would alter if i could which is saying a great deal i assure you emma -- you laugh at me about william larkins but i could quite as ill spare robert martin,1,1,0.9643422996423289
he wanted her to look up and smile and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly -- she did -- cheerfully answering,1,1,0.6528234239681685
emma could not help laughing as she answered upon my word i believe you know her quite as well as i do -- but mr knightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him i could suppose she might in time -- but can she already -- did not you misunderstand him -- you were both talking of other things of business shows of cattle or new drills -- and might not you in the confusion of so many subjects mistake him -- it was not harriet's hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox,1,1,0.9029591511881537
in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father not always listening but always agreeing to what he said and whether in speech or silence conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day or poor mrs weston would be disappointed,1,1,0.9626068862102867
in half a minute they were in the room emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- a number of embarrassing recollections on each side they met readily and smiling but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said and having all sat down again there was for some time such a blank in the circle that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged which she had long felt of seeing frank churchill once more and of seeing him with jane would yield its proportion of pleasure when mr weston joined the party however and when the baby was fetched there was no longer a want of subject or animation -- or of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her and say,1,1,0.9921873219785063
i have to thank you miss woodhouse for a very kind forgiving message in one of mrs weston's letters i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon i hope you do not retract what you then said,1,1,0.9600718269411824
is not she looking well said he turning his eyes towards jane better than she ever used to do -- you see how my father and mrs weston doat upon her,1,1,0.928316078025282
did you ever see such a skin -- such smoothness such delicacy -- and yet without being actually fair -- one cannot call her fair it is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eye-lashes and hair -- a most distinguishing complexion so peculiarly the lady in it -- just colour enough for beauty,1,1,0.7433662765964456
i have always admired her complexion replied emma archly but do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale -- when we first began to talk of her -- have you quite forgotten,1,1,0.837770934029358
oh no -- what an impudent dog i was -- how could i dare --,1,0,0.4749342509361922
very beautiful indeed replied emma and she spoke so kindly that he gratefully burst out,1,1,0.7877991607100447
how delighted i am to see you again and to see you in such excellent looks -- i would not have missed this meeting for the world i should certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come,1,1,0.8846618931079541
the others had been talking of the child mrs weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under the evening before from the infant's appearing not quite well she believed she had been foolish but it had alarmed her and she had been within half a minute of sending for mr perry perhaps she ought to be ashamed but mr weston had been almost as uneasy as herself -- in ten minutes however the child had been perfectly well again this was her history and particularly interesting it was to mr woodhouse who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry and only regretted that she had not done it she should always send for perry if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered were it only for a moment she could not be too soon alarmed nor send for perry too often it was a pity perhaps that he had not come last night for though the child seemed well now very well considering it would probably have been better if perry had seen it,1,1,0.9942428719824483
perry said he to emma and trying as he spoke to catch miss fairfax's eye my friend mr perry what are they saying about mr perry -- has he been here this morning -- and how does he travel now -- has he set up his carriage,1,1,0.9553825708241572
harriet was a little distressed -- did look a little foolish at first but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly and self-deceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words and leave her without a care for the past and with the fullest exultation in the present and future for as to her friend's approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations -- harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at astley's and the dinner the next day she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight but what did such particulars explain -- the fact was as emma could now acknowledge that harriet had always liked robert martin and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible -- beyond this it must ever be unintelligible to emma,1,1,0.9937745481368603
jane fairfax had already quitted highbury and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the campbells -- the mr churchills were also in town and they were only waiting for november,1,1,0.9860799827754593
vanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliot's character vanity of person and of situation he had been remarkably handsome in his youth and at fifty-four was still a very fine man few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society he considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy and the sir walter elliot who united these gifts was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion,1,1,0.9505558695549174
his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own lady elliot had been an excellent woman sensible and amiable whose judgement and conduct if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot had never required indulgence afterwards -- she had humoured or softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years and though not the very happiest being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them -- three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman who had been brought by strong attachment to herself to settle close by her in the village of kellynch and on her kindness and advice lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters,1,1,0.9949786891460916
it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing anne haggard mary coarse every face in the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about lady russell's temples had long been a distress to him,1,1,0.9733513692709944
they must retrench that did not admit of a doubt but she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and elizabeth she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations and she did what nobody else thought of doing she consulted anne who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question she consulted and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to sir walter every emendation of anne's had been on the side of honesty against importance she wanted more vigorous measures a more complete reformation a quicker release from debt a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity,1,1,0.9731322039515016
sir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go was settled and the first outline of this important change made out,1,1,0.8213823489598193
from situation mrs clay was in lady russell's estimate a very unequal and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within miss elliot's reach was therefore an object of first-rate importance,1,1,0.9878668851178275
mr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added --,1,1,0.7018150644564621
i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family-matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying,1,1,0.9686712626156418
they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune said mrs clay for mrs clay was present her father had driven her over nothing being of so much use to mrs clay's health as a drive to kellynch but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected,1,1,0.9688125228046597
indeed was the reply and with a look of surprise,1,1,0.5480885223462454
nay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural effect of time the lawyer plods quite care-worn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman -- she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman -- and even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young,1,1,0.7518983733862488
it seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak sir walter's good will towards a naval officer as tenant had been gifted with foresight for the very first application for the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeed he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make admiral croft was a native of somersetshire who having acquired a very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him that accidentally hearing -- it was just as he had foretold mr shepherd observed sir walter's concerns could not be kept a secret -- accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let and understanding his mr shepherd's connection with the owner he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries and had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel and given mr shepherd in his explicit account of himself every proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant,1,1,0.9935958820889439
mr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very hale hearty well-looking man a little weather-beaten to be sure but not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted a comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible knew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised if sir walter had asked more had inquired about the manor would be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it said he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman,1,1,0.9613981661503638
i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent,1,0,0.49611086581685865
wentworth oh ay -- mr wentworth the curate of monkford you misled me by the term gentleman i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common,1,1,0.9097138443649737
as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them no service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returning with all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea they had formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot an extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in the secret of sir walter's estimate of the dues of a tenant,1,1,0.9867925144417122
sir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough of the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant in all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer so far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing in the admiral's situation in life which was just high enough and not too high i have let my house to admiral croft would sound extremely well very much better than to any mere mr -- a mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs a note of explanation an admiral speaks his own consequence and at the same time can never make a baronet look small in all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must ever have the precedence,1,1,0.9449616639458513
captain wentworth had no fortune he had been lucky in his profession but spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing but he was confident that he should soon be rich full of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted he had always been lucky he knew he should be so still such confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it must have been enough for anne but lady russell saw it very differently his sanguine temper and fearlessness of mind operated very differently on her she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil it only added a dangerous character to himself he was brilliant he was headstrong lady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror she deprecated the connexion in every light,1,1,0.964818883263334
more than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him but she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given in change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture or in any novelty or enlargement of society no one had ever come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth as he stood in her memory no second attachment the only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure at her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind the fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society around them she had been solicited when about two-and-twenty to change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell had lamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man whose landed property and general importance were second in that country only to sir walter's and of good character and appearance and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more while anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father's house and settled so permanently near herself but in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do and though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion never wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for anne's being tempted by some man of talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits,1,1,0.9983163601602433
with these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch and mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness,1,1,0.9769702256708753
this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory and decided the whole business at once each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen there was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality on the admiral's side as could not but influence sir walter who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by mr shepherd's assurances of his being known by report to the admiral as a model of good breeding,1,1,0.976634433748615
something occurred however to give her a different duty mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing that she should not have a day's health all the autumn entreated or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to uppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her instead of going to bath,1,1,0.988115753014016
this invitation of mary's removed all lady russell's difficulties and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath till lady russell took her and that all the intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge,1,1,0.9947002785174917
mrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she is and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people and as to my father i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our sakes need be suspected now if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy but poor mrs clay who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times that tooth of her's and those freckles freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few but he abominates them you must have heard him notice mrs clay's freckles,1,1,0.9895196933352963
i think very differently answered elizabeth shortly an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones however at any rate as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me,1,1,0.8534778512013151
i can give you no account of them i have not seen one of them to-day except mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window but without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was not one of them have been near me it did not happen to suit the miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves out of their way,1,1,0.8726090173651302
my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last and besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner,1,1,0.9843131135202586
did you go then i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party,1,1,0.8424957182796835
i have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves,1,1,0.9699239700667314
as to the management of their children his theory was much better than his wife's and his practice not so bad i could manage them very well if it were not for mary's interference was what anne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in but when listening in turn to mary's reproach of charles spoils the children so that i cannot get them into any order she never had the smallest temptation to say very true,1,1,0.9252385375216129
one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house known to have some influence with her sister she was continually requested or at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill was charles's language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke mary i do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think there was anything the matter with me i am sure anne if you would you might persuade him that i really am very ill -- a great deal worse than i ever own,1,1,0.9939234895840192
mary's declaration was i hate sending the children to the great house though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humours and indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trash and sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with anne to say oh miss anne i cannot help wishing mrs charles had a little of your method with those children they are quite different creatures with you but to be sure in general they are so spoilt it is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them they are as fine healthy children as ever were seen poor little dears without partiality but mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated -- bless me how troublesome they are sometimes i assure you miss anne it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as i otherwise should i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment don't do this and don't do that or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them,1,1,0.9855450244015819
in all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well her own spirits improved by change of place and subject by being removed three miles from kellynch mary's ailments lessened by having a constant companion and their daily intercourse with the other family since there was neither superior affection confidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it was rather an advantage it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible for they met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of mr and mrs musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places or without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters,1,1,0.9951280342564223
the crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were to be visited mary deplored the necessity for herself nobody knew how much she should suffer she should put it off as long as she could but was not easy till she had talked charles into driving her over on an early day and was in a very animated comfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came back anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going she wished however to see the crofts and was glad to be within when the visit was returned they came the master of the house was not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chanced that mrs croft fell to the share of anne while the admiral sat by mary and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys she was well able to watch for a likeness and if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voice or in the turn of sentiment and expression,1,1,0.9962433984289538
it was you and not your sister i find that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country,1,1,0.8810747370760396
she could now answer as she ought and was happy to feel when mrs croft's next words explained it to be mr wentworth of whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother she immediately felt how reasonable it was that mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward and not of frederick and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour's present state with proper interest,1,1,0.9962465679138016
the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day at the cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for when the youngest miss musgrove walked in that she was coming to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves was the first black idea and mary was quite ready to be affronted when louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot to leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage,1,1,0.951012086232041
and i will tell you our reason she added and all about it i am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much of poor richard and we agreed it would be best to have the harp for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte i will tell you why she is out of spirits when the crofts called this morning they called here afterwards did not they they happened to say that her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england or paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly and most unluckily it came into mamma's head when they were gone that wentworth or something very like it was the name of poor richard's captain at one time i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it and of poor richard so we must be as merry as we can that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things,1,1,0.9333079664032347
he had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him by calling him poor richard been nothing better than a thick-headed unfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name living or dead,1,1,0.7139413445827237
to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name so often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it might that it probably would turn out to be the very same captain wentworth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back from clifton -- a very fine young man -- but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to anne's nerves she found however that it was one to which she must inure herself since he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself to be insensible on such points and not only did it appear that he was expected and speedily but the musgroves in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high respect for his character stamped as it was by poor dick's having been six months under his care and mentioning him in strong though not perfectly well-spelt praise as a fine dashing felow only two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on introducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as they could hear of his arrival,1,1,0.9883215140740168
captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove's civility and she was all but calling there in the same half hour she and mary were actually setting forward for the great house where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him when they were stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall the child's situation put the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape with indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account,1,1,0.9844776520874887
husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain mary knew from charles's manner of speaking that he was quite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him she said nothing therefore till he was out of the room but as soon as there was only anne to hear --,1,1,0.9719731194177047
so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening i knew how it would be this is always my luck if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it and charles is as bad as any of them very unfeeling i must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy talks of his being going on so well how does he know that he is going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling so here he is to go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried i am not at all equal to it you saw how hysterical i was yesterday,1,1,0.9023938250859123
but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm -- of the shock you will not be hysterical again i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us i perfectly understand mr robinson's directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province a sick child is always the mother's property her own feelings generally make it so,1,1,0.8976180418436412
the next moment she was tapping at her husband's dressing-room door and as anne followed her up stairs she was in time for the whole conversation which began with mary's saying in a tone of great exultation --,1,1,0.9153715338639362
she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances he must be either indifferent or unwilling had he wished ever to see her again he need not have waited till this time he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting,1,1,0.9594250327490909
mary talked but she could not attend she had seen him they had met they had been once more in the same room,1,1,0.9101831075426392
frederick wentworth had used such words or something like them but without an idea that they would be carried round to her he had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal had spoken as he felt he had not forgiven anne elliot she had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided confident temper could not endure she had given him up to oblige others it had been the effect of over-persuasion it had been weakness and timidity,1,1,0.9832822501182004
yes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish match anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking a little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy and i am a lost man should not this be enough for a sailor who has had no society among women to make him nice,1,1,0.7710092220094535
he said it she knew to be contradicted his bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot was not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with a strong mind with sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description,1,1,0.8268260370604263
that is the woman i want said he something a little inferior i shall of course put up with but it must not be much if i am a fool i shall be a fool indeed for i have thought on the subject more than most men,1,0,0.41034647616054476
from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly in the same circle they were soon dining in company together at mr musgrove's for the little boy's state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings,1,1,0.9874460084672619
from thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper of mrs musgrove's who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying --,1,1,0.9236903644656191
phoo phoo cried the admiral what stuff these young fellows talk never was a better sloop than the asp in her day for an old built sloop you would not see her equal lucky fellow to get her he knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time lucky fellow to get anything so soon with no more interest than his,1,1,0.6880217788355469
but captain wentworth cried louisa how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you,1,1,0.9218185228884933
i knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smiling i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself ah she was a dear old asp to me she did all that i wanted i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition four-and-twenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me anne's shudderings were to herself alone but the miss musgroves could be as open as they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror,1,1,0.911373823607122
her feelings made her speak low and captain wentworth hearing only in part and probably not having dick musgrove at all near his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more,1,1,0.9621448807650677
my brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinking of poor richard,1,1,0.6950757644157787
there was a momentary expression in captain wentworth's face at this speech a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth which convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove's kind wishes as to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her in a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent's feelings,1,1,0.9877210302801204
the admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him being called to order by his wife now came up to captain wentworth and without any observation of what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts began with --,1,1,0.719103984094912
the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry he defended himself though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit which a few hours might comprehend,1,1,0.8856420572722293
nothing to the purpose replied her brother you were living with your husband and were the only woman on board,1,1,0.6586852509268547
but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth where was this superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then,1,1,0.9152410913810007
all merged in my friendship sophia i would assist any brother officer's wife that i could and i would bring anything of harville's from the world's end if he wanted it but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself,1,1,0.7874688496364359
but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days,1,0,0.4484847571822995
ah my dear said the admiral when he had got a wife he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife,1,1,0.5060943629642954
mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life,1,1,0.8859329255625887
and i do assure you ma'am pursued mrs croft that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war i speak you know of the higher rates when you come to a frigate of course you are more confined though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them and i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship while we were together you know there was nothing to be feared thank god i have always been blessed with excellent health and no climate disagrees with me a little disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea but never knew what sickness was afterwards the only time i ever really suffered in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell or had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal when the admiral captain croft then was in the north seas i lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself or when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together nothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenience,1,1,0.9590118635139147
it was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits than captain wentworth she felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference and especially the attention of all the young women could do the miss hayters the females of the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him and as for henrietta and louisa they both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals if he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration who could wonder,1,1,0.9854890899038758
these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her fingers were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together equally without error and without consciousness once she felt that he was looking at herself observing her altered features perhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of her she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced the answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancing she had rather play she is never tired of playing once too he spoke to her she had left the instrument on the dancing being over and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss musgroves an idea of unintentionally she returned to that part of the room he saw her and instantly rising said with studied politeness --,1,1,0.9694502225875996
mrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters they had each had money but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence mr hayter had some property of his own but it was insignificant compared with mr musgrove's and while the musgroves were in the first class of society in the country the young hayters would from their parents' inferior retired and unpolished way of living and their own defective education have been hardly in any class at all but for their connexion with uppercross this eldest son of course excepted who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest,1,1,0.9834913068100486
mr and mrs musgrove either from seeing little or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters and of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything to take its chance there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the mansion-house but it was different at the cottage the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder and captain wentworth had not been above four or five times in the miss musgroves' company and charles hayter had but just reappeared when anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister as to which was the one liked best charles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful,1,1,0.9977443566558728
now you are taking nonsense mary was therefore his answer it would not be a great match for henrietta but charles has a very fair chance through the spicers of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember that he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty property the estate at winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near taunton which is some of the best land in the country i grant you that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta and indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible but he is a very good-natured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthrop comes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it and live in a very different sort of way and with that property he will never be a contemptible man -- good freehold property no no henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has him and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied,1,1,0.9742019061693239
as to captain wentworth's views she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta either of them would in all probability make him an affectionate good-humoured wife with regard to charles hayter she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings the alternation could not be understood too soon,1,1,0.9975999532563629
the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot deprived his manners of their usual composure he started and could only say i thought the miss musgroves had been here mrs musgrove told me i should find them here before he walked to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave,1,1,0.9777187127162789
captain wentworth however came from his window apparently not ill-disposed for conversation but charles hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking up the newspaper and captain wentworth returned to his window,1,1,0.9561269515158662
walter said she get down this moment you are extremely troublesome i am very angry with you,1,1,0.7972472408002053
in another moment however she found herself in the state of being released from him some one was taking him from her though he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away before she knew that captain wentworth had done it,1,1,0.8280691483295696
her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless she could not even thank him she could only hang over little charles with most disordered feelings his kindness in stepping forward to her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed the little particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants produced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitation as she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of mary and the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares and leave the room she could not stay it might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four -- they were now altogether but she could stay for none of it it was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards captain wentworth she had a strong impression of his having said in a vext tone of voice after captain wentworth's interference you ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your aunt and could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself but neither charles hayter's feelings nor anybody's feelings could interest her till she had a little better arranged her own she was ashamed of herself quite ashamed of being so nervous so overcome by such a trifle but so it was and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her,1,1,0.9986717391056916
other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion though too wise to acknowledge as much at home where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife for while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite she could not but think as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience that captain wentworth was not in love with either they were more in love with him yet there it was not love it was a little fever of admiration but it might probably must end in love with some charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to she did not attribute guile to any it was the highest satisfaction to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning there was no triumph no pitiful triumph in his manner he had probably never heard and never thought of any claims of charles hayter he was only wrong in accepting the attentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once,1,1,0.9959215651469289
after a short struggle however charles hayter seemed to quit the field three days had passed without his coming once to uppercross a most decided change he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner and having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books before him mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right and talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death it was mary's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from henrietta and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to-morrow anne could only feel that charles hayter was wise,1,1,0.9952152003796318
ah you make the most of it i know cried louisa but if it were really so i should do just the same in her place if i loved a man as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else,1,1,0.7887263186107084
mary exclaimed bless me here is winthrop i declare i had no idea well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired,1,1,0.8741202757098927
henrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin charles walking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready to do as mary wished but no said charles musgrove and no no cried louisa more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to be arguing the matter warmly,1,1,0.9744099954297384
after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations it was settled between charles and his two sisters that he and henrietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their aunt and cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan and as she went a little way with them down the hill still talking to henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her and saying to captain wentworth --,1,1,0.9019469509335479
the brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot louisa returned and mary finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her but when louisa drew captain wentworth away to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound mary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seat was sure louisa had got a much better somewhere and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also she turned through the same gate but could not see them anne found a nice seat for her on a dry sunny bank under the hedge-row in which she had no doubt of their still being in some spot or other mary sat down for a moment but it would not do she was sure louisa had found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on till she overtook her,1,1,0.9044165176813141
well and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we to wait for besides i do not like having such things so long in hand i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home one of these young ladies to kellynch then there would always be company for them and very nice young ladies they both are i hardly know one from the other,1,1,0.865140854741763
the young people were all wild to see lyme captain wentworth talked of going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from uppercross though november the weather was by no means bad and in short louisa who was the most eager of the eager having formed the resolution to go and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer and to lyme they were to go -- charles mary anne henrietta louisa and captain wentworth,1,1,0.9958424159677766
they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring and not even louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long when they saw him coming after them with three companions all well known already by description to be captain and mrs harville and a captain benwick who was staying with them,1,1,0.9783516563376402
captain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia and the account which captain wentworth had given of him on his return from lyme before his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener had been followed by a little history of his private life which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies he had been engaged to captain harville's sister and was now mourning her loss they had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion fortune came his prize-money as lieutenant being great promotion too came at last but fanny harville did not live to know it she had died the preceding summer while he was at sea captain wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor benwick had been to fanny harville or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change he considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings with quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading and sedentary pursuits to finish the interest of the story the friendship between him and the harvilles seemed if possible augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance and captain benwick was now living with them entirely captain harville had taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health and his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive and by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement of lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick's state of mind the sympathy and good-will excited towards captain benwick was very great,1,1,0.9970065329749214
the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening and he came bringing his friend also which was more than had been expected it having been agreed that captain benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers he ventured among them again however though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general,1,1,0.9751149940743181
while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room and by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others it fell to anne's lot to be placed rather apart with captain benwick and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him he was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect and anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading though principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening's indulgence in the discussion of subjects which his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out of their conversation for though shy he did not seem reserved it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets trying to ascertain whether marmion or the lady of the lake were to be preferred and how ranked the giaour and the bride of abydos and moreover how the giaour was to be pronounced he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines which imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry and to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly,1,1,0.9869544019012833
captain benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful for the interest implied and though with a shake of the head and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended and promised to procure and read them,1,1,0.8481020834831665
anne and henrietta finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast they went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tide which a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted they praised the morning gloried in the sea sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling breeze -- and were silent till henrietta suddenly began again with --,1,0,0.4753157391508844
the miss musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table the waiter came into the room soon afterwards,1,1,0.8713691960575156
pray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away,1,1,0.7145594903665681
not till the first week of august when he came home from the cape just made into the grappler i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him he sent in letters but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth there the news must follow him but who was to tell it not i i would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm nobody could do it but that good fellow pointing to captain wentworth the laconia had come into plymouth the week before no danger of her being sent to sea again he stood his chance for the rest wrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth rowed off to the grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week that's what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james you may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us,1,1,0.8179926325116218
mrs harville's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk they would accompany them to their door and then return and set off themselves by all their calculations there was just time for this but as they drew near the cobb there was such a general wish to walk along it once more all were so inclined and louisa soon grew so determined that the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found would be no difference at all so with all the kind leave-taking and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined they parted from captain and mrs harville at their own door and still accompanied by captain benwick who seemed to cling to them to the last proceeded to make the proper adieus to the cobb,1,1,0.9873221418890618
captain benwick obeyed and charles at the same moment disengaging himself from his wife they were both with him and louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them and everything was done that anne had prompted but in vain while captain wentworth staggering against the wall for his support exclaimed in the bitterest agony --,1,1,0.9279609307367165
captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick he knows where a surgeon is to be found,1,1,0.9146370119817466
anne anne cried charles what is to be done next what in heaven's name is to be done next,1,1,0.8744671201755314
louisa's limbs had escaped there was no injury but to the head,1,1,0.622773837081354
charles henrietta and captain wentworth were the three in consultation and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror uppercross the necessity of some one's going to uppercross the news to be conveyed how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove the lateness of the morning an hour already gone since they ought to have been off the impossibility of being in tolerable time at first they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations but after a while captain wentworth exerting himself said --,1,1,0.9904694433328683
we must be decided and without the loss of another minute every minute is valuable some one must resolve on being off for uppercross instantly musgrove either you or i must go,1,1,0.9008434612178757
captain benwick was most considerately attentive to her and united as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt an increasing degree of good-will towards him and a pleasure even in thinking that it might perhaps be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance,1,1,0.9824864394027092
the remainder of anne's time at uppercross comprehending only two days was spent entirely at the mansion house and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there both as an immediate companion and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future which in mr and mrs musgrove's distressed state of spirits would have been difficulties,1,1,0.9930678381107529
anne did not shrink from it on the contrary she truly felt as she said in observing --,1,1,0.9042691023245951
we have made very few changes either continued the admiral after thinking a moment very few we told you about the laundry-door at uppercross that has been a very great improvement the wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did so long you will tell sir walter what we have done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had indeed i must do ourselves the justice to say that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better my wife should have the credit of them however i have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my dressing-room which was your father's a very good man and very much the gentleman i am sure but i should think miss elliot looking with serious reflection i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life such a number of looking-glasses oh lord there was no getting away from one's self so i got sophy to lend me a hand and we soon shifted their quarters and now i am quite snug with my little shaving glass in one corner and another great thing that i never go near,1,1,0.9128364369895693
so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall or of seeing him in company with her friend everything was safe enough and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject,1,1,0.981913397199054
mary had had her evils but upon the whole as was evident by her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her and when they dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait and at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence but then she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was and there had been so much going on every day there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the harvilles and she had got books from the library and changed them so often that the balance had certainly been much in favour of lyme she had been taken to charmouth too and she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross and all this joined to the sense of being so very useful had made really an agreeable fortnight,1,1,0.9932897350387999
and i am sure cried mary warmly it was a very little to his credit if he did miss harville only died last june such a heart is very little worth having is it lady russell i am sure you will agree with me,1,1,0.9760463102976674
so do i anne said charles i am sure lady russell would like him he is just lady russell's sort give him a book and he will read all day long,1,1,0.9367408551062977
louisa was now recovering apace her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home before her brothers and sisters went to school again the harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at uppercross whenever she returned captain wentworth was gone for the present to see his brother in shropshire,1,1,0.9851346539783288
everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters and sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sort rather than their quantity when lady russell not long afterwards was entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through the long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place amidst the dash of other carriages the heavy rumble of carts and drays the bawling of newspapermen muffin-men and milkmen and the ceaseless clink of pattens she made no complaint no these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures her spirits rose under their influence and like mrs musgrove she was feeling though not saying that after being long in the country nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness,1,1,0.801858684540671
anne did not share these feelings she persisted in a very determined though very silent disinclination for bath caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish of seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be however disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her when she arrived and looked back with fond regret to the bustles of uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch,1,1,0.9732103974893739
anne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprisonment of many months and anxiously saying to herself oh when shall i leave you again a degree of unexpected cordiality however in the welcome she received did her good her father and sister were glad to see her for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture and met her with kindness her making a fourth when they sat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage,1,1,0.9733490658732268
how is mary looking said sir walter in the height of his good humour the last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not happen every day,1,1,0.6164273306693367
there was one point which anne on returning to her family would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot's being in love with elizabeth which was her father's not being in love with mrs clay and she was very far from easy about it when she had been at home a few hours on going down to breakfast the next morning she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady's side of meaning to leave them she could imagine mrs clay to have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself at all wanted for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper that must not be any reason indeed i assure you i feel it none she is nothing to me compared with you and she was in full time to hear her father say my dear madam this must not be as yet you have seen nothing of bath you have been here only to be useful you must not run away from us now you must stay to be acquainted with mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis to your fine mind i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification,1,1,0.9970433517622418
lady russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point in her intercourse in camden place the sight of mrs clay in such favour and of anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation to her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in bath who drinks the water gets all the new publications and has a very large acquaintance has time to be vexed,1,1,0.9639730113450121
as mr elliot became known to her she grew more charitable or more indifferent towards the others his manners were an immediate recommendation and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial that she was at first as she told anne almost ready to exclaim can this be mr elliot and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man everything united in him good understanding correct opinions knowledge of the world and a warm heart he had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour without pride or weakness he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune without display he judged for himself in everything essential without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum he was steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirits or by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling and yet with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely and a value for all the felicities of domestic life which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess she was sure that he had not been happy in marriage colonel wallis said it and lady russell saw it but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind nor she began pretty soon to suspect to prevent his thinking of a second choice her satisfaction in mr elliot outweighed all the plague of mrs clay,1,1,0.9968446135101052
they did not always think alike his value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers it was not merely complaisance it must be a liking to the cause which made him enter warmly into her father and sister's solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them the bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple and her daughter the honourable miss carteret and all the comfort of no -- camden place was swept away for many days for the dalrymples in anne's opinion most unfortunately were cousins of the elliots and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly,1,1,0.9899564142259732
sir walter had once been in company with the late viscount but had never seen any of the rest of the family and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter's at the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland the neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner for when poor lady elliot died herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynch and consequently there was but too much reason to apprehend that the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed how to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted as cousins again was the question and it was a question which in a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliot thought unimportant family connexions were always worth preserving good company always worth seeking lady dalrymple had taken a house for three months in laura place and would be living in style she had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman it was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any compromise of propriety on the side of the elliots,1,1,0.9971642511953813
sir walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreaty to his right honourable cousin neither lady russell nor mr elliot could admire the letter but it did all that was wanted in bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess she was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance the toils of the business were over the sweets began they visited in laura place they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple and the honourable miss carteret to be arranged wherever they might be most visible and our cousins in laura place -- our cousin lady dalrymple and miss carteret were talked of to everybody,1,1,0.98696791305066
lady russell confessed she had expected something better but yet it was an acquaintance worth having and when anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to mr elliot he agreed to their being nothing in themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion as good company as those who would collect good company around them they had their value anne smiled and said,1,1,0.9924504127493886
she had called on her former governess and had heard from her of there being an old school-fellow in bath who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering miss hamilton now mrs smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable anne had gone unhappy to school grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved feeling her separation from home and suffering as a girl of fourteen of strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time and miss hamilton three years older than herself but still from the want of near relations and a settled home remaining another year at school had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery and could never be remembered with indifference,1,1,0.9938642201916625
miss hamilton had left school had married not long afterwards was said to have married a man of fortune and this was all that anne had known of her till now that their governess's account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form,1,1,0.9729548040399382
she was a widow and poor her husband had been extravagant and at his death about two years before had left his affairs dreadfully involved she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs had made her for the present a cripple she had come to bath on that account and was now in lodgings near the hot baths living in a very humble way unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society,1,1,0.9440920271177017
anne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation neither the dissipations of the past -- and she had lived very much in the world -- nor the restrictions of the present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits,1,1,0.9776196629027611
anne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied i can easily believe it women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested self-denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes,1,1,0.8267493172186192
yes said mrs smith more doubtingly sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe here and there human nature may be great in times of trial but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately speaking low and tremulously there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late,1,1,0.7191979107091709
i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present will furnish much either to interest or edify me she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all the high-priced things i have in hand now,1,1,0.8751094376330231
she sees nothing to blame in it replied anne on the contrary she approves it and has generally taken me when i have called on mrs smith,1,1,0.9436497522125438
i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft's time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this,1,1,0.88276952769449
in her own room she tried to comprehend it well might charles wonder how captain wentworth would feel perhaps he had quitted the field had given louisa up had ceased to love had found he did not love her she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend she could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly,1,1,0.9743695820954953
she saw no reason against their being happy louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alike he would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast for scott and lord byron nay that was probably learnt already of course they had fallen in love over poetry the idea of louisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste and sentimental reflection was amusing but she had no doubt of its being so the day at lyme the fall from the cobb might influence her health her nerves her courage her character to the end of her life as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate,1,1,0.9486850591104988
did you say that you had something to tell me sir,1,0,0.3842044702829009
well now you shall hear something that will surprise you but first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady i am going to talk about that young lady you know that we have all been so concerned for the miss musgrove that all this has been happening to her christian name i always forget her christian name,1,1,0.7466721967217548
oh yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick he is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are bad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of an excellent good-hearted fellow i assure you a very active zealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice,1,1,0.7541297296250186
indeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit from captain benwick's manners i thought them particularly pleasing and i will answer for it they would generally please,1,1,0.9386011759641926
while admiral croft was taking this walk with anne and expressing his wish of getting captain wentworth to bath captain wentworth was already on his way thither before mrs croft had written he was arrived and the very next time anne walked out she saw him,1,1,0.9899441631300808
her start was perceptible only to herself but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable and absurd for a few minutes she saw nothing before her it was all confusion she was lost and when she had scolded back her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriage and mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union street on a commission of mrs clay's,1,1,0.9529466066469146
she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door she wanted to see if it rained why was she to suspect herself of another motive captain wentworth must be out of sight she left her seat she would go one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was she would see if it rained she was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of captain wentworth himself among a party of gentlemen and ladies evidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined a little below milsom street he was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before he looked quite red for the first time since their renewed acquaintance she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two she had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments all the overpowering blinding bewildering first effects of strong surprise were over with her still however she had enough to feel it was agitation pain pleasure a something between delight and misery,1,1,0.9837493549960286
i am much obliged to you was her answer but i am not going with them the carriage would not accommodate so many i walk i prefer walking,1,1,0.8617120922690851
she was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating her conviction that the rain would come to nothing at present and adding i am only waiting for mr elliot he will be here in a moment i am sure,1,1,0.9524718273235295
she had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in captain wentworth recollected him perfectly there was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme admiring anne as she passed except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend he came in with eagerness appeared to see and think only of her apologised for his stay was grieved to have kept her waiting and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased and in another moment they walked off together her arm under his a gentle and embarrassed glance and a good morning to you being all that she had time for as she passed away,1,1,0.9774908947467702
she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove was to marry captain benwick it had cost her something to encounter lady russell's surprise and now if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with captain wentworth her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him,1,1,0.9909794885762586
you will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long but i was looking after some window-curtains which lady alicia and mrs frankland were telling me of last night they described the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest and best hung of any in bath but could not recollect the exact number and i have been trying to find out which it could be but i confess i can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description,1,1,0.8238485121301967
i should very much like to see lyme again said anne,1,1,0.9166126101426186
indeed i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling the horror and distress you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust,1,1,0.8858760034193743
the last hours were certainly very painful replied anne but when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure one does not love a place the less for having suffered in it unless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was by no means the case at lyme we were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment so much novelty and beauty i have travelled so little that every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beauty at lyme and in short with a faint blush at some recollections altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable,1,1,0.9830953739624098
the delightful emotions were a little subdued when on stepping back from the group to be joined again by captain wentworth she saw that he was gone she was just in time to see him turn into the concert room he was gone he had disappeared she felt a moment's regret but they should meet again he would look for her he would find her out before the evening were over and at present perhaps it was as well to be asunder she was in need of a little interval for recollection,1,1,0.92101763888209
very very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in elizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret and looking on the broad back of the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach and anne -- but it would be an insult to the nature of anne's felicity to draw any comparison between it and her sister's the origin of one all selfish vanity of the other all generous attachment,1,1,0.9863821664323927
indeed how so you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family,1,1,0.9454574114002475
i knew you by report long before you came to bath i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately i have been acquainted with you by character many years your person your disposition accomplishments manner they were all present to me,1,1,0.8865104173342928
anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford captain wentworth's brother he might have been in mr elliot's company but she had not courage to ask the question,1,1,0.9925874541684911
no i just know his name a bowing acquaintance wentworth captain wentworth of the navy his sister married my tenant in somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch,1,1,0.9872754989860314
mr elliot's speech too distressed her she had no longer any inclination to talk to him she wished him not so near her,1,1,0.9811634156776153
a few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed and when her own mistress again when able to turn and look as she had done before she found herself accosted by captain wentworth in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell he must wish her good night he was going he should get home as fast as he could,1,1,0.9233535530582031
yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were in the room,1,1,0.8363920917257103
no that was what i dreaded it would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect but happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen very little,1,1,0.9547974245504305
yes i do your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together,1,1,0.6498921125688196
a blush overspread anne's cheeks she could say nothing,1,1,0.8900128871946128
anne heard nothing of this she was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend's penetration unable to imagine how any report of captain wentworth could have reached her after another short silence --,1,1,0.97689737952449
no was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid i observed no one in particular,1,1,0.7980557859158224
but continued anne presently though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could shall i mention to him your being in bath shall i take any message,1,1,0.9785206903464944
anne's astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause and in a calmer manner she added,1,1,0.8512905342821862
this must have been about that very period of mr elliot's life said anne which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed to announce a different sort of man,1,1,0.9672846540707748
yes which i objected to but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was a grazier her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot's company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof,1,1,0.97842184094695
thank you this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying but why be acquainted with us now,1,1,0.8128419311250071
yes i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago and i will shew him as he is now i cannot produce written proof again but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what he is now wanting and what he is now doing he is no hypocrite now he truly wants to marry you his present attentions to your family are very sincere quite from the heart i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis,1,1,0.9063734571483183
no it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence the stream is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all to me on monday evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed,1,1,0.9654117091800137
anne went home to think over all that she had heard in one point her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him he stood as opposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness and the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed pity for him was all over but this was the only point of relief in every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward she saw more to distrust and to apprehend she was concerned for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing how to avert any one of them she was most thankful for her own knowledge of him she had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here was a reward indeed springing from it mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done could the knowledge have been extended through her family but this was a vain idea she must talk to lady russell tell her consult with her and having done her best wait the event with as much composure as possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself,1,1,0.9980423541076484
she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side it was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace as quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along she was accordingly more guarded and more cool than she had been the night before,1,1,0.9202820507663662
he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin's vanity he found at least that it was not to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too-commanding claims of the others he little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable,1,1,0.945515964770589
on friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell and accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone directly after breakfast but that mrs clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion she saw mrs clay fairly off therefore before she began to talk of spending the morning in rivers street,1,1,0.9810287694099284
anne could not help laughing that cannot be much to your taste i know said she but i do believe him to be an excellent young man,1,1,0.8725711893442931
elizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal she felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style the reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch it was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better and then elizabeth was happy again these were her internal persuasions old fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess to give dinners few people in bath do lady alicia never does did not even ask her own sister's family though they were here a month and i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove put her quite out of her way i am sure she would rather not come she cannot feel easy with us i will ask them all for an evening that will be much better that will be a novelty and a treat they have not seen two such drawing rooms before they will be delighted to come to-morrow evening it shall be a regular party small but most elegant and this satisfied elizabeth and when the invitation was given to the two present and promised for the absent mary was as completely satisfied she was particularly asked to meet mr elliot and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret who were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not have received a more gratifying attention miss elliot was to have the honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning and anne walked off with charles and mary to go and see her and henrietta directly,1,1,0.9996114556322869
they found mrs musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves and anne had the kindest welcome from each henrietta was exactly in that state of recently-improved views of fresh-formed happiness which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all and mrs musgrove's real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress it was a heartiness and a warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more from the sad want of such blessings at home she was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day and all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance and on charles's leaving them together was listening to mrs musgrove's history of louisa and to henrietta's of herself giving opinions on business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help which mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts from finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody which mary well amused as she generally was in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the pump room could not but have her moments of imagining,1,1,0.9977073460652481
a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected a large party in an hotel ensured a quick-changing unsettled scene one five minutes brought a note the next a parcel and anne had not been there half an hour when their dining-room spacious as it was seemed more than half filled a party of steady old friends were seated around mrs musgrove and charles came back with captains harville and wentworth the appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment it was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings she had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared from his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had hastened him away from the concert room still governed he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation,1,1,0.9913531098101147
she tried to be calm and leave things to take their course and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence -- surely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts must understand each other ere long we are not boy and girl to be captiously irritable misled by every moment's inadvertence and wantonly playing with our own happiness and yet a few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company with each other under their present circumstances could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind,1,1,0.7392701308066276
as she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret that she had said so much simple as it was,1,1,0.9572905267808839
the visitors took their leave and charles having civilly seen them off and then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with --,1,1,0.6432882688988999
good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing take a box for to-morrow night have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place to-morrow night and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them how can you be so forgetful,1,1,0.9378866476654062
i am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction after waiting a few moments he said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling it is a period indeed eight years and a half is a period,1,1,0.8864123905259119
whether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne's imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered she was startled to other subjects by henrietta eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out and calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else should come in,1,1,0.9039679321569941
oh dear very true only think miss elliot to my great surprise i met with mr elliot in bath street i was never more astonished he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard he had been prevented setting off for thornberry but i really forget by what for i was in a hurry and could not much attend and i can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return he wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow he was full of to-morrow ' and it is very evident that i have been full of it too ever since i entered the house and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head,1,1,0.9784950757594452
anne found an unexpected interest here she felt its application to herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table captain wentworth's pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing listening and he turned round the next instant to give a look one quick conscious look at her,1,1,0.7631286283187896
your feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health nor life to be called your own it would be hard indeed with a faltering voice if woman's feelings were to be added to all this,1,1,0.8445004122047849
we shall never agree upon this question captain harville was beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention to captain wentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room it was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think he could have caught,1,1,0.9468197437051182
oh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you and by those who resemble you god forbid that i should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman no i believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives i believe you equal to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance so long as -- if i may be allowed the expression -- so long as you have an object i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone,1,1,0.899189942787877
their attention was called towards the others mrs croft was taking leave,1,1,0.9329424697483613
here frederick you and i part company i believe said she i am going home and you have an engagement with your friend to-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party turning to anne we had your sister's card yesterday and i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it and you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves,1,1,0.9336692033090336
such a letter was not to be soon recovered from half and hour's solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted with all the restraints of her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity every moment rather brought fresh agitation it was overpowering happiness and before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation charles mary and henrietta all came in,1,1,0.9846628311814306
captain wentworth which way are you going only to gay street or farther up the town,1,1,0.8271683021279863
he found too late in short that he had entangled himself and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for louisa at all he must regard himself as bound to her if her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed it determined him to leave lyme and await her complete recovery elsewhere he would gladly weaken by any fair means whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist and he went therefore to his brother's meaning after a while to return to kellynch and act as circumstances might require,1,1,0.9684362670811498
the evening came the drawing-rooms were lighted up the company assembled it was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had never met before and those who met too often a commonplace business too numerous for intimacy too small for variety but anne had never found an evening shorter glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her mr elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him the wallises she had amusement in understanding them lady dalrymple and miss carteret -- they would soon be innoxious cousins to her she cared not for mrs clay and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister with the musgroves there was the happy chat of perfect ease with captain harville the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister with lady russell attempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short with admiral and mrs croft everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal and with captain wentworth some moments of communications continually occurring and always the hope of more and always the knowledge of his being there,1,1,0.9985598365603892
there is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment of character a natural penetration in short which no experience in others can equal and lady russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend but she was a very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible and well-judging her first was to see anne happy she loved anne better than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child,1,1,0.9899715783346976
it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation for a change is not very probable there she had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him,1,1,0.9828599591304202
her recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves and their marriage instead of depriving her of one friend secured her two she was their earliest visitor in their settled life and captain wentworth by putting her in the way of recovering her husband's property in the west indies by writing for her acting for her and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend fully requited the services which she had rendered or ever meant to render to his wife,1,1,0.9782455021012527
mrs smith's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income with some improvement of health and the acquisition of such friends to be often with for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her and while these prime supplies of good remained she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity she might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy and yet be happy her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits as her friend anne's was in the warmth of her heart anne was tenderness itself and she had the full worth of it in captain wentworth's affection his profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine she gloried in being a sailor's wife but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is if possible more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance,1,1,0.9887065214411789
when he gave his promise to his father he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a-piece he then really thought himself equal to it the prospect of four thousand a-year in addition to his present income besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune warmed his heart and made him feel capable of generosity -- yes he would give them three thousand pounds it would be liberal and handsome it would be enough to make them completely easy three thousand pounds he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience -- he thought of it all day long and for many days successively and he did not repent,1,1,0.9379761423893661
no sooner was his father's funeral over than mrs john dashwood without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law arrived with her child and their attendants no one could dispute her right to come the house was her husband's from the moment of his father's decease but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater and to a woman in mrs dashwood's situation with only common feelings must have been highly unpleasing -- but in her mind there was a sense of honor so keen a generosity so romantic that any offence of the kind by whomsoever given or received was to her a source of immoveable disgust mrs john dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband's family but she had had no opportunity till the present of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it,1,1,0.9945029106539007
marianne's abilities were in many respects quite equal to elinor's she was sensible and clever but eager in everything her sorrows her joys could have no moderation she was generous amiable interesting she was everything but prudent the resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great,1,1,0.9767116863550821
margaret the other sister was a good-humored well-disposed girl but as she had already imbibed a good deal of marianne's romance without having much of her sense she did not at thirteen bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life,1,1,0.9581717364622421
it was my father's last request to me replied her husband that i should assist his widow and daughters,1,1,0.8010435687281128
certainly -- and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds a-piece as it is without any addition of mine they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother's death -- a very comfortable fortune for any young woman,1,1,0.8158160988205752
that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives rather than for them -- something of the annuity kind i mean -- my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable,1,1,0.853471825713897
to be sure it will indeed to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they are in season i'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did do but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece and of course they will pay their mother for their board out of it altogether they will have five hundred a-year amongst them and what on earth can four women want for more than that -- they will live so cheap their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants they will keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind only conceive how comfortable they will be five hundred a year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it they will be much more able to give you something,1,1,0.9441056942552715
yes and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house a great deal too handsome in my opinion for any place they can ever afford to live in but however so it is your father thought only of them and i must say this that you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes for we very well know that if he could he would have left almost everything in the world to them,1,1,0.8786677902635379
some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest for edward ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence for except a trifling sum the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother but mrs dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration it was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable that he loved her daughter and that elinor returned the partiality it was contrary to every doctrine of her's that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition and that elinor's merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her was to her comprehension impossible,1,1,0.9957517576614481
mrs dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him her manners were attaching and soon banished his reserve she speedily comprehended all his merits the persuasion of his regard for elinor perhaps assisted her penetration but she really felt assured of his worth and even that quietness of manner which militated against all her established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate,1,1,0.9945112366536633
my love it will be scarcely a separation we shall live within a few miles of each other and shall meet every day of our lives you will gain a brother a real affectionate brother i have the highest opinion in the world of edward's heart but you look grave marianne do you disapprove your sister's choice,1,1,0.84830352132436
he would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose i thought so at the time but you would give him cowper,1,1,0.7326506510078645
nay mamma if he is not to be animated by cowper -- but we must allow for difference of taste elinor has not my feelings and therefore she may overlook it and be happy with him but it would have broke my heart had i loved him to hear him read with so little sensibility mama the more i know of the world the more am i convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can really love i require so much he must have all edward's virtues and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm,1,1,0.9770900286405513
what a pity it is elinor said marianne that edward should have no taste for drawing,1,1,0.9855898800937937
no taste for drawing replied elinor why should you think so he does not draw himself indeed but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people and i assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste though he has not had opportunities of improving it had he ever been in the way of learning i think he would have drawn very well he distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste which in general direct him perfectly right,1,1,0.9747235893258602
i hope marianne continued elinor you do not consider him as deficient in general taste indeed i think i may say that you cannot for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial and if that were your opinion i am sure you could never be civil to him,1,1,0.9889311744594803
elinor had given her real opinion to her sister she could not consider her partiality for edward in so prosperous a state as marianne had believed it there was at times a want of spirits about him which if it did not denote indifference spoke of something almost as unpromising a doubt of her regard supposing him to feel it need not give him more than inquietude it would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him a more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection she knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement with such a knowledge as this it was impossible for elinor to feel easy on the subject she was far from depending on that result of his preference of her which her mother and sister still considered as certain nay the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard and sometimes for a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more than friendship,1,1,0.998104862120644
in this state of her spirits a letter was delivered to her from the post which contained a proposal particularly well timed it was the offer of a small house on very easy terms belonging to a relation of her own a gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire the letter was from this gentleman himself and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation he understood that she was in need of a dwelling and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary if the situation pleased her he earnestly pressed her after giving the particulars of the house and garden to come with her daughters to barton park the place of his own residence from whence she might judge herself whether barton cottage for the houses were in the same parish could by any alteration be made comfortable to her he seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections she needed no time for deliberation or inquiry her resolution was formed as she read the situation of barton in a county so far distant from sussex as devonshire which but a few hours before would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place was now its first recommendation to quit the neighbourhood of norland was no longer an evil it was an object of desire it was a blessing in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter-in-law's guest and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress she instantly wrote sir john middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness and her acceptance of his proposal and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent,1,1,0.9988299956890518
it is but a cottage she continued but i hope to see many of my friends in it a room or two can easily be added and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me i am sure i will find none in accommodating them,1,1,0.7672648027954458
she concluded with a very kind invitation to mr and mrs john dashwood to visit her at barton and to edward she gave one with still greater affection though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than was unavoidable it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended to separate edward and elinor was as far from being her object as ever and she wished to show mrs john dashwood by this pointed invitation to her brother how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match,1,1,0.999115370342938
mr john dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture he really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable -- the furniture was all sent around by water it chiefly consisted of household linen plate china and books with a handsome pianoforte of marianne's mrs john dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh she could not help feeling it hard that as mrs dashwood's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own she should have any handsome article of furniture,1,1,0.9960144614460237
mrs dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth it was ready furnished and she might have immediate possession no difficulty arose on either side in the agreement and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at norland and to determine her future household before she set off for the west and this as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her was soon done -- the horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter for the comfort of her children had she consulted only her own wishes she would have kept it but the discretion of elinor prevailed her wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three two maids and a man with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at norland,1,1,0.9910115866014041
the situation of the house was good high hills rose immediately behind and at no great distance on each side some of which were open downs the others cultivated and woody the village of barton was chiefly on one of these hills and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows the prospect in front was more extensive it commanded the whole of the valley and reached into the country beyond the hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction under another name and in another course it branched out again between two of the steepest of them,1,1,0.6170826998575546
conversation however was not wanted for sir john was very chatty and lady middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child a fine little boy about six years old by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity for they had to enquire his name and age admire his beauty and ask him questions which his mother answered for him while he hung about her and held down his head to the great surprise of her ladyship who wondered at his being so shy before company as he could make noise enough at home on every formal visit a child ought to be of the party by way of provision for discourse in the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother and in what particular he resembled either for of course every body differed and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others,1,1,0.9583705218487527
an opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children as sir john would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day,1,1,0.9266534796480644
lady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table and of all her domestic arrangements and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties but sir john's satisfaction in society was much more real he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold and the noisier they were the better was he pleased he was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen,1,1,0.9370265136012123
mamma you are not doing me justice i know very well that colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature he may live twenty years longer but thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony,1,1,0.8288436856001529
the whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks the high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties and towards one of these hills did marianne and margaret one memorable morning direct their steps attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned the weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book in spite of marianne's declaration that the day would be lastingly fair and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills and the two girls set off together,1,1,0.8221989203104773
they set off marianne had at first the advantage but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground and margaret unable to stop herself to assist her was involuntarily hurried along and reached the bottom in safety,1,1,0.7162082832135548
sir john called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors and marianne's accident being related to him he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of willoughby at allenham,1,1,0.9439735820509162
and is that all you can say for him cried marianne indignantly but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance what his pursuits his talents and genius,1,1,0.8833405233346462
yes and he was up again at eight to ride to covert,1,0,0.4413195442507883
aye aye i see how it will be said sir john i see how it will be you will be setting your cap at him now and never think of poor brandon,1,1,0.7970255598649421
that is an expression sir john said marianne warmly which i particularly dislike i abhor every common-place phrase by which wit is intended and 'setting one's cap at a man ' or 'making a conquest ' are the most odious of all their tendency is gross and illiberal and if their construction could ever be deemed clever time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity,1,1,0.8528914756333272
miss dashwood had a delicate complexion regular features and a remarkably pretty figure marianne was still handsomer her form though not so correct as her sister's in having the advantage of height was more striking and her face was so lovely that when in the common cant of praise she was called a beautiful girl truth was less violently outraged than usually happens her skin was very brown but from its transparency her complexion was uncommonly brilliant her features were all good her smile was sweet and attractive and in her eyes which were very dark there was a life a spirit an eagerness which could hardily be seen without delight from willoughby their expression was at first held back by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created but when this passed away when her spirits became collected when she saw that to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman he united frankness and vivacity and above all when she heard him declare that of music and dancing he was passionately fond she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay,1,1,0.9492961565416841
my love said her mother you must not be offended with elinor -- she was only in jest i should scold her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend -- marianne was softened in a moment,1,1,0.9452671602405932
her mother too in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised by his prospect of riches was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as edward and willoughby,1,1,0.9608813665477207
perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by willoughby and marianne who prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young seemed resolved to undervalue his merits,1,1,0.9540090543125014
brandon is just the kind of man said willoughby one day when they were talking of him together whom every body speaks well of and nobody cares about whom all are delighted to see and nobody remembers to talk to,1,1,0.8684918247859995
add to which cried marianne that he has neither genius taste nor spirit that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice no expression,1,1,0.8132900781278122
miss dashwood cried willoughby you are now using me unkindly you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason and to convince me against my will but it will not do you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare if it will be any satisfaction to you however to be told that i believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable i am ready to confess it and in return for an acknowledgment which must give me some pain you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever,1,1,0.9238091036448306
no replied elinor her opinions are all romantic,1,1,0.8258702722982457
this will probably be the case he replied and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions,1,1,0.8073292907311076
this said he cannot hold but a change a total change of sentiments -- no no do not desire it for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common and too dangerous i speak from experience i once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister who thought and judged like her but who from an inforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances -- here he stopt suddenly appeared to think that he had said too much and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures which might not otherwise have entered elinor's head the lady would probably have passed without suspicion had he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips as it was it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard elinor attempted no more but marianne in her place would not have done so little the whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love,1,1,0.9901730665958648
oh elinor she cried i have such a secret to tell you about marianne i am sure she will be married to mr willoughby very soon,1,1,0.9924117842783093
take care margaret it may be only the hair of some great uncle of his,1,1,0.7091761229450607
but indeed elinor it is marianne's i am almost sure it is for i saw him cut it off last night after tea when you and mama went out of the room they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be and he seemed to be begging something of her and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair for it was all tumbled down her back and he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of white paper and put it into his pocket-book,1,0,0.4419204208037082
i never had any conjectures about it replied margaret it was you who told me of it yourself,1,1,0.8167372649214131
a party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from barton belonging to a brother-in-law of colonel brandon without whose interest it could not be seen as the proprietor who was then abroad had left strict orders on that head the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful and sir john who was particularly warm in their praise might be allowed to be a tolerable judge for he had formed parties to visit them at least twice every summer for the last ten years they contained a noble piece of water a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning's amusement cold provisions were to be taken open carriages only to be employed and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure,1,1,0.9647158463910946
i hope he has had no bad news said lady middleton it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly,1,1,0.9031916176218084
well then i know who it is from colonel and i hope she is well,1,1,0.58328076908774
there is no persuading you to change your mind brandon i know of old said sir john when once you are determined on anything but however i hope you will think better of it consider here are the two miss careys come over from newton the three miss dashwoods walked up from the cottage and mr willoughby got up two hours before his usual time on purpose to go to whitwell,1,1,0.9689380336524788
oh he must and shall come back cried sir john if he is not here by the end of the week i shall go after him,1,1,0.5807986965296185
what do not you know who miss williams is i am sure you must have heard of her before she is a relation of the colonel's my dear a very near relation we will not say how near for fear of shocking the young ladies then lowering her voice a little she said to elinor she is his natural daughter,1,1,0.9407356023034946
oh yes and as like him as she can stare i dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune,1,1,0.6143470146915198
yes marianne but i would not go while mrs smith was there and with no other companion than mr willoughby,1,1,0.9893604559159315
on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it elinor for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did i should have been sensible of it at the time for we always know when we are acting wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure,1,1,0.9414600000246565
the promise was readily given and willoughby's behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness,1,1,0.9669604617222609
is anything the matter with her cried mrs dashwood as she entered -- is she ill,1,1,0.9386239408259368
it is all very strange so suddenly to be gone it seems but the work of a moment and last night he was with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate and now after only ten minutes notice -- gone too without intending to return -- something more than what be owned to us must have happened he did not speak he did not behave like himself you must have seen the difference as well as i what can it be can they have quarrelled why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here --,1,1,0.7813814879754407
it was not inclination that he wanted elinor i could plainly see that he had not the power of accepting it i have thought it all over i assure you and i can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you,1,1,0.9254349881646226
they were interrupted by the entrance of margaret and elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations of her mother to acknowledge the probability of many and hope for the justice of all,1,1,0.9307426950572647
they saw nothing of marianne till dinner time when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word her eyes were red and swollen and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty she avoided the looks of them all could neither eat nor speak and after some time on her mother's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome she burst into tears and left the room,1,1,0.8485030021846052
when breakfast was over she walked out by herself and wandered about the village of allenham indulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning,1,1,0.7776191239940234
it is he it is indeed -- i know it is -- and was hastening to meet him when elinor cried out,1,1,0.6210080597439664
indeed marianne i think you are mistaken it is not willoughby the person is not tall enough for him and has not his air,1,1,0.8729354074058975
he was welcomed by them all with great cordiality but especially by marianne who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than even elinor herself to marianne indeed the meeting between edward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at norland in their mutual behaviour on edward's side more particularly there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion he was confused seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them looked neither rapturous nor gay said little but what was forced from him by questions and distinguished elinor by no mark of affection marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise she began almost to feel a dislike of edward and it ended as every feeling must end with her by carrying back her thoughts to willoughby whose manners formed a contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect,1,1,0.998046846822495
and how does dear dear norland look cried marianne,1,1,0.9351059941668672
dear dear norland said elinor probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year the woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves,1,1,0.5528960764716898
perhaps said elinor smiling we may come to the same point your competence and my wealth are very much alike i dare say and without them as the world goes now we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting your ideas are only more noble than mine come what is your competence,1,1,0.6988620957591737
elinor laughed two thousand a year one is my wealth i guessed how it would end,1,1,0.7463777535159233
oh that they would cried marianne her eyes sparkling with animation and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness,1,1,0.8806901561966892
she is only grown a little more grave than she was,1,0,0.44812657751220236
nay edward said marianne you need not reproach me you are not very gay yourself,1,1,0.8890242335829196
but i thought it was right elinor said marianne to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people i thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours this has always been your doctrine i am sure,1,1,0.912719516484482
you have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility said edward to elinor do you gain no ground,1,1,0.9365614899894955
marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers said elinor,1,1,0.9365507040036776
she knows her own worth too well for false shame replied edward shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other if i could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful i should not be shy,1,1,0.8856029751513609
i am going into the village to see my horses said be as you are not yet ready for breakfast i shall be back again presently,1,0,0.3706563329472541
i am afraid it is but too true said marianne but why should you boast of it,1,1,0.7552672876509217
i am convinced said edward that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms i have more pleasure in a snug farm-house than a watch-tower -- and a troop of tidy happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world,1,1,0.6632252406157868
i never saw you wear a ring before edward she cried is that fanny's hair i remember her promising to give you some but i should have thought her hair had been darker,1,1,0.7608907536066511
marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt -- but when she saw how much she had pained edward her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his he coloured very deeply and giving a momentary glance at elinor replied yes it is my sister's hair the setting always casts a different shade on it you know,1,1,0.9709068232431839
edward's embarrassment lasted some time and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled he was particularly grave the whole morning marianne severely censured herself for what she had said but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy had she known how little offence it had given her sister,1,1,0.9712283032784644
i think edward said mrs dashwood as they were at breakfast the last morning you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions some inconvenience to your friends indeed might result from it -- you would not be able to give them so much of your time but with a smile you would be materially benefited in one particular at least -- you would know where to go when you left them,1,1,0.9536677878252867
without shutting herself up from her family or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of edward and of edward's behaviour in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce -- with tenderness pity approbation censure and doubt there were moments in abundance when if not by the absence of her mother and sisters at least by the nature of their employments conversation was forbidden among them and every effect of solitude was produced her mind was inevitably at liberty her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere and the past and the future on a subject so interesting must be before her must force her attention and engross her memory her reflection and her fancy,1,1,0.9881496890378576
this was quite a new idea to mrs dashwood she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one and could not help looking with surprise at them both,1,1,0.8973248276871855
mrs palmer laughed and said it would not do her any harm,1,1,0.9547230345359615
she expects to be confined in february continued mrs jennings,1,1,0.9531003640156558
when lady middleton rose to go away mr palmer rose also laid down the newspaper stretched himself and looked at them all around,1,0,0.46802442611777023
they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now said elinor by these frequent invitations than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago the alteration is not in them if their parties are grown tedious and dull we must look for the change elsewhere,1,1,0.8654350011084202
you and i sir john said mrs jennings should not stand upon such ceremony,1,1,0.9246457061697158
then you would be very ill-bred cried mr palmer,1,1,0.9128191360324653
my love you contradict every body said his wife with her usual laugh do you know that you are quite rude,1,0,0.4759283685758427
how charming it will be said charlotte when he is in parliament -- won't it how i shall laugh it will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an m p -- but do you know he says he will never frank for me he declares he won't don't you mr palmer,1,1,0.6959754959436689
no said he i never said any thing so irrational don't palm all your abuses of languages upon me,1,0,0.20772051967687344
there now you see how droll he is this is always the way with him sometimes he won't speak to me for half a day together and then he comes out with something so droll -- all about any thing in the world,1,0,0.4017843982451303
don't pretend to deny it because you know it is what every body talks of i assure you i heard of it in my way through town,1,0,0.4799546504880012
oh yes quite well and so full of your praises he did nothing but say fine things of you,1,0,0.4181053266152985
is mr willoughby much known in your part of somersetshire said elinor,1,1,0.9641700507562116
yes a great while ever since my sister married -- he was a particular friend of sir john's i believe she added in a low voice he would have been very glad to have had me if he could sir john and lady middleton wished it very much but mama did not think the match good enough for me otherwise sir john would have mentioned it to the colonel and we should have been married immediately,1,1,0.9921907684887118
and soon afterwards on the second boy's violently pinching one of the same lady's fingers she fondly observed how playful william is,1,1,0.5168272921519214
and here is my sweet little annamaria she added tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old who had not made a noise for the last two minutes and she is always so gentle and quiet -- never was there such a quiet little thing,1,1,0.5365974496397309
but unfortunately in bestowing these embraces a pin in her ladyship's head dress slightly scratching the child's neck produced from this pattern of gentleness such violent screams as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy the mother's consternation was excessive but it could not surpass the alarm of the miss steeles and every thing was done by all three in so critical an emergency which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer she was seated in her mother's lap covered with kisses her wound bathed with lavender-water by one of the miss steeles who was on her knees to attend her and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other with such a reward for her tears the child was too wise to cease crying she still screamed and sobbed lustily kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her and all their united soothings were ineffectual till lady middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected -- she was carried out of the room therefore in her mother's arms in quest of this medicine and as the two boys chose to follow though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours,1,1,0.9192049058827402
and sir john too cried the elder sister what a charming man he is,1,1,0.7878774635366658
a short pause succeeded this speech which was first broken by miss steele who seemed very much disposed for conversation and who now said rather abruptly and how do you like devonshire miss dashwood i suppose you were very sorry to leave sussex,1,1,0.9398625562904266
i think every one must admire it replied elinor who ever saw the place though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do,1,1,0.8772037245135503
'twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure said she and i hear he is quite a beau and prodigious handsome and i hope you may have as good luck yourself soon -- but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already,1,1,0.8827419159204842
elinor could not suppose that sir john would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for edward than he had been with respect to marianne indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two as being somewhat newer and more conjectural and since edward's visit they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks as to excite general attention the letter f -- had been likewise invariably brought forward and found productive of such countless jokes that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long established with elinor,1,1,0.9925063730500208
elinor heard all this with attention and surprise and who was this uncle where did he live how came they acquainted she wished very much to have the subject continued though she did not chuse to join in it herself but nothing more of it was said and for the first time in her life she thought mrs jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information or in a disposition to communicate it the manner in which miss steele had spoken of edward increased her curiosity for it struck her as being rather ill-natured and suggested the suspicion of that lady's knowing or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage -- but her curiosity was unavailing for no farther notice was taken of mr ferrars's name by miss steele when alluded to or even openly mentioned by sir john,1,1,0.9986953100337111
no returned elinor cautious of giving her real opinion of edward's mother and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity -- i know nothing of her,1,1,0.972602389723791
what felt elinor at that moment astonishment that would have been as painful as it was strong had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it she turned towards lucy in silent amazement unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration and though her complexion varied she stood firm in incredulity and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit or a swoon,1,1,0.8837354289380861
elinor for a few moments remained silent her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words but at length forcing herself to speak and to speak cautiously she said with calmness of manner which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude -- may i ask if your engagement is of long standing,1,1,0.9350768518553814
we can mean no other cried lucy smiling mr edward ferrars the eldest son of mrs ferrars of park street and brother of your sister-in-law mrs john dashwood is the person i mean you must allow that i am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends,1,1,0.9941513774954726
four years you have been engaged said she with a firm voice,1,1,0.5685662652733734
as she said this she looked earnestly at lucy hoping to discover something in her countenance perhaps the falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying but lucy's countenance suffered no change,1,1,0.9454300467091891
i was afraid you would think i was taking a great liberty with you said she in telling you all this i have not known you long to be sure personally at least but i have known you and all your family by description a great while and as soon as i saw you i felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance besides in the present case i really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about edward's mother and i am so unfortunate that i have not a creature whose advice i can ask anne is the only person that knows of it and she has no judgment at all indeed she does me a great deal more harm than good for i am in constant fear of her betraying me she does not know how to hold her tongue as you must perceive and i am sure i was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day when edward's name was mentioned by sir john lest she should out with it all you can't think how much i go through in my mind from it altogether i only wonder that i am alive after what i have suffered for edward's sake these last four years every thing in such suspense and uncertainty and seeing him so seldom -- we can hardly meet above twice a-year i am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke,1,1,0.9796333790396556
sometimes continued lucy after wiping her eyes i think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely as she said this she looked directly at her companion but then at other times i have not resolution enough for it -- i cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable as i know the very mention of such a thing would do and on my own account too -- so dear as he is to me -- i don't think i could be equal to it what would you advise me to do in such a case miss dashwood what would you do yourself,1,1,0.9551957180716096
we did indeed particularly so when he first arrived,1,1,0.7366735608596806
the youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature but the four succeeding years -- years which if rationally spent give such improvement to the understanding must have opened his eyes to her defects of education while the same period of time spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty,1,1,0.9502455085110031
one or two meetings of this kind had taken place without affording elinor any chance of engaging lucy in private when sir john called at the cottage one morning to beg in the name of charity that they would all dine with lady middleton that day as he was obliged to attend the club at exeter and she would otherwise be quite alone except her mother and the two miss steeles elinor who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view in such a party as this was likely to be more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well-bred direction of lady middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose immediately accepted the invitation margaret with her mother's permission was equally compliant and marianne though always unwilling to join any of their parties was persuaded by her mother who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement to go likewise,1,1,0.9980204610588207
in a firm though cautious tone elinor thus began,1,1,0.6675003645937997
edward's love for me said lucy has been pretty well put to the test by our long very long absence since we were first engaged and it has stood the trial so well that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment's alarm on that account from the first,1,1,0.8611351484507916
lucy went on i am rather of a jealous temper too by nature and from our different situations in life from his being so much more in the world than me and our continual separation i was enough inclined for suspicion to have found out the truth in an instant if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met or any lowness of spirits that i could not account for or if he had talked more of one lady than another or seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he used to be i do not mean to say that i am particularly observant or quick-sighted in general but in such a case i am sure i could not be deceived,1,1,0.9580712710455163
but what said she after a short silence are your views or have you none but that of waiting for mrs ferrars's death which is a melancholy and shocking extremity -- is her son determined to submit to this and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth,1,1,0.8722981663007474
then i rather suspect that my interest would do very little,1,1,0.6920188593033457
'tis because you are an indifferent person said lucy with some pique and laying a particular stress on those words that your judgment might justly have such weight with me if you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings your opinion would not be worth having,1,1,0.8861244963775571
elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again another pause therefore of many minutes' duration succeeded this speech and lucy was still the first to end it,1,1,0.9327649022296007
from this time the subject was never revived by elinor and when entered on by lucy who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it and was particularly careful to inform her confidante of her happiness whenever she received a letter from edward it was treated by the former with calmness and caution and dismissed as soon as civility would allow for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which lucy did not deserve and which were dangerous to herself,1,1,0.9967070941591816
the visit of the miss steeles at barton park was lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied their favour increased they could not be spared sir john would not hear of their going and in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in exeter in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately which was in full force at the end of every week they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park and to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance,1,1,0.9803422977176345
i am delighted with the plan she cried it is exactly what i could wish margaret and i shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves when you and the middletons are gone we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music you will find margaret so improved when you come back again i have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one it is very right that you should go to town i would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of london you will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman of whose kindness to you i can have no doubt and in all probability you will see your brother and whatever may be his faults or the faults of his wife when i consider whose son he is i cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other,1,1,0.9502582513987745
though with your usual anxiety for our happiness said elinor you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you there is still one objection which in my opinion cannot be so easily removed,1,1,0.9524287283559513
if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of mrs jennings said marianne at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation i have no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort,1,1,0.9823035478630924
elinor could not find herself in the carriage with mrs jennings and beginning a journey to london under her protection and as her guest without wondering at her own situation so short had their acquaintance with that lady been so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before but these objections had all with that happy ardour of youth which marianne and her mother equally shared been overcome or overlooked and elinor in spite of every occasional doubt of willoughby's constancy could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of marianne without feeling how blank was her own prospect how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of marianne's situation to have the same animating object in view the same possibility of hope a short a very short time however must now decide what willoughby's intentions were in all probability he was already in town marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there and elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention as to ascertain what he was and what he meant before many meetings had taken place should the result of her observations be unfavourable she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister should it be otherwise her exertions would be of a different nature -- she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of marianne,1,1,0.9995941101744692
they were three days on their journey and marianne's behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to mrs jennings might be expected to be she sat in silence almost all the way wrapt in her own meditations and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister to atone for this conduct therefore elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had assigned herself behaved with the greatest attention to mrs jennings talked with her laughed with her and listened to her whenever she could and mrs jennings on her side treated them both with all possible kindness was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod or boiled fowls to veal cutlets they reached town by three o'clock the third day glad to be released after such a journey from the confinement of a carriage and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire,1,1,0.996643906719701
as dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her mother and sat down for that purpose in a few moments marianne did the same i am writing home marianne said elinor had not you better defer your letter for a day or two,1,1,0.9899582119269911
in this calm kind of way with very little interest on either side they continued to talk both of them out of spirits and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere elinor wished very much to ask whether willoughby were then in town but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival and at length by way of saying something she asked if he had been in london ever since she had seen him last yes he replied with some embarrassment almost ever since i have been once or twice at delaford for a few days but it has never been in my power to return to barton,1,1,0.9724122903812469
this and the manner in which it was said immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to mrs jennings and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt,1,1,0.9742114415955628
ay to be sure i thought as much well colonel i have brought two young ladies with me you see -- that is you see but one of them now but there is another somewhere your friend miss marianne too -- which you will not be sorry to hear i do not know what you and mr willoughby will do between you about her ay it is a fine thing to be young and handsome well i was young once but i never was very handsome -- worse luck for me however i got a very good husband and i don't know what the greatest beauty can do more ah poor man he has been dead these eight years and better but colonel where have you been to since we parted and how does your business go on come come let's have no secrets among friends,1,1,0.9346712978794736
it was late in the morning before they returned home and no sooner had they entered the house than marianne flew eagerly up stairs and when elinor followed she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance which declared that no willoughby had been there,1,1,0.9699447367201361
how very odd said she in a low and disappointed voice as she turned away to the window,1,1,0.5714119638074221
how odd indeed repeated elinor within herself regarding her sister with uneasiness if she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him as she did she would have written to combe magna and if he is in town how odd that he should neither come nor write oh my dear mother you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young a man so little known to be carried on in so doubtful so mysterious a manner i long to inquire and how will my interference be borne,1,1,0.9554463436853246
if this open weather holds much longer said mrs jennings when they met at breakfast the following morning sir john will not like leaving barton next week 'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day's pleasure poor souls i always pity them when they do they seem to take it so much to heart,1,1,0.9005760991311641
it was a lucky recollection all her good spirits were restored by it it is charming weather for them indeed she continued as she sat down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance how much they must enjoy it but with a little return of anxiety it cannot be expected to last long at this time of the year and after such a series of rain we shall certainly have very little more of it frosts will soon set in and in all probability with severity in another day or two perhaps this extreme mildness can hardly last longer -- nay perhaps it may freeze tonight,1,1,0.9529036460434218
and now silently conjectured elinor she will write to combe by this day's post,1,1,0.8114537672355192
the miss dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with mrs jennings's style of living and set of acquaintance than with her behaviour to themselves which was invariably kind every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan and excepting a few old city friends whom to lady middleton's regret she had never dropped she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties which whether at home or abroad formed only for cards could have little to amuse her,1,1,0.9979327037355955
about a week after their arrival it became certain that willoughby was also arrived his card was on the table when they came in from the morning's drive,1,1,0.7752587603510317
for me cried marianne stepping hastily forward,1,1,0.5697226423561309
nay elinor this reproach from you -- you who have confidence in no one,1,1,0.8699134171331568
elinor found when the evening was over that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode for although scarcely settled in town sir john had contrived to collect around him nearly twenty young people and to amuse them with a ball this was an affair however of which lady middleton did not approve in the country an unpremeditated dance was very allowable but in london where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained it was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls to have it known that lady middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple with two violins and a mere side-board collation,1,1,0.9779363518592818
mr and mrs palmer were of the party from the former whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law and therefore never came near her they received no mark of recognition on their entrance he looked at them slightly without seeming to know who they were and merely nodded to mrs jennings from the other side of the room marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered it was enough -- he was not there -- and she sat down equally ill-disposed to receive or communicate pleasure after they had been assembled about an hour mr palmer sauntered towards the miss dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town though colonel brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come,1,1,0.9960821492564179
never had marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life as she was that evening and never so much fatigued by the exercise she complained of it as they returned to berkeley street,1,1,0.9654576258921757
he listened to her with silent attention and on her ceasing to speak rose directly from his seat and after saying in a voice of emotion to your sister i wish all imaginable happiness to willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her -- took leave and went away,1,1,0.9370938610727662
they had not remained in this manner long before elinor perceived willoughby standing within a few yards of them in earnest conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman she soon caught his eye and he immediately bowed but without attempting to speak to her or to approach marianne though he could not but see her and then continued his discourse with the same lady elinor turned involuntarily to marianne to see whether it could be unobserved by her at that moment she first perceived him and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight she would have moved towards him instantly had not her sister caught hold of her,1,1,0.9819136600515174
pray pray be composed cried elinor and do not betray what you feel to every body present perhaps he has not observed you yet,1,1,0.8152003987874186
lady middleton though in the middle of a rubber on being informed that marianne was unwell was too polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away and making over her cards to a friend they departed as soon the carriage could be found scarcely a word was spoken during their return to berkeley street marianne was in a silent agony too much oppressed even for tears but as mrs jennings was luckily not come home they could go directly to their own room where hartshorn restored her a little to herself she was soon undressed and in bed and as she seemed desirous of being alone her sister then left her and while she waited the return of mrs jennings had leisure enough for thinking over the past,1,1,0.9954848711022363
as for marianne on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already have given her and on those still more severe which might await her in its probable consequence she could not reflect without the deepest concern her own situation gained in the comparison for while she could esteem edward as much as ever however they might be divided in future her mind might be always supported but every circumstance that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery of marianne in a final separation from willoughby -- in an immediate and irreconcilable rupture with him,1,1,0.9935585011230257
elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more had not marianne entreated her with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability not to speak to her for the world in such circumstances it was better for both that they should not be long together and the restless state of marianne's mind not only prevented her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place made her wander about the house till breakfast time avoiding the sight of every body,1,1,0.9731875728858548
elinor though never less disposed to speak than at that moment obliged herself to answer such an attack as this and therefore trying to smile replied and have you really ma'am talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister's being engaged to mr willoughby i thought it had been only a joke but so serious a question seems to imply more and i must beg therefore that you will not deceive yourself any longer i do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married,1,1,0.9932028044921837
she paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment then read it again and again but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man and so bitter were her feelings against him that she dared not trust herself to speak lest she might wound marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils a connection for life with an unprincipled man as a deliverance the most real a blessing the most important,1,1,0.8981309479248436
i only wish replied her sister there were any thing i could do which might be of comfort to you,1,1,0.9420044341057574
exert yourself dear marianne she cried if you would not kill yourself and all who love you think of your mother think of her misery while you suffer for her sake you must exert yourself,1,1,0.8805048721079312
you must not talk so marianne have you no comforts no friends is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation much as you suffer now think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period -- if your engagement had been carried on for months and months as it might have been before he chose to put an end to it every additional day of unhappy confidence on your side would have made the blow more dreadful,1,1,0.9557982947507627
no he is not so unworthy as you believe him he has broken no faith with me,1,0,0.3230453760851971
yes -- could that be wrong after all that had passed -- but i cannot talk,1,1,0.6592846184855244
m d,1,0,0.3765860428231563
m d,1,0,0.3765860428231563
that such letters so full of affection and confidence could have been so answered elinor for willoughby's sake would have been unwilling to believe but her condemnation of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their having been written at all and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs of tenderness not warranted by anything preceding and most severely condemned by the event when marianne perceiving that she had finished the letters observed to her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written in the same situation,1,1,0.9816593757878634
elinor i have been cruelly used but not by willoughby,1,1,0.9403418635526885
i would do more than for my own but to appear happy when i am so miserable -- oh who can require it,1,1,0.7807384458082812
and yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been -- how long it may have been premeditated and how deeply contrived by her -- who is she -- who can she be -- whom did i ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance -- oh no one no one -- he talked to me only of myself,1,1,0.7905771814931036
how is she miss dashwood -- poor thing she looks very bad -- no wonder ay it is but too true he is to be married very soon -- a good-for-nothing fellow i have no patience with him mrs taylor told me of it half an hour ago and she was told it by a particular friend of miss grey herself else i am sure i should not have believed it and i was almost ready to sink as it was well said i all i can say is that if this be true he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill and i wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out and so i shall always say my dear you may depend on it i have no notion of men's going on in this way and if ever i meet him again i will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day but there is one comfort my dear miss marianne he is not the only young man in the world worth having and with your pretty face you will never want admirers well poor thing i won't disturb her any longer for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with the parrys and sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know and that will amuse her,1,1,0.9792542723919282
when there though looking most wretchedly she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected had she tried to speak or had she been conscious of half mrs jennings's well-meant but ill-judged attentions to her this calmness could not have been maintained but not a syllable escaped her lips and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her,1,1,0.9798539152312371
fifty thousand pounds my dear did you ever see her a smart stylish girl they say but not handsome i remember her aunt very well biddy henshawe she married a very wealthy man but the family are all rich together fifty thousand pounds and by all accounts it won't come before it's wanted for they say he is all to pieces no wonder dashing about with his curricle and hunters well it don't signify talking but when a young man be who he will comes and makes love to a pretty girl and promises marriage he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor and a richer girl is ready to have him why don't he in such a case sell his horses let his house turn off his servants and make a thorough reform at once i warrant you miss marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round but that won't do now-a-days nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age,1,1,0.7735631549531228
dear ma'am this kindness is quite unnecessary marianne i dare say will not leave her room again this evening i shall persuade her if i can to go early to bed for i am sure she wants rest,1,1,0.9617431590273066
it would be unnecessary i am sure for you to caution mrs palmer and sir john against ever naming mr willoughby or making the slightest allusion to what has passed before my sister their own good-nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject the more my feelings will be spared as you my dear madam will easily believe,1,1,0.9803799379973878
oh lord yes that i do indeed it must be terrible for you to hear it talked of and as for your sister i am sure i would not mention a word about it to her for the world you saw i did not all dinner time no more would sir john nor my daughters for they are all very thoughtful and considerate especially if i give them a hint as i certainly will for my part i think the less that is said about such things the better the sooner 'tis blown over and forgot and what does talking ever do you know,1,1,0.7924123793529542
marianne is not well said she she has been indisposed all day and we have persuaded her to go to bed,1,1,0.8907918209095699
you mean answered elinor with forced calmness mr willoughby's marriage with miss grey yes we do know it all this seems to have been a day of general elucidation for this very morning first unfolded it to us mr willoughby is unfathomable where did you hear it,1,1,0.9195759740896485
from a night of more sleep than she had expected marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes,1,1,0.8288787765416704
now my dear i bring you something that i am sure will do you good,1,1,0.5950406617862195
marianne heard enough in one moment her imagination placed before her a letter from willoughby full of tenderness and contrition explanatory of all that had passed satisfactory convincing and instantly followed by willoughby himself rushing eagerly into the room to inforce at her feet by the eloquence of his eyes the assurances of his letter the work of one moment was destroyed by the next the hand writing of her mother never till then unwelcome was before her and in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope she felt as if till that instant she had never suffered,1,1,0.965110367712882
in this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour when marianne whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise was startled by a rap at the door,1,1,0.7754989112872588
who can this be cried elinor so early too i thought we had been safe,1,1,0.8124712325578425
i met mrs jennings in bond street said he after the first salutation and she encouraged me to come on and i was the more easily encouraged because i thought it probable that i might find you alone which i was very desirous of doing my object -- my wish -- my sole wish in desiring it -- i hope i believe it is -- is to be a means of giving comfort -- no i must not say comfort -- not present comfort -- but conviction lasting conviction to your sister's mind my regard for her for yourself for your mother -- will you allow me to prove it by relating some circumstances which nothing but a very sincere regard -- nothing but an earnest desire of being useful -- i think i am justified -- though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that i am right is there not some reason to fear i may be wrong he stopped,1,1,0.9841047816945994
you shall and to be brief when i quitted barton last october -- but this will give you no idea -- i must go farther back you will find me a very awkward narrator miss dashwood i hardly know where to begin a short account of myself i believe will be necessary and it shall be a short one on such a subject sighing heavily can i have little temptation to be diffuse,1,1,0.9412821950877253
he stopt a moment for recollection and then with another sigh went on,1,1,0.6370608305601421
it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned to england my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek for her but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy i could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person he imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief at last however and after i had been six months in england i did find her regard for a former servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit him in a spunging-house where he was confined for debt and there the same house under a similar confinement was my unfortunate sister so altered -- so faded -- worn down by acute suffering of every kind hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me to be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom i had once doted what i endured in so beholding her -- but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it -- i have pained you too much already that she was to all appearance in the last stage of a consumption was -- yes in such a situation it was my greatest comfort life could do nothing for her beyond giving time for a better preparation for death and that was given i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings and under proper attendants i visited her every day during the rest of her short life i was with her in her last moments,1,1,0.9795262995728048
good heavens cried elinor could it be -- could willoughby --,1,1,0.9396806459287568
his character is now before you expensive dissipated and worse than both knowing all this as i have now known it many weeks guess what i must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever and on being assured that she was to marry him guess what i must have felt for all your sakes when i came to you last week and found you alone i came determined to know the truth though irresolute what to do when it was known my behaviour must have seemed strange to you then but now you will comprehend it to suffer you all to be so deceived to see your sister -- but what could i do i had no hope of interfering with success and sometimes i thought your sister's influence might yet reclaim him but now after such dishonorable usage who can tell what were his designs on her whatever they may have been however she may now and hereafter doubtless will turn with gratitude towards her own condition when she compares it with that of my poor eliza when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl and pictures her to herself with an affection for him so strong still as strong as her own and with a mind tormented by self-reproach which must attend her through life surely this comparison must have its use with her she will feel her own sufferings to be nothing they proceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrace on the contrary every friend must be made still more her friend by them concern for her unhappiness and respect for her fortitude under it must strengthen every attachment use your own discretion however in communicating to her what i have told you you must know best what will be its effect but had i not seriously and from my heart believed it might be of service might lessen her regrets i would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others,1,1,0.9941387847040135
elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to marianne from the communication of what had passed,1,1,0.9791493847374257
recollecting soon afterwards that he was probably dividing elinor from her sister he put an end to his visit receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him,1,1,0.9628259047692351
when the particulars of this conversation were repeated by miss dashwood to her sister as they very soon were the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see not that marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention made neither objection nor remark attempted no vindication of willoughby and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible but though this behaviour assured elinor that the conviction of this guilt was carried home to her mind though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it in her no longer avoiding colonel brandon when he called in her speaking to him even voluntarily speaking with a kind of compassionate respect and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before she did not see her less wretched her mind did become settled but it was settled in a gloomy dejection she felt the loss of willoughby's character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart his seduction and desertion of miss williams the misery of that poor girl and the doubt of what his designs might once have been on herself preyed altogether so much on her spirits that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to elinor and brooding over her sorrows in silence gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them,1,1,0.9982802113420256
her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing willoughby's name mentioned was not thrown away marianne though without knowing it herself reaped all its advantage for neither mrs jennings nor sir john nor even mrs palmer herself ever spoke of him before her elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself but that was impossible and she was obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all,1,1,0.9979649853658743
the rest of mrs palmer's sympathy was shewn in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage and communicating them to elinor she could soon tell at what coachmaker's the new carriage was building by what painter mr willoughby's portrait was drawn and at what warehouse miss grey's clothes might be seen,1,1,0.948488516331262
early in february within a fortnight from the receipt of willoughby's letter elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married she had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over as she was desirous that marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers which she saw her eagerly examining every morning,1,1,0.9918353872197407
about this time the two miss steeles lately arrived at their cousin's house in bartlett's buildings holburn presented themselves again before their more grand relations in conduit and berkeley streets and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality,1,1,0.8954991866094159
elinor perfectly understood her and was forced to use all her self-command to make it appear that she did not,1,1,0.9323959878044752
oh dear that is a great pity but such old friends as lucy and me -- i think she might see us and i am sure we would not speak a word,1,1,0.8581856964169007
when they stopped at the door mrs jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call and as she had no business at gray's it was resolved that while her young friends transacted their's she should pay her visit and return for them,1,1,0.9632828117482424
their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in mr gray's shop john dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again it rather gave them satisfaction and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive,1,1,0.9507952862721841
i wished very much to call upon you yesterday said he but it was impossible for we were obliged to take harry to see the wild beasts at exeter exchange and we spent the rest of the day with mrs ferrars harry was vastly pleased this morning i had fully intended to call on you if i could possibly find a spare half hour but one has always so much to do on first coming to town i am come here to bespeak fanny a seal but tomorrow i think i shall certainly be able to call in berkeley street and be introduced to your friend mrs jennings i understand she is a woman of very good fortune and the middletons too you must introduce me to them as my mother-in-law's relations i shall be happy to show them every respect they are excellent neighbours to you in the country i understand,1,1,0.9847645449111859
elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him by the arrival of mrs jennings's servant who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door,1,1,0.9818738137492757
mr dashwood attended them down stairs was introduced to mrs jennings at the door of her carriage and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day took leave,1,1,0.9754622445494505
his visit was duly paid he came with a pretence at an apology from their sister-in-law for not coming too but she was so much engaged with her mother that really she had no leisure for going any where mrs jennings however assured him directly that she should not stand upon ceremony for they were all cousins or something like it and she should certainly wait on mrs john dashwood very soon and bring her sisters to see her his manners to them though calm were perfectly kind to mrs jennings most attentively civil and on colonel brandon's coming in soon after himself he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say that he only wanted to know him to be rich to be equally civil to him,1,1,0.9963313576714132
i am glad of it he seems a most gentlemanlike man and i think elinor i may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life,1,1,0.8729335427483814
indeed i believe you replied elinor but i am very sure that colonel brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying me,1,1,0.9831530564159016
it is not actually settled but there is such a thing in agitation he has a most excellent mother mrs ferrars with the utmost liberality will come forward and settle on him a thousand a year if the match takes place the lady is the hon miss morton only daughter of the late lord morton with thirty thousand pounds a very desirable connection on both sides and i have not a doubt of its taking place in time a thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away to make over for ever but mrs ferrars has a noble spirit to give you another instance of her liberality -- the other day as soon as we came to town aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now she put bank-notes into fanny's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds and extremely acceptable it is for we must live at a great expense while we are here,1,1,0.9752377217415082
she seems a most valuable woman indeed -- her house her style of living all bespeak an exceeding good income and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto but in the end may prove materially advantageous -- her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour and indeed it speaks altogether so great a regard for you that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten -- she must have a great deal to leave,1,1,0.9647253406399847
her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not disregard nothing can be kinder than her behaviour and she can hardly do all this without being aware of the expectation it raises,1,1,0.9813419269254221
she is not well she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks,1,1,0.8344550850592113
they were lucky enough to find lady middleton at home and sir john came in before their visit ended abundance of civilities passed on all sides sir john was ready to like anybody and though mr dashwood did not seem to know much about horses he soon set him down as a very good-natured fellow while lady middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having and mr dashwood went away delighted with both,1,1,0.987468010102473
i shall have a charming account to carry to fanny said he as he walked back with his sister lady middleton is really a most elegant woman such a woman as i am sure fanny will be glad to know and mrs jennings too an exceedingly well-behaved woman though not so elegant as her daughter your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting her which to say the truth has been a little the case and very naturally for we only knew that mrs jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way and fanny and mrs ferrars were both strongly prepossessed that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as fanny would like to associate with but now i can carry her a most satisfactory account of both,1,1,0.9955019287364337
elinor wanted very much to know though she did not chuse to ask whether edward was then in town but nothing would have induced fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her till able to tell her that his marriage with miss morton was resolved on or till her husband's expectations on colonel brandon were answered because she believed them still so very much attached to each other that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion the intelligence however which she would not give soon flowed from another quarter lucy came very shortly to claim elinor's compassion on being unable to see edward though he had arrived in town with mr and mrs dashwood he dared not come to bartlett's buildings for fear of detection and though their mutual impatience to meet was not to be told they could do nothing at present but write,1,1,0.9991161040420137
edward assured them himself of his being in town within a very short time by twice calling in berkeley street twice was his card found on the table when they returned from their morning's engagements elinor was pleased that he had called and still more pleased that she had missed him,1,1,0.9588561494371515
so well had they recommended themselves to lady middleton so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her that though lucy was certainly not so elegant and her sister not even genteel she was as ready as sir john to ask them to spend a week or two in conduit street and it happened to be particularly convenient to the miss steeles as soon as the dashwoods' invitation was known that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place,1,1,0.9976791625120537
their claims to the notice of mrs john dashwood as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother might not have done much however towards procuring them seats at her table but as lady middleton's guests they must be welcome and lucy who had long wanted to be personally known to the family to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them had seldom been happier in her life than she was on receiving mrs john dashwood's card,1,1,0.9950646491924775
elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being miss morton's mother rather than her own whom they were about to behold but instead of doing that she assured her and with great sincerity that she did pity her -- to the utter amazement of lucy who though really uncomfortable herself hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to elinor,1,1,0.991340824101217
had both the children been there the affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once but as harry only was present it was all conjectural assertion on both sides and every body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion and to repeat it over and over again as often as they liked,1,1,0.8777146940590707
lucy who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them and miss steele with yet greater address gave it as fast as she could in favour of each,1,1,0.9371109647866521
hum -- said mrs ferrars -- very pretty -- and without regarding them at all returned them to her daughter,1,1,0.9062443093415541
beautifully indeed but she does every thing well,1,1,0.7373712292768143
this is admiration of a very particular kind -- what is miss morton to us -- who knows or who cares for her -- it is elinor of whom we think and speak,1,1,0.9195203981766231
marianne's feelings did not stop here the cold insolence of mrs ferrars's general behaviour to her sister seemed to her to foretell such difficulties and distresses to elinor as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility she moved after a moment to her sister's chair and putting one arm round her neck and one cheek close to hers said in a low but eager voice,1,1,0.9537439634055215
dear dear elinor don't mind them don't let them make you unhappy,1,1,0.6109989116002479
elinor's curiosity to see mrs ferrars was satisfied -- she had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable -- she had seen enough of her pride her meanness and her determined prejudice against herself to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement and retarded the marriage of edward and herself had he been otherwise free -- and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her own sake that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of mrs ferrars's creation preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice or any solicitude for her good opinion or at least if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in edward's being fettered to lucy she determined that had lucy been more amiable she ought to have rejoiced,1,1,0.9987369481784798
undoubtedly if they had known your engagement said she nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you -- but as that was not the case --,1,1,0.9042887294605337
but elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she should tell her sister lucy continued,1,1,0.9918940587508095
dear edward she cried this is a moment of great happiness -- this would almost make amends for every thing,1,1,0.9298977235155009
this remark was not calculated to make edward or elinor more easy nor to conciliate the good will of lucy who looked up at marianne with no very benignant expression,1,1,0.9314646874174257
not at all i expected much pleasure in it but i have found none the sight of you edward is the only comfort it has afforded and thank heaven you are what you always were,1,1,0.8383413368208171
perhaps miss marianne cried lucy eager to take some revenge on her you think young men never stand upon engagements if they have no mind to keep them little as well as great,1,1,0.9079378107558621
elinor was very angry but marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting for she calmly replied,1,1,0.9133719399462477
going so soon said marianne my dear edward this must not be,1,1,0.9724048405814538
as elinor was neither musical nor affecting to be so she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte whenever it suited her and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp and violoncello would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room in one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of young men the very he who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases at gray's she perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself and speaking familiarly to her brother and had just determined to find out his name from the latter when they both came towards her and mr dashwood introduced him to her as mr robert ferrars,1,1,0.9786736653818251
elinor agreed to it all for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition,1,1,0.9670098068865571
i do not see how it can be done said she without affronting lady middleton for they spend every day with her otherwise i should be exceedingly glad to do it you know i am always ready to pay them any attention in my power as my taking them out this evening shews but they are lady middleton's visitors how can i ask them away from her,1,1,0.9646630843227438
something so strange but you shall hear it all -- when i got to mr palmer's i found charlotte quite in a fuss about the child she was sure it was very ill -- it cried and fretted and was all over pimples so i looked at it directly and 'lord my dear ' says i 'it is nothing in the world but the red gum -- ' and nurse said just the same but charlotte she would not be satisfied so mr donavan was sent for and luckily he happened to just come in from harley street so he stepped over directly and as soon as ever he saw the child be said just as we did that it was nothing in the world but the red gum and then charlotte was easy and so just as he was going away again it came into my head i am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news so upon that he smirked and simpered and looked grave and seemed to know something or other and at last he said in a whisper 'for fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister's indisposition i think it advisable to say that i believe there is no great reason for alarm i hope mrs dashwood will do very well ',1,1,0.8684426528906455
four months -- cried marianne again -- so calm -- so cheerful -- how have you been supported --,1,1,0.8870278657040156
if such is your way of thinking said marianne if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else your resolution your self-command are perhaps a little less to be wondered at -- they are brought more within my comprehension,1,1,0.887703759478809
you have heard i suppose said he with great solemnity as soon as he was seated of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday,1,1,0.5491232694983557
well may you wonder marianne replied her brother at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these your exclamation is very natural,1,1,0.8279199235777401
all this however he continued was urged in vain edward said very little but what he did say was in the most determined manner nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement he would stand to it cost him what it might,1,1,0.9218663527992521
poor young man cried mrs jennings i am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house and so i would tell him if i could see him it is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now at lodgings and taverns,1,1,0.8287748357767329
well said mrs jennings that is her revenge everybody has a way of their own but i don't think mine would be to make one son independent because another had plagued me,1,1,0.7779353401548086
get it all out of her my dear she will tell you any thing if you ask you see i cannot leave mrs clarke,1,1,0.7654435050970456
well but miss dashwood speaking triumphantly people may say what they chuse about mr ferrars's declaring he would not have lucy for it is no such thing i can tell you and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured reports to be spread abroad whatever lucy might think about it herself you know it was no business of other people to set it down for certain,1,1,0.9674326943764969
no indeed not us la miss dashwood do you think people make love when any body else is by oh for shame -- to be sure you must know better than that laughing affectedly -- no no they were shut up in the drawing-room together and all i heard was only by listening at the door,1,1,0.838928063496137
oh la there is nothing in that i only stood at the door and heard what i could and i am sure lucy would have done just the same by me for a year or two back when martha sharpe and i had so many secrets together she never made any bones of hiding in a closet or behind a chimney-board on purpose to hear what we said,1,0,0.442909493501344
well said elinor it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst you have got your answer ready,1,1,0.7651957657116634
perhaps mrs jennings was in hopes by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui to provoke him to make that offer which might give himself an escape from it -- and if so she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained for on elinor's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print which she was going to copy for her friend he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning and conversed with her there for several minutes the effect of his discourse on the lady too could not escape her observation for though she was too honorable to listen and had even changed her seat on purpose that she might not hear to one close by the piano forte on which marianne was playing she could not keep herself from seeing that elinor changed colour attended with agitation and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment -- still farther in confirmation of her hopes in the interval of marianne's turning from one lesson to another some words of the colonel's inevitably reached her ear in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house this set the matter beyond a doubt she wondered indeed at his thinking it necessary to do so but supposed it to be the proper etiquette what elinor said in reply she could not distinguish but judged from the motion of her lips that she did not think that any material objection -- and mrs jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest they then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable when another lucky stop in marianne's performance brought her these words in the colonel's calm voice --,1,1,0.9926021780234626
this is very strange -- sure he need not wait to be older,1,0,0.49464851587457737
what had really passed between them was to this effect,1,1,0.61040213155308
the smallness of the house said she i cannot imagine any inconvenience to them for it will be in proportion to their family and income,1,1,0.8880659017609493
such was the sentence which when misunderstood so justly offended the delicate feelings of mrs jennings but after this narration of what really passed between colonel brandon and elinor while they stood at the window the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting may perhaps appear in general not less reasonably excited nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage,1,1,0.9832830437938084
well and whose fault is that why don't he repair it -- who should do it but himself,1,0,0.2824900051814399
certainly ma'am i shall tell marianne of it but i shall not mention it at present to any body else,1,1,0.9235701722948303
no ma'am not even lucy if you please one day's delay will not be very material and till i have written to mr ferrars i think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else i shall do that directly it is of importance that no time should be lost with him for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination,1,1,0.9629606113769005
colonel brandon is so delicate a man that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to mr ferrars than himself,1,1,0.9381533878237963
i have just been thinking of betty's sister my dear i should be very glad to get her so good a mistress but whether she would do for a lady's maid i am sure i can't tell she is an excellent housemaid and works very well at her needle however you will think of all that at your leisure,1,1,0.9389991406624852
certainly ma'am replied elinor not hearing much of what she said and more anxious to be alone than to be mistress of the subject,1,1,0.9609890976286649
elinor had just been congratulating herself in the midst of her perplexity that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth when her visitor entered to force her upon this greatest exertion of all her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance she had not seen him before since his engagement became public and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it which with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of and what she had to tell him made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes he too was much distressed and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment -- whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room he could not recollect but determining to be on the safe side he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any thing after taking a chair,1,1,0.9875572209172373
colonel brandon give me a living -- can it be possible,1,1,0.8798030133861726
colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability i have always heard him spoken of as such and your brother i know esteems him highly he is undoubtedly a sensible man and in his manners perfectly the gentleman,1,1,0.9061550551531344
and with this pleasing anticipation she sat down to reconsider the past recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of edward and of course to reflect on her own with discontent,1,1,0.8747277129264541
two or three months cried mrs jennings lord my dear how calmly you talk of it and can the colonel wait two or three months lord bless me -- i am sure it would put me quite out of patience -- and though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor mr ferrars i do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him sure somebody else might be found that would do as well somebody that is in orders already,1,1,0.9051709902701363
lord bless you my dear -- sure you do not mean to persuade me that the colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to mr ferrars,1,1,0.8788678233880718
it is truly astonishing -- he cried after hearing what she said -- what could be the colonel's motive,1,1,0.7580857862089839
well well whatever colonel brandon may be edward is a very lucky man -- you will not mention the matter to fanny however for though i have broke it to her and she bears it vastly well -- she will not like to hear it much talked of,1,1,0.95816682313691
i only mean that i suppose from your manner of speaking it must be the same to miss morton whether she marry edward or robert,1,1,0.960185780132865
certainly there can be no difference for robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son -- and as to any thing else they are both very agreeable young men i do not know that one is superior to the other,1,1,0.8717886477948871
elinor had heard enough if not to gratify her vanity and raise her self-importance to agitate her nerves and fill her mind -- and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother by the entrance of mr robert ferrars after a few moments' chat john dashwood recollecting that fanny was yet uninformed of her sister's being there quitted the room in quest of her and elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with robert who by the gay unconcern the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother's love and liberality to the prejudice of his banished brother earned only by his own dissipated course of life and that brother's integrity was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart,1,1,0.9964092524049624
elinor while she waited in silence and immovable gravity the conclusion of such folly could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited it was a look however very well bestowed for it relieved her own feelings and gave no intelligence to him he was recalled from wit to wisdom not by any reproof of her's but by his own sensibility,1,1,0.9524545178387089
it amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send her to delaford -- a place in which of all others she would now least chuse to visit or wish to reside for not only was it considered as her future home by her brother and mrs jennings but even lucy when they parted gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there,1,1,0.9952889791875256
elinor's satisfaction at the moment of removal was more positive she had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on she left no creature behind from whom it would give her a moment's regret to be divided for ever she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of lucy's friendship she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by willoughby since his marriage and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at barton might do towards restoring marianne's peace of mind and confirming her own,1,1,0.9948040669353848
the morning was fine and dry and marianne in her plan of employment abroad had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay at cleveland with great surprise therefore did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner she had depended on a twilight walk to the grecian temple and perhaps all over the grounds and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it but a heavy and settled rain even she could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking,1,1,0.9636870672137205
marianne got up the next morning at her usual time to every inquiry replied that she was better and tried to prove herself so by engaging in her accustomary employments but a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand which she was unable to read or in lying weary and languid on a sofa did not speak much in favour of her amendment and when at last she went early to bed more and more indisposed colonel brandon was only astonished at her sister's composure who though attending and nursing her the whole day against marianne inclination and forcing proper medicines on her at night trusted like marianne to the certainty and efficacy of sleep and felt no real alarm,1,1,0.9766312591851715
the next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient she certainly was not better and except that there was no amendment did not appear worse their party was now farther reduced for mr palmer though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good-nature as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife was persuaded at last by colonel brandon to perform his promise of following her and while he was preparing to go colonel brandon himself with a much greater exertion began to talk of going likewise -- here however the kindness of mrs jennings interposed most acceptably for to send the colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister's account would be to deprive them both she thought of every comfort and therefore telling him at once that his stay at cleveland was necessary to herself that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening while miss dashwood was above with her sister c she urged him so strongly to remain that he who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance could not long even affect to demur especially as mrs jennings's entreaty was warmly seconded by mr palmer who seemed to feel a relief to himself in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise miss dashwood in any emergence,1,1,0.9981535176799953
but she must not go round by london cried marianne in the same hurried manner i shall never see her if she goes by london,1,1,0.7633842578895604
elinor could not be cheerful her joy was of a different kind and led to any thing rather than to gaiety marianne restored to life health friends and to her doting mother was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort and expand it in fervent gratitude -- but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy no words no smiles all within elinor's breast was satisfaction silent and strong,1,1,0.9320366704361479
at seven o'clock leaving marianne still sweetly asleep she joined mrs jennings in the drawing-room to tea of breakfast she had been kept by her fears and of dinner by their sudden reverse from eating much -- and the present refreshment therefore with such feelings of content as she brought to it was particularly welcome mrs jennings would have persuaded her at its conclusion to take some rest before her mother's arrival and allow her to take her place by marianne but elinor had no sense of fatigue no capability of sleep at that moment about her and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant mrs jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber to satisfy herself that all continued right left her there again to her charge and her thoughts and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep,1,1,0.9924063682696106
the night was cold and stormy the wind roared round the house and the rain beat against the windows but elinor all happiness within regarded it not marianne slept through every blast and the travellers -- they had a rich reward in store for every present inconvenience,1,1,0.5858914289480046
she hesitated she knew not what to do the possibility of colonel brandon's arriving and finding her there came across her but she had promised to hear him and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged after a moment's recollection therefore concluding that prudence required dispatch and that her acquiescence would best promote it she walked silently towards the table and sat down he took the opposite chair and for half a minute not a word was said by either,1,1,0.9059217940688262
elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever she began to think that be must be in liquor -- the strangeness of such a visit and of such manners seemed no otherwise intelligible and with this impression she immediately rose saying,1,1,0.9281991540165462
i have returned elinor colouring likewise and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him i have heard it all and how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business i confess is beyond my comprehension,1,1,0.9202028388831773
your indifference however towards that unfortunate girl -- i must say it unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be -- your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her do not think yourself excused by any weakness any natural defect of understanding on her side in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours you must have known that while you were enjoying yourself in devonshire pursuing fresh schemes always gay always happy she was reduced to the extremest indigence,1,1,0.9132459002377497
marianne's note by assuring me that i was still as dear to her as in former days that in spite of the many many weeks we had been separated she was as constant in her own feelings and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever awakened all my remorse i say awakened because time and london business and dissipation had in some measure quieted it and i had been growing a fine hardened villain fancying myself indifferent to her and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle trifling business shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so and silencing every reproach overcoming every scruple by secretly saying now and then 'i shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married ' -- but this note made me know myself better i felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world and that i was using her infamously but every thing was then just settled between miss grey and me to retreat was impossible all that i had to do was to avoid you both i sent no answer to marianne intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice and for some time i was even determined not to call in berkeley street -- but at last judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool common acquaintance than anything else i watched you all safely out of the house one morning and left my name,1,1,0.9795527469421573
well let me make haste and be gone your sister is certainly better certainly out of danger,1,1,0.5525972116549784
yes but i had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as i was ashamed to put my name to the original was all her own -- her own happy thoughts and gentle diction but what could i do -- we were engaged every thing in preparation the day almost fixed -- but i am talking like a fool preparation -- day -- in honest words her money was necessary to me and in a situation like mine any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture and after all what did it signify to my character in the opinion of marianne and her friends in what language my answer was couched -- it must have been only to one end my business was to declare myself a scoundrel and whether i did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance -- 'i am ruined for ever in their opinion -- ' said i to myself -- 'i am shut out for ever from their society they already think me an unprincipled fellow this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one ' such were my reasonings as in a sort of desperate carelessness i copied my wife's words and parted with the last relics of marianne her three notes -- unluckily they were all in my pocketbook or i should have denied their existence and hoarded them for ever -- i was forced to put them up and could not even kiss them and the lock of hair -- that too i had always carried about me in the same pocket-book which was now searched by madam with the most ingratiating virulence -- the dear lock -- all every memento was torn from me,1,1,0.8792919271174393
he held out his hand she could not refuse to give him hers's -- he pressed it with affection,1,1,0.6691265838186577
and you do think something better of me than you did -- said he letting it fall and leaning against the mantel-piece as if forgetting he was to go,1,0,0.3029927244493936
willoughby he whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men willoughby in spite of all his faults excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family with a tenderness a regret rather in proportion as she soon acknowledged within herself -- to his wishes than to his merits she felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight by that person of uncommon attraction that open affectionate and lively manner which it was no merit to possess and by that still ardent love for marianne which it was not even innocent to indulge but she felt that it was so long long before she could feel his influence less,1,1,0.9891141142124852
mrs dashwood whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of marianne's being no more had no voice to inquire after her no voice even for elinor but she waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry instantly gave the joyful relief -- and her mother catching it with all her usual warmth was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness as she had been before by her fears she was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend -- and there shedding tears of joy though still unable to speak embraced elinor again and again turning from her at intervals to press colonel brandon's hand with a look which spoke at once her gratitude and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment he shared it however in a silence even greater than her own,1,1,0.9908264101873262
marianne continued to mend every day and the brilliant cheerfulness of mrs dashwood's looks and spirits proved her to be as she repeatedly declared herself one of the happiest women in the world elinor could not hear the declaration nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected edward but mrs dashwood trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which elinor had sent her was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it marianne was restored to her from a danger in which as she now began to feel her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to willoughby had contributed to place her -- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by elinor it was thus imparted to her as soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred,1,1,0.9982511663761793
his regard for her infinitely surpassing anything that willoughby ever felt or feigned as much more warm as more sincere or constant -- which ever we are to call it -- has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear marianne's unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man -- and without selfishness -- without encouraging a hope -- could he have seen her happy with another -- such a noble mind -- such openness such sincerity -- no one can be deceived in him,1,1,0.9674379257668902
his character however answered elinor does not rest on one act of kindness to which his affection for marianne were humanity out of the case would have prompted him to mrs jennings to the middletons he has been long and intimately known they equally love and respect him and even my own knowledge of him though lately acquired is very considerable and so highly do i value and esteem him that if marianne can be happy with him i shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world what answer did you give him -- did you allow him to hope,1,1,0.9875295024362309
his fortune too -- for at my time of life you know everybody cares about that -- and though i neither know nor desire to know what it really is i am sure it must be a good one,1,1,0.6171163389481654
at the end of another day or two marianne growing visibly stronger every twelve hours mrs dashwood urged equally by her own and her daughter's wishes began to talk of removing to barton on her measures depended those of her two friends mrs jennings could not quit cleveland during the dashwoods' stay and colonel brandon was soon brought by their united request to consider his own abode there as equally determinate if not equally indispensable at his and mrs jennings's united request in return mrs dashwood was prevailed on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back for the better accommodation of her sick child and the colonel at the joint invitation of mrs dashwood and mrs jennings whose active good-nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage in the course of a few weeks,1,1,0.9988830667998679
yes my peace of mind is doubly involved in it -- for not only is it horrible to suspect a person who has been what he has been to me of such designs -- but what must it make me appear to myself -- what in a situation like mine but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to --,1,1,0.7526021333270175
they have borne more than our conduct -- do not my dearest elinor let your kindness defend what i know your judgment must censure my illness has made me think -- it has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection long before i was enough recovered to talk i was perfectly able to reflect i considered the past i saw in my own behaviour since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself and want of kindness to others i saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave my illness i well knew had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health as i had felt even at the time to be wrong had i died -- it would have been self-destruction i did not know my danger till the danger was removed but with such feelings as these reflections gave me i wonder at my recovery -- wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live to have time for atonement to my god and to you all did not kill me at once had i died -- in what peculiar misery should i have left you my nurse my friend my sister -- you who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days who had known all the murmurings of my heart -- how should i have lived in your remembrance -- my mother too how could you have consoled her -- i cannot express my own abhorrence of myself whenever i looked towards the past i saw some duty neglected or some failing indulged every body seemed injured by me the kindness the unceasing kindness of mrs jennings i had repaid with ungrateful contempt to the middletons to the palmers the steeles to every common acquaintance even i had been insolent and unjust with a heart hardened against their merits and a temper irritated by their very attention -- to john to fanny -- yes even to them little as they deserve i had given less than their due but you -- you above all above my mother had been wronged by me i and only i knew your heart and its sorrows yet to what did it influence me -- not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself -- your example was before me but to what avail -- was i more considerate of you and your comfort did i imitate your forbearance or lessen your restraints by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone -- no -- not less when i knew you to be unhappy than when i had believed you at ease did i turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me regretting only that heart which had deserted and wronged me and leaving you for or i professed an unbounded affection to be miserable for my sake,1,1,0.993721770865714
she paused -- and added in a low voice if i could but know his heart everything would become easy,1,0,0.49010090919231003
she managed the recital as she hoped with address prepared her anxious listener with caution related simply and honestly the chief points on which willoughby grounded his apology did justice to his repentance and softened only his protestations of present regard marianne said not a word -- she trembled her eyes were fixed on the ground and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them a thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart but she dared not urge one she caught every syllable with panting eagerness her hand unknowingly to herself closely pressed her sister's and tears covered her cheeks,1,1,0.9359437945035671
mrs dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness had not elinor who really wished to hear her sister's unbiased opinion by an eager sign engaged her silence marianne slowly continued --,1,1,0.986603491352007
marianne sighed and repeated i wish for no change,1,1,0.8407119195704236
you consider the matter said elinor exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it and i dare say you perceive as well as myself not only in this but in many other circumstances reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection on his side much less certain had you married you must have been always poor his expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself and his whole conduct declares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him his demands and your inexperience together on a small very small income must have brought on distresses which would not be the less grievous to you from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before your sense of honour and honesty would have led you i know when aware of your situation to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible and perhaps as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort you might have been suffered to practice it but beyond that -- and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage -- beyond that had you endeavoured however reasonably to abridge his enjoyments is it not to be feared that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it you would have lessened your own influence on his heart and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties,1,1,0.9863772587264805
elinor according to her expectation saw on the two or three following days that marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done but while her resolution was unsubdued and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health,1,1,0.9624657712065863
yes ma'am i just see him leaning back in it but he did not look up -- he never was a gentleman much for talking,1,1,0.5125967112420801
they come straight from town as miss lucy -- mrs ferrars told me,1,1,0.9596371869585552
yes ma'am -- but not to bide long they will soon be back again and then they'd be sure and call here,1,1,0.6232059436230446
no ma'am -- the horses were just coming out but i could not bide any longer i was afraid of being late,1,1,0.7594807527734942
that he should be married soon before as she imagined he could be in orders and consequently before he could be in possession of the living surprised her a little at first but she soon saw how likely it was that lucy in her self-provident care in her haste to secure him should overlook every thing but the risk of delay they were married married in town and now hastening down to her uncle's what had edward felt on being within four miles from barton on seeing her mother's servant on hearing lucy's message,1,1,0.9911037328008816
scarcely had she so determined it when the figure of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window he stopt at their gate it was a gentleman it was colonel brandon himself now she could hear more and she trembled in expectation of it but -- it was not colonel brandon -- neither his air -- nor his height were it possible she must say it must be edward she looked again he had just dismounted -- she could not be mistaken -- it was edward she moved away and sat down he comes from mr pratt's purposely to see us i will be calm i will be mistress of myself,1,1,0.9529063887107372
in a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake she saw her mother and marianne change colour saw them look at herself and whisper a few sentences to each other she would have given the world to be able to speak -- and to make them understand that she hoped no coolness no slight would appear in their behaviour to him -- but she had no utterance and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion,1,1,0.9672994248104607
not a syllable passed aloud they all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor his footsteps were heard along the gravel path in a moment he was in the passage and in another he was before them,1,0,0.3799492535668191
marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight to conceal her distress and margaret understanding some part but not the whole of the case thought it incumbent on her to be dignified and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could and maintained a strict silence,1,1,0.9004350475508772
his errand at barton in fact was a simple one it was only to ask elinor to marry him -- and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did so much in need of encouragement and fresh air,1,1,0.8830491747664061
marianne could speak her happiness only by tears comparisons would occur -- regrets would arise -- and her joy though sincere as her love for her sister was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language,1,1,0.9747882044078313
how long it had been carrying on between them however he was equally at a loss with herself to make out for at oxford where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting london he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent nor less affectionate than usual not the smallest suspicion therefore had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed -- and when at last it burst on him in a letter from lucy herself he had been for some time he believed half stupified between the wonder the horror and the joy of such a deliverance he put the letter into elinor's hands,1,1,0.971491594853773
however it may have come about said elinor after a pause -- they are certainly married and your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment the independence she settled on robert through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own choice and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a-year to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by robert's marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her,1,1,0.9795853958814789
that lucy had certainly meant to deceive to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by thomas was perfectly clear to elinor and edward himself now thoroughly enlightened on her character had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill-nature though his eyes had been long opened even before his acquaintance with elinor began to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions -- they had been equally imputed by him to her want of education and till her last letter reached him he had always believed her to be a well-disposed good-hearted girl and thoroughly attached to himself nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement which long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother's anger had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him,1,1,0.9916725333187276
i thought it my duty said he independent of my feelings to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not when i was renounced by my mother and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me in such a situation as that where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement and even now i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted or what fancied advantage it could be to her to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a living,1,1,0.9849759005752919
no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in time relent and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single,1,1,0.9786388321201317
elinor scolded him harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves for having spent so much time with them at norland when he must have felt his own inconstancy,1,1,0.9749686216930585
your behaviour was certainly very wrong said she because -- to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be,1,1,0.8728312883345818
i was simple enough to think that because my faith was plighted to another there could be no danger in my being with you and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour i felt that i admired you but i told myself it was only friendship and till i began to make comparisons between yourself and lucy i did not know how far i was got after that i suppose i was wrong in remaining so much in sussex and the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the expediency of it were no better than these -- the danger is my own i am doing no injury to anybody but myself,1,1,0.8324126882769922
this paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of edward it determined him to attempt a reconciliation though not exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister,1,1,0.9431222035030635
he had nothing to urge against it but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission and therefore to make it easier to him as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper it was resolved that instead of writing to fanny he should go to london and personally intreat her good offices in his favour -- and if they really do interest themselves said marianne in her new character of candour in bringing about a reconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny are not entirely without merit,1,1,0.9666493004049077
after a visit on colonel brandon's side of only three or four days the two gentlemen quitted barton together -- they were to go immediately to delaford that edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it and from thence after staying there a couple of nights he was to proceed on his journey to town,1,1,0.9546099824887023
after a proper resistance on the part of mrs ferrars just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring the reproach of being too amiable edward was admitted to her presence and pronounced to be again her son,1,1,0.9602395855665059
i will not say that i am disappointed my dear sister said john as they were walking together one morning before the gates of delaford house that would be saying too much for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world as it is but i confess it would give me great pleasure to call colonel brandon brother his property here his place his house every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition -- and his woods -- i have not seen such timber any where in dorsetshire as there is now standing in delaford hanger -- and though perhaps marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him -- yet i think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you for as colonel brandon seems a great deal at home nobody can tell what may happen -- for when people are much thrown together and see little of anybody else -- and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage and so forth -- in short you may as well give her a chance -- you understand me --,1,1,0.9803759199781934
but though mrs ferrars did come to see them and always treated them with the make-believe of decent affection they were never insulted by her real favour and preference that was due to the folly of robert and the cunning of his wife and it was earned by them before many months had passed away the selfish sagacity of the latter which had at first drawn robert into the scrape was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it for her respectful humility assiduous attentions and endless flatteries as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise reconciled mrs ferrars to his choice and re-established him completely in her favour,1,1,0.9789867037345579
the chimney-sweeper when my mother died i was very young and my father sold me while yet my tongue could scarcely cry weep weep weep weep so your chimneys i sweep and in soot i sleep there's little tom dacre who cried when his head that curled like a lamb's back was shaved so i said hush tom never mind it for when your head's bare you know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair and so he was quiet and that very night as tom was a-sleeping he had such a sight -- that thousands of sweepers dick joe ned and jack were all of them locked up in coffins of black and by came an angel who had a bright key and he opened the coffins and let them all free then down a green plain leaping laughing they run and wash in a river and shine in the sun then naked and white all their bags left behind they rise upon clouds and sport in the wind and the angel told tom if he'd be a good boy he'd have god for his father and never want joy and so tom awoke and we rose in the dark and got with our bags and our brushes to work though the morning was cold tom was happy and warm so if all do their duty they need not fear harm the little boy lost father father where are you going oh do not walk so fast speak father speak to you little boy or else i shall be lost the night was dark no father was there the child was wet with dew the mire was deep and the child did weep and away the vapour flew the little boy found the little boy lost in the lonely fen led by the wandering light began to cry but god ever nigh appeared like his father in white he kissed the child and by the hand led and to his mother brought who in sorrow pale through the lonely dale the little boy weeping sought laughing song when the green woods laugh with the voice of joy and the dimpling stream runs laughing by when the air does laugh with our merry wit and the green hill laughs with the noise of it when the meadows laugh with lively green and the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene when mary and susan and emily with their sweet round mouths sing ha ha he when the painted birds laugh in the shade where our table with cherries and nuts is spread come live and be merry and join with me to sing the sweet chorus of ha ha he a song sweet dreams form a shade o'er my lovely infant's head sweet dreams of pleasant streams by happy silent moony beams sweet sleep with soft down weave thy brows an infant crown sweet

in heathen turk or jew where mercy love and pity dwell there god is dwelling too holy thursday 'twas on a holy thursday their innocent faces clean came children walking two and two in read and blue and green grey-headed beadles walked before with wands as white as snow till into the high dome of paul's they like thames waters flow oh what a multitude they seemed these flowers of london town seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own the hum of multitudes was there but multitudes of lambs thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands now like a mighty wild they raise to heaven the voice of song or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among beneath them sit the aged man wise guardians of the poor then cherish pity lest you drive an angel from your door night the sun descending in the west the evening star does shine the birds are silent in their nest and i must seek for mine the moon like a flower in heaven's high bower with silent delight sits and smiles on the night farewell green fields and happy grove where flocks have ta'en delight where lambs have nibbled silent move the feet of angels bright unseen they pour blessing and joy without ceasing on each bud and blossom and each sleeping bosom they look in every thoughtless nest where birds are covered warm they visit caves of every beast to keep them all from harm if they see any weeping that should have been sleeping they pour sleep on their head and sit down by their bed when wolves and tigers howl for prey they pitying stand and weep seeking to drive their thirst away and keep them from the sheep but if they rush dreadful the angels most heedful receive each mild spirit new worlds to inherit and there the lion's ruddy eyes shall flow with tears of gold and pitying the tender cries and walking round the fold saying wrath by his meekness and by his health sickness are driven away from our immortal day and now beside thee bleating lamb i can lie down and sleep or think on him who bore thy name graze after thee and weep for washed in life's river my bright mane for ever shall shine like the gold as i guard o'er the fold spring sound the flute now it's mute

shall arise and seek for her maker meek and the desert wild become a garden mild in the southern clime where the summer's prime never fades away lovely lyca lay seven summers old lovely lyca told she had wandered long hearing wild birds' song sweet sleep come to me underneath this tree do father mother weep where can lyca sleep lost in desert wild is your little child how can lyca sleep if her mother weep if her heart does ache then let lyca wake if my mother sleep lyca shall not weep frowning frowning night o'er this desert bright let thy moon arise while i close my eyes sleeping lyca lay while the beasts of prey come from caverns deep viewed the maid asleep the kingly lion stood and the virgin viewed then he gambolled round o'er the hallowed ground leopards tigers play round her as she lay while the lion old bowed his mane of gold and her breast did lick and upon her neck from his eyes of flame ruby tears there came while the lioness loosed her slender dress and naked they conveyed to caves the sleeping maid the little girl found all the night in woe lyca's parents go over valleys deep while the deserts weep tired and woe-begone hoarse with making moan arm in arm seven days they traced the desert ways seven nights they sleep among shadows deep and dream they see their child starved in desert wild pale through pathless ways the fancied image strays famished weeping weak with hollow piteous shriek rising from unrest the trembling woman presse with feet of weary woe she could no further go in his arms he bore her armed with sorrow sore till before their way a couching lion lay turning back was vain soon his heavy mane bore them to the ground then he stalked around smelling to his prey but their fears allay when he licks their hands and silent by them stands they look upon his eyes filled with deep surprise and wondering behold a spirit armed in gold on his head a crown on his shoulders down flowed his golden hair gone was all their care follow me he said weep not for the maid in my palace deep lyca lies asleep then they followed where the vision led and saw their sleeping child among tigers wild to this day they dwell in a lonely dell nor fear the wolvish howl nor the lion's growl the chimney sweeper a little black thing in the snow crying weep weep in notes of woe where are thy father and mother say -- they are both gone up to the church to pray because i was happy upon the heath and smiled among the winter's snow they clothed me in the clothes of death and taught me to sing the notes of woe and because i am happy and dance and sing they think they have done me no injury and are gone to praise god and his priest and king who make up a heaven of our misery nurse's song when voices of children are heard on the green and whisperings are in the dale the days of my youth rise fresh in my mind my face turns green and pale then come home my children the sun is gone down and the dews of night arise your spring and your day are wasted in play and your winter and night in disguise the sick rose o rose thou art sick the invisible worm that flies in the night in the howling storm has found out thy bed of crimson joy and his dark secret love does thy life destroy the fly little fly thy summer's play my thoughtless hand has brushed away am not i a fly like thee or art not thou a man like me for i dance and drink and sing till some blind hand shall brush my wing if thought is life and strength and breath and the want of thought is death then am i a happy fly if i live or if i die the angel i dreamt a dream what can it mean and that i was a maiden queen guarded by an angel mild witless woe was ne'er beguiled and i wept both night and day and he wiped my tears away and i wept both day and night and hid from him my heart's delight so he took his wings and fled then the morn blushed rosy red i dried my tears and armed my fears with ten-thousand shields and spears soon my angel came again i was armed he came in vain for the time of youth was fled and grey hairs were on my head the tiger tiger tiger burning bright in the forest of the night what immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry in what distant deeps or skies burnt the fire of thine eyes on what wings dare he aspire what the hand dare seize the fire and what shoulder and what art could twist the sinews of thy heart and when thy heart began to beat what dread hand and what dread feet what the hammer what the chain in what furnace was thy brain what the anvil what dread grasp dare its deadly terrors clasp when the stars threw down their spears and watered heaven with their tears did he smile his work to see did he who made the lamb make thee tiger tiger burning bright in the forests of the night what immortal hand or eye dare frame thy fearful symmetry my pretty rose tree a flower was offered to me such a flower as may never bore but i said i've a pretty rose tree and i passed the sweet flower o'er then i went to my pretty rose tree to tend her by day and by night but my rose turned away with jealousy and her thorns were my only delight ah sunflower ah sunflower weary of time who countest the steps of the sun seeking after that sweet golden clime where the traveller's journey is done where the youth pined away with desire and the pale virgin shrouded in snow arise from their graves and aspire where my sunflower wishes to go the lily the modest rose puts forth a thorn the humble sheep a threat'ning horn while the lily white shall in love delight nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright the garden of love i laid me down upon a bank where love lay sleeping i heard among the rushes dank weeping weeping then i went to the heath and the wild to the thistles and thorns of the waste and they told me how they were beguiled driven out and compelled to the chaste i went to the garden of love and saw what i never had seen a chapel was built in the midst where i used to play on the green and the gates of this chapel were shut and thou shalt not writ over the door so i turned to the garden of love that so many sweet flowers bore and i saw it was filled with graves and tombstones where flowers should be and priests in black gowns were walking their rounds and binding with briars my joys and desires the little vagabond dear mother dear mother the church is cold but the alehouse is healthy and pleasant and warm besides i can tell where i am used well the poor parsons with wind like a blown bladder swell but if at the church they would give us some ale and a pleasant fire our souls to regale we'd sing and we'd pray all the livelong day nor ever once wish from the church to stray then the parson might preach and drink and sing and we'd be as happy as birds in the spring and modest dame lurch who is always at church would not have bandy children nor fasting nor birch and god like a father rejoicing to see his children as pleasant and happy as he would have no more quarrel with the devil or the barrel but kiss him and give him both drink and apparel london i wandered through each chartered street near where the chartered thames does flow a mark in every face i meet marks of weakness marks of woe in every cry of every man in every infant's cry of fear in every voice in every ban the mind-forged manacles i hear how the chimney-sweeper's cry every blackening church appals and the hapless soldier's sigh runs in blood down palace-walls but most through midnight streets i hear how the youthful harlot's curse blasts the new-born infant's tear and blights with plagues the marriage-hearse the human abstract pity would be no more if we did not make somebody poor and mercy no more could be if all were as happy as we and mutual fear brings peace till the selfish loves increase then cruelty knits a snare and spreads his baits with care he sits down with his holy fears and waters the ground with tears then humility takes its root underneath his foot soon spreads the dismal shade of mystery over his head and the caterpillar and fly feed on the mystery and it bears the fruit of deceit ruddy and sweet to eat and the raven his nest has made in its thickest shade the gods of the earth and sea sought through nature to find this tree but their search was all in vain there grows one in the human brain infant sorrow my mother groaned my father wept into the dangerous world i leapt helpless naked piping loud like a fiend hid in a cloud struggling in my father's hands striving against my swaddling-bands bound and weary i thought best to sulk upon my mother's breast a poison tree i was angry with my friend i told my wrath my wrath did end i was angry with my foe i told it not my wrath did grow and i watered it in fears night and morning with my tears and i sunned it with smiles and with soft deceitful wiles and it grew both day and night till it bore an apple bright and my foe beheld it shine and he knew that it was mine -- and into my garden stole when the night had veiled the pole in the morning glad i see my foe outstretched beneath the tree a little boy lost nought loves another as itself nor venerates another so nor is it possible to thought a greater than itself to know and father how can i love you or any of my brothers more i love you like the little bird that picks up crumbs around the door the priest sat by and heard the child in trembling zeal he seized his hair he led him by his little coat and all admired the priestly care and standing on the altar high lo what a fiend is here said he one who sets reason up for judge of our most holy mystery the weeping child could not be heard the weeping parents wept in vain they stripped him to his little shirt and bound him in an iron chain and burned him in a holy place where many had been burned before the weeping parents wept in vain are such thing done on albion's shore a little girl lost children of the future age reading this indignant page know that in a former time love sweet love was thought a crime in the age of gold free from winter's cold youth and maiden bright to the holy light naked in the sunny beams delight once a youthful pair filled with softest care met in garden bright where the holy light had just removed the curtains of the night then in rising day on the grass they play parents were afar strangers came not near and the maiden soon forgot her fear tired with kisses sweet they agree to meet when the silent sleep waves o'er heaven's deep and the weary tired wanderers weep to her father white came the maiden bright but his loving look like the holy book all her tender limbs with terror shook ona pale and weak to thy father speak oh the trembling fear oh the dismal care that shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair the schoolboy i love to rise on a summer morn when birds are singing on every tree the distant huntsman winds his horn and the skylark sings with me oh what sweet company but to go to school in a summer morn -- oh it drives all joy away under a cruel eye outworn the little ones spend the day in sighing and dismay ah then at times i drooping sit and spend many an anxious hour nor in my book can i take delight nor sit in learning's bower worn through with the dreary shower how can the bird that is born for joy sit in a cage and sing how can a child when fears annoy but droop his tender wing and forget his youthful spring oh father and mother if buds are nipped and blossoms blown away and if the tender plants are stripped of their joy in the springing day by sorrow and care's dismay -- how shall the summer arise in joy or the summer fruits appear or how shall we gather what griefs destroy or bless the mellowing year when the blasts of winter appear to terzah whate'er is born of mortal birth must be consumed with the earth to rise from generation free then what have i to do with thee the sexes sprang from shame and pride blown in the morn in evening died but mercy changed death into sleep the sexes rose to work and weep thou mother of my mortal part with cruelty didst mould my heart and with false self-deceiving tears didst bind my nostrils eyes and ears didst close my tongue in senseless clay and me to

down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again 'dinah'll miss me very much to-night i should think ' dinah was the cat 'i hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air i'm afraid but you might catch a bat and that's very like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder ' and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way 'do cats eat bats do cats eat bats ' and sometimes 'do bats eat cats ' for you see as she couldn't answer either question it didn't much matter which way she put it she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly 'now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat ' when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over,0,0,0.06811247329223408
alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner 'oh my ears and whiskers how late it's getting ' she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof,0,0,0.04044747225741315
there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it 'which certainly was not here before ' said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words 'drink me' beautifully printed on it in large letters,0,0,0.10453985827046698
after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried,0,0,0.33789599442408974
alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking 'dear dear how queer everything is to-day and yesterday things went on just as usual i wonder if i've been changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different but if i'm not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah that's the great puzzle ' and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them,0,0,0.38743059558106663
as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea 'and in that case i can go back by railway ' she said to herself alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high,0,0,0.0820236782128469
just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself,0,0,0.35736053282779356

'well perhaps not ' said alice in a soothing tone 'don't be angry about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her she is such a dear quiet thing ' alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her face -- and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse -- and she's such a capital one for catching mice -- oh i beg your pardon ' cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended 'we won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not ',0,0,0.17671744340469406
at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out 'sit down all of you and listen to me i'll soon make you dry enough ' they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon,0,0,0.16675989055572368

this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking 'i really must be getting home the night-air doesn't suit my throat ' and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children 'come away my dears it's high time you were all in bed ' on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone,0,0,0.07789118320610251
it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself 'the duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers she'll get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder ' alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seen -- everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely,0,0,0.036449384088634317

'mary ann mary ann ' said the voice 'fetch me my gloves this moment ' then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it,0,0,0.2491132977698137

there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as 'sure i don't like it yer honour at all at all ' 'do as i tell you you coward ' and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass 'what a number of cucumber-frames there must be ' thought alice 'i wonder what they'll do next as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could i'm sure i don't want to stay in here any longer ',0,0,0.08847416957608027
she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words 'where's the other ladder -- why i hadn't to bring but one bill's got the other -- bill fetch it here lad -- here put 'em up at this corner -- no tie 'em together first -- they don't reach half high enough yet -- oh they'll do well enough don't be particular -- here bill catch hold of this rope -- will the roof bear -- mind that loose slate -- oh it's coming down heads below ' a loud crash -- 'now who did that -- it was bill i fancy -- who's to go down the chimney -- nay i shan't you do it -- that i won't then -- bill's to go down -- here bill the master says you're to go down the chimney ',0,0,0.0271987031334019

for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood -- she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fish -- and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads she felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen,0,0,0.07282952266605876

the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all 'but perhaps it was only sobbing ' she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears,0,0,0.09992692403939375

i begin to understand one or two of your dogmas mr turnbull he had said emphatically as they ploughed heavily up a wooded hill and every one that i understand i deny take any one of them you like you hold that your heretics and sceptics have helped the world forward and handed on a lamp of progress i deny it nothing is plainer from real history than that each of your heretics invented a complete cosmos of his own which the next heretic smashed entirely to pieces who knows now exactly what nestorius taught who cares there are only two things that we know for certain about it the first is that nestorius as a heretic taught something quite opposite to the teaching of arius the heretic who came before him and something quite useless to james turnbull the heretic who comes after i defy you to go back to the free-thinkers of the past and find any habitation for yourself at all i defy you to read godwin or shelley or the deists of the eighteenth century of the nature-worshipping humanists of the renaissance without discovering that you differ from them twice as much as you differ from the pope you are a nineteenth-century sceptic and you are always telling me that i ignore the cruelty of nature if you had been an eighteenth-century sceptic you would have told me that i ignore the kindness and benevolence of nature you are an atheist and you praise the deists of the eighteenth century read them instead of praising them and you will find that their whole universe stands or falls with the deity you are a materialist and you think bruno a scientific hero see what he said and you will think him an insane mystic no the great free-thinker with his genuine ability and honesty does not in practice destroy christianity what he does destroy is the free-thinker who went before free-thought may be suggestive it may be inspiriting it may have as much as you please of the merits that come from vivacity and variety but there is one thing free-thought can never be by any possibility -- free-thought can never be progressive it can never be progressive because it will accept nothing from the past it begins every time again from the beginning and it goes every time in a different direction all the rational philosophers have gone along different roads so it is impossible to say which has gone farthest who can discuss whether emerson was a better optimist than schopenhauer was pessimist it is like asking if this corn is as yellow as that hill is steep no there are only two things that really progress and they both accept accumulations of authority they may be progressing uphill and down they may be growing steadily better or steadily worse but they have steadily increased in certain definable matters they have steadily advanced in a certain definable direction they are the only two things it seems that ever can progress the first is strictly physical science the second is the catholic church,0,0,0.08416658270909683
we once did make it a test for these things said macian smiling and then you told us that we were imposing by force a faith unsupported by argument it seems rather hard that having first been told that our creed must be false because we did use tests we should now be told that it must be false because we don't but i notice that most anti-christian arguments are in the same inconsistent style,0,0,0.1451174016476623

this figure was clad in tweeds of a piebald check with a pink tie a sharp collar and protuberant yellow boots he contrived in the true tradition of 'arry at margate to look at once startling and commonplace but as the cockney apparition drew nearer muscari was astounded to observe that the head was distinctly different from the body it was an italian head fuzzy swarthy and very vivacious that rose abruptly out of the standing collar like cardboard and the comic pink tie in fact it was a head he knew he recognized it above all the dire erection of english holiday array as the face of an old but forgotten friend name ezza this youth had been a prodigy at college and european fame was promised him when he was barely fifteen but when he appeared in the world he failed first publicly as a dramatist and a demagogue and then privately for years on end as an actor a traveller a commission agent or a journalist muscari had known him last behind the footlights he was but too well attuned to the excitements of that profession and it was believed that some moral calamity had swallowed him up,0,0,0.06960925293101702

father brown was walking home from mass on a white weird morning when the mists were slowly lifting -- one of those mornings when the very element of light appears as something mysterious and new the scattered trees outlined themselves more and more out of the vapour as if they were first drawn in grey chalk and then in charcoal at yet more distant intervals appeared the houses upon the broken fringe of the suburb their outlines became clearer and clearer until he recognized many in which he had chance acquaintances and many more the names of whose owners he knew but all the windows and doors were sealed none of the people were of the sort that would be up at such a time or still less on such an errand but as he passed under the shadow of one handsome villa with verandas and wide ornate gardens he heard a noise that made him almost involuntarily stop it was the unmistakable noise of a pistol or carbine or some light firearm discharged but it was not this that puzzled him most the first full noise was immediately followed by a series of fainter noises -- as he counted them about six he supposed it must be the echo but the odd thing was that the echo was not in the least like the original sound it was not like anything else that he could think of the three things nearest to it seemed to be the noise made by siphons of soda-water one of the many noises made by an animal and the noise made by a person attempting to conceal laughter none of which seemed to make much sense,0,0,0.07960671270599784
half-way down one side of the house stood out a projection like a very low shed it was as he afterwards discovered a large dustbin round the corner of this came a figure at first a mere shadow in the haze apparently bending and peering about then coming nearer it solidified into a figure that was indeed rather unusually solid major putnam was a bald-headed bull-necked man short and very broad with one of those rather apoplectic faces that are produced by a prolonged attempt to combine the oriental climate with the occidental luxuries but the face was a good-humoured one and even now though evidently puzzled and inquisitive wore a kind of innocent grin he had a large palm-leaf hat on the back of his head suggesting a halo that was by no means appropriate to the face but otherwise he was clad only in a very vivid suit of striped scarlet and yellow pyjamas which though glowing enough to behold must have been on a fresh morning pretty chilly to wear he had evidently come out of his house in a hurry and the priest was not surprised when he called out without further ceremony did you hear that noise,0,0,0.03550882314494306

when gregory heard the dangerous dialogue end with a sudden safety for his rival he rose abruptly and paced the floor in painful thought he was indeed in an agony of diplomacy it was clear that syme's inspired impudence was likely to bring him out of all merely accidental dilemmas little was to be hoped from them he could not himself betray syme partly from honour but partly also because if he betrayed him and for some reason failed to destroy him the syme who escaped would be a syme freed from all obligation of secrecy a syme who would simply walk to the nearest police station after all it was only one night's discussion and only one detective who would know of it he would let out as little as possible of their plans that night and then let syme go and chance it,0,0,0.057530353593731584

comrades began gregory in a low but penetrating voice it is not necessary for me to tell you what is my policy for it is your policy also our belief has been slandered it has been disfigured it has been utterly confused and concealed but it has never been altered those who talk about anarchism and its dangers go everywhere and anywhere to get their information except to us except to the fountain head they learn about anarchists from sixpenny novels they learn about anarchists from tradesmen's newspapers they learn about anarchists from ally sloper's half-holiday and the sporting times they never learn about anarchists from anarchists we have no chance of denying the mountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from one end of europe to another the man who has always heard that we are walking plagues has never heard our reply i know that he will not hear it tonight though my passion were to rend the roof for it is deep deep under the earth that the persecuted are permitted to assemble as the christians assembled in the catacombs but if by some incredible accident there were here tonight a man who all his life had thus immensely misunderstood us i would put this question to him 'when those christians met in those catacombs what sort of moral reputation had they in the streets above what tales were told of their atrocities by one educated roman to another suppose' i would say to him 'suppose that we are only repeating that still mysterious paradox of history suppose we seem as shocking as the christians because we are really as harmless as the christians suppose we seem as mad as the christians because we are really as meek ',0,0,0.05858272126580446

they paused for a few minutes only to stuff down coffee and coarse thick sandwiches at a coffee stall and then made their way across the river which under the grey and growing light looked as desolate as acheron they reached the bottom of the huge block of buildings which they had seen from across the river and began in silence to mount the naked and numberless stone steps only pausing now and then to make short remarks on the rail of the banisters at about every other flight they passed a window each window showed them a pale and tragic dawn lifting itself laboriously over london from each the innumerable roofs of slate looked like the leaden surges of a grey troubled sea after rain syme was increasingly conscious that his new adventure had somehow a quality of cold sanity worse than the wild adventures of the past last night for instance the tall tenements had seemed to him like a tower in a dream as he now went up the weary and perpetual steps he was daunted and bewildered by their almost infinite series but it was not the hot horror of a dream or of anything that might be exaggeration or delusion their infinity was more like the empty infinity of arithmetic something unthinkable yet necessary to thought or it was like the stunning statements of astronomy about the distance of the fixed stars he was ascending the house of reason a thing more hideous than unreason itself,0,0,0.012917806480694257

the parent's assistant by maria edgeworth the orphans near the ruins of the castle of rossmore in ireland is a small cabin in which there once lived a widow and her four children as long as she was able to work she was very industrious and was accounted the best spinner in the parish but she overworked herself at last and fell ill so that she could not sit to her wheel as she used to do and was obliged to give it up to her eldest daughter mary mary was at this time about twelve years old one evening she was sitting at the foot of her mother's bed spinning and her little brothers and sisters were gathered round the fire eating their potatoes and milk for supper bless them the poor young creatures said the widow who as she lay on her bed which she knew must be her deathbed was thinking of what would become of her children after she was gone mary stopped her wheel for she was afraid that the noise of it had wakened her mother and would hinder her from going to sleep again no need to stop the wheel mary dear for me said her mother i was not asleep nor is it that which keeps me from sleep but don't overwork yourself mary oh no fear of that replied mary i'm strong and hearty so was i once said her mother and so you will be again i hope said mary when the fine weather comes again the fine weather will never come again to me said her mother 'tis a folly mary to hope for that but what i hope is that you'll find some friend -- some help -- orphans as you'll soon all of you be and one thing comforts my heart even as i am lying here that not a soul in the wide world i am leaving has to complain of me though poor i have lived honest and i have brought you up to be the same mary and i am sure the little ones will take after you for you'll be good to them -- as good to them as you can here the children who had finished eating their suppers came round the bed to listen to what their mother was saying she was tired of speaking for she was very weak but she took their little hands as they laid them on the bed and joining them all together she said bless you dears bless you love and help one another all you can good night -- good-bye mary took the children away to their bed for she saw that their mother was too ill to say more but mary did not herself know how ill she was her mother never spoke rightly afterwards but talked in a confused way about some debts and one in particular which she owed to a schoolmistress for mary's schooling and then she charged mary to go and pay it because she was not able to go in with it at the end of the week she was dead and buried and the orphans were left alone in their cabin the two youngest girls peggy and nancy were six and seven years old edmund was not yet nine but he was a stout-grown healthy boy and well disposed to work he had been used to bring home turf from the bog on his back to lead cart-horses and often to go on errands for gentlemen's families who paid him a sixpence or a shilling according to the distance which he went so that edmund by some or other of these little employments was as he said likely enough to earn his bread and he told mary to have a good heart for that he should every year grow able to do more and more and that he should never forget his mother's words when she last gave him her blessing and joined their hands all together as for peggy and nancy it was little that they could do but they were good children and mary when she considered that so much depended upon her was resolved to exert herself to the utmost her first care was to pay those debts which her mother had mentioned to her for which she left money done up carefully in separate papers when all these were paid away there was not enough left to pay both the rent of the cabin and a year's schooling for herself and sisters which was due to the schoolmistress in a neighbouring village mary was in hopes that the rent would not be called for immediately but in this she was disappointed mr harvey the gentleman on whose estate she lived was in england and in his absence all was managed by a mr hopkins an agent who was a hard man the driver came to mary about a week after her mother's death and told her that the rent must be brought in the next day and that she must leave the cabin for a new tenant was coming into it that she was too young to have a house to herself and that the only thing she had to do was to get some neighbour to take her and her brother and her sisters in for charity's sake a hard-hearted man the driver finished by hinting that she would not be so hardly used if she had not brought upon herself the ill-will of miss alice the agent's daughter mary it is true had refused to give miss alice a goat upon which she had set her fancy but this was the only offence of which she had been guilty and at the time she refused it her mother wanted the goat's milk which was the only thing she then liked to drink mary went immediately to mr hopkins the agent to pay her rent and she begged of him to let her stay another year in her cabin but this he refused it was now september 25th and he said that the new tenant must come in on the 29th so that she must quit it directly mary could not bear the thoughts of begging any of the neighbours to take her and her brother and sisters in for charity's sake for the neighbours were all poor enough themselves so she bethought herself that she might find shelter in the ruins of the old castle of rossmore where she and her brother in better times had often played at hide and seek the kitchen and two other rooms near it were yet covered in tolerably well and a little thatch she thought would make them comfortable through the winter the agent consented to let her and her brother and sisters go in there upon her paying him half a guinea in hand and promising to pay the same yearly into these lodgings the orphans now removed taking with them two bedsteads a stool chair and a table a sort of press which contained what little clothes they had and a chest in which they had two hundred of meal the chest was carried for them by some of the charitable neighbours who likewise added to their scanty stock of potatoes and turf what would make it last through the winter these children were well thought of and pitied because their mother was known to have been all her life honest and industrious sure says one of the neighbours we can do no less than give a helping hand to the poor orphans that are so ready to help themselves so one helped to thatch the room in which they were to sleep and another took their cow to graze upon his bit of land on condition of having half the milk and one and all said they should be welcome to take share of their potatoes and buttermilk if they should find their own ever fall short the half-guinea which mr hopkins the agent required for letting mary into the castle was part of what she had to pay to the schoolmistress to whom above a guinea was due mary went to her and took her goat along with her and offered it in part of payment of the debt but the schoolmistress would not receive the goat she said that she could afford to wait for her money till mary was able to pay it that she knew her to be an honest industrious little girl and she would trust her with more than a guinea mary thanked her and she was glad to take the goat home again as she was very fond of it being now settled in their house they went every day regularly to work maud spun nine cuts a day besides doing all that was to be done in the house edmund got fourpence a day by his work and peggy and annie earned twopence apiece at the paper-mills near navan where they were employed to sort rags and to cut them into small pieces when they had done work one day annie went to the master of the paper- mill and asked him if she might have two sheets of large white paper which were lying on the press she offered a penny for the paper but the master would not take anything from her but gave her the paper when he found that she wanted it to make a garland for her mother's grave annie and peggy cut out the garland and mary when it was finished went along with them and edmund to put it up it was just a month after their mother's death it happened at the time the orphans were putting up this garland that two young ladies who were returning home after their evening walk stopped at the gate of the churchyard to look at the red light which the setting sun cast upon the window of the church as the ladies were standing at the gate they heard a voice near them crying o mother mother are you gone for ever they could not see anyone so they walked softly round to the other side of the church and there they saw mary kneeling beside a grave on which her brothers and sisters were hanging their white garlands the children all stood still when they saw the two ladies passing near them but mary did not know anybody was passing for her face was hid in her hands isabella and caroline so these ladies were called would not disturb the poor children but they stopped in the village to inquire about them it was at the house of the schoolmistress that they stopped and she gave them a good account of these orphans she particularly commended mary's honesty in having immediately paid all her mother's debts to the utmost farthing as far as her money would go she told the ladies how mary had been turned out of her house and how she had offered her goat of which she was very fond to discharge a debt due for her schooling and in short the schoolmistress who had known mary for several years spoke so well of her that these ladies resolved that they would go to the old castle of rossmore to see her the next day when they went there they found the room in which the children lived as clean and neat as such a ruined place could be made edmund was out working with a farmer mary was spinning and her little sisters were measuring out some bogberries of which they had gathered a basketful for sale isabella after telling mary what an excellent character she had heard of her inquired what it was she most wanted and mary said that she had just worked up all her flax and she was most in want of more flax for her wheel isabella promised that she would send her a fresh supply of flax and caroline bought the bogberries from the little girls and gave them money enough to buy a pound of coarse cotton for knitting as mary said that she could teach them how to knit the supply of flax which isabella sent the next day was of great service to mary as it kept her in employment for above a month and when she sold the yarn which she had spun with it she had money enough to buy some warm flannel for winter wear besides spinning well she had learned at school to do plain work tolerably neatly and isabella and caroline employed her to work for them by which she earned a great deal more than she could by spinning at her leisure hours she taught her sisters to read and write and edmund with part of the money which he earned by his work out of doors paid a schoolmaster for teaching him a little arithmetic when the winter nights came on he used to light his rush candles for mary to work by he had gathered and stripped a good provision of rushes in the month of august and a neighbour gave him grease to dip them in one evening just as he had lighted his candles a footman came in who was sent by isabella with some plain work to mary this servant was an englishman and he was but newly come over to ireland the rush candles caught his attention for he had never seen any of them before as he came from a part of england where they were not used edmund who was ready to oblige and proud that his candles were noticed showed the englishman how they were made and gave him a bundle of rushes the proper species of rush says white in his 'natural history of selborne ' seems to be the juncus effusus or common soft rush which is to be found in moist pastures by the sides of streams and under hedges these rushes are in best condition in the height of summer but may be gathered so as to serve the purpose well quite on to autumn the largest and longest are the best decayed labourers women and children make it their business to procure and prepare them as soon as they are cut they must be flung into water and kept there for otherwise they will dry and shrink and the peel will not run when these junci are thus far prepared they must lie out on the grass to be bleached and take the dew for some nights and afterwards be dried in the sun some address is required in dipping these rushes in the scalding fat or grease but this knack is also to be attained by practice a pound of common grease may be procured for fourpence and about six pounds of grease will dip a pound of rushes and one pound of rushes may be bought for one shilling so that a pound of rushes medicated and ready for use will cost three shillings the servant was pleased with his good nature in this trifling instance and remembered it long after it was forgotten by edmund whenever his master wanted to send a messenger anywhere gilbert for that was the servant's name always employed his little friend edmund whom upon further acquaintance he liked better and better he found that edmund was both quick and exact in executing commissions one day after he had waited a great while at a gentleman's house for an answer to a letter he was so impatient to get home that he ran off without it when he was questioned by gilbert why he did not bring an answer he did not attempt to make any excuse he did not say there was no answer please your honour or they bid me not to wait etc but he told exactly the truth and though gilbert scolded him for being so impatient as not to wait yet his telling the truth was more to the boy's advantage than any excuse he could have made after this he was always believed when he said there was no answer or they bid me not wait for gilbert knew that he would not tell a lie to save himself from being scolded the orphans continued to assist one another in their work according to their strength and abilities and they went on in this manner for three years with what mary got by her spinning and plain work and edmund by leading of cart-horses going on errands etc and with little peggy and anne's earnings the family contrived to live comfortably isabella and caroline often visited them and sometimes gave them clothes and sometimes flax or cotton for their spinning and knitting and these children did not expect that because the ladies did something for them they should do everything they did not grow idle or wasteful when edmund was about twelve years old his friend gilbert sent for him one day and told him that his master had given him leave to have a boy in the house to assist him and that his master told him he might choose one in the neighbourhood several were anxious to get into such a good place but gilbert said that he preferred edmund before them all because he knew him to be an industrious honest good natured lad who always told the truth so edmund went into service at the vicarage and his master was the father of isabella and caroline he found his new way of life very pleasant for he was well fed well clothed and well treated and he every day learned more of his business in which at first he was rather awkward he was mindful to do all that mr gilbert required of him and he was so obliging to all his fellow-servants that they could not help liking him but there was one thing which was at first rather disagreeable to him he was obliged to wear shoes and stockings and they hurt his feet besides this when he waited at dinner he made such a noise in walking that his fellow-servants laughed at him he told his sister mary of his distress and she made for him after many trials a pair of cloth shoes with soles of platted hemp in these he could walk without making the least noise and as these shoes could not be worn out of doors he was always sure to change them before he went out and consequently he had always clean shoes to wear in the house the author has seen a pair of shoes such as here described made in a few hours it was soon remarked by the men-servants that he had left off clumping so heavily and it was observed by the maids that he never dirtied the stairs or passages with his shoes when he was praised for these things he said it was his sister mary who should be thanked and not he and he showed the shoes which she had made for him isabella's maid bespoke a pair immediately and sent mary a piece of pretty calico for the outside the last-maker made a last for her and over this mary sewed the calico vamps tight her brother advised her to try platted packthread instead of hemp for the soles and she found that this looked more neat than the hemp soles and was likely to last longer she platted the packthread together in strands of about half an inch thick and these were served firmly together at the bottom of the shoe when they were finished they fitted well and the maid showed them to her mistress isabella and caroline were so well pleased with mary's ingenuity and kindness to her brother that they bespoke from her two dozen of these shoes and gave her three yards of coloured fustian to make them of and galloon for the binding when the shoes were completed isabella and caroline disposed of them for her amongst their acquaintance and got three shillings a pair for them the young ladies as soon as they had collected the money walked to the old castle where they found everything neat and clean as usual they had great pleasure in giving to this industrious girl the reward of her ingenuity which she received with some surprise and more gratitude they advised her to continue the shoemaking trade as they found the shoes were liked and they knew that they could have a sale for them at the repository in dublin mary encouraged by these kind friends went on with her little manufacture with increased activity peggy and anne platted the packthread and basted the vamps and linings together ready for her edmund was allowed to come home for an hour every morning provided he was back again before eight o'clock it was summer time and he got up early because he liked to go home to see his sisters and he took his share in the manufactory it was his business to hammer the soles flat and as soon as he came home every morning he performed his task with so much cheerfulness and sang so merrily at his work that the hour of his arrival was always an hour of joy to the family mary had presently employment enough upon her hands orders came to her for shoes from many families in the neighbourhood and she could not get them finished fast enough she however in the midst of her hurry found time to make a very pretty pair with neat roses as a present for her schoolmistress who now that she saw her pupil in a good way of business consented to receive the amount of her old debt several of the children who went to her school were delighted with the sight of mary's present and went to the little manufactory at rossmore castle to find out how these shoes were made some went from curiosity others from idleness but when they saw how happy the little shoemakers seemed whilst busy at work they longed to take some share in what was going forward one begged mary to let her plat some packthread for the soles another helped peggy and anne to baste in the linings and all who could get employment were pleased for the idle ones were shoved out of the way it became a custom with the children of the village to resort to the old castle at their play hours and it was surprising to see how much was done by ten or twelve of them each doing but a little at a time one morning edmund and the little manufacturers were assembled very early and they were busy at their work all sitting round the meal chest which served them for a table my hands must be washed said george a little boy who came running in i ran so fast that i might be in time to go to work along with you all that i tumbled down and look how i have dirtied my hands most haste worst speed my hands must be washed before i can do anything whilst george was washing his hands two other little children who had just finished their morning's work came to him to beg that he would blow some soap bubbles for them and they were all three eagerly blowing bubbles and watching them mount into the air when suddenly they were startled by a noise as loud as thunder they were in a sort of outer court of the castle next to the room in which all their companions were at work and they ran precipitately into the room exclaiming did you hear that noise i thought i heard a clap of thunder said mary but why do you look so frightened as she finished speaking another and a louder noise and the walls round about them shook the children turned pale and stood motionless but edmund threw down his hammer and ran out to see what was the matter mary followed him and they saw that a great chimney of the old ruins at the farthest side of the castle had fallen down and this was the cause of the prodigious noise the part of the castle in which they lived seemed as edmund said to be perfectly safe but the children of the village were terrified and thinking that the whole would come tumbling down directly they ran to their homes as fast as they could edmund who was a courageous lad and proud of showing his courage laughed at their cowardice but mary who was very prudent persuaded her brother to ask an experienced mason who was building at his master's to come and give his opinion whether their part of the castle was safe to live in or not the mason came and gave it as his opinion that the rooms they inhabited might last through the winter but that no part of the ruins could stand another year mary was sorry to leave a place of which she had grown fond poor as it was having lived in it in peace and contentment ever since her mother's death which was now nearly four years but she determined to look out for some other place to live in and she had now money enough to pay the rent of a comfortable cabin without losing any time she went to the village that was at the end of the avenue leading to the vicarage for she wished to get a lodging in this village because it was so near to her brother and to the ladies who had been so kind to her she found that there was one newly built house in this village unoccupied it belonged to mr harvey her landlord who was still in england it was slated and neatly fitted up inside but the rent of it was six guineas a year and this was far above what mary could afford to pay three guineas a year she thought was the highest rent for which she could venture to engage besides she heard that several proposals had been made to mr harvey for this house and she knew that mr hopkins the agent was not her friend therefore she despaired of getting it there was no other to be had in this village her brother was still more vexed than she was that she could not find a place near him he offered to give a guinea yearly towards the rent out of his wages and mr gilbert spoke about it for him to the steward and inquired whether amongst any of those who had given in proposals there might not be one who would be content with a part of the house and who would join with mary in paying the rent none could be found but a woman who was a great scold and a man who was famous for going to law about every trifle with his neighbours mary did not choose to have anything to do with these people she did not like to speak either to miss isabella or caroline about it because she was not of an encroaching temper and when they had done so much for her she would have been ashamed to beg for more she returned home to the old castle mortified that she had no good news to tell anne and peggy who she knew expected to hear that she had found a nice house for them in the village near their brother bad news for you peggy cried she as soon as she got home and bad news for you mary replied her sisters who looked very sorrowful what's the matter your poor goat is dead replied peggy there she is yonder lying under the great corner stone you can just see her leg we cannot lift the stone from off her it is so heavy betsy one of the neighbour's girls says she remembers when she came to us to work early this morning she saw the goat rubbing itself and butting with its horns against that old tottering chimney many's the time said mary that i have driven the poor thing away from that place i was always afraid she would shake that great ugly stone down upon her at last the goat who had long been the favourite of mary and her sisters was lamented by them all when edmund came he helped them to move the great stone from off the poor animal who was crushed so as to be a terrible sight as they were moving away this stone in order to bury the goat anne found an odd-looking piece of money which seemed neither like a halfpenny nor a shilling nor a guinea here are more a great many more of them cried peggy and upon searching amongst the rubbish they discovered a small iron pot which seemed as if it had been filled with these coins as a vast number of them were found about the spot where it fell on examining these coins edmund thought that several of them looked like gold and the girls exclaimed with great joy -- oh mary mary this is come to us just in right time -- now you can pay for the slated house never was anything so lucky but mary though nothing could have pleased her better than to have been able to pay for the house observed that they could not honestly touch any of this treasure as it belonged to the owner of the castle edmund agreed with her that they ought to carry it all immediately to mr hopkins the agent peggy and anne were convinced by what mary said and they begged to go along with her and their brother to take the coins to mr hopkins on their way they stopped at the vicarage to show the treasure to mr gilbert who took it to the young ladies isabella and caroline and told them how it had been found it is not only by their superior riches but it is yet more by their superior knowledge that persons in the higher rank of life may assist those in a lower condition isabella who had some knowledge of chemistry discovered by touching the coins with nitric acid that several of them were of gold and consequently of great value caroline also found out that many of the coins were very valuable as curiosities she recollected her father's having shown to her the prints of the coins at the end of each king's reign in rapin's history of england and upon comparing these impressions with the coins found by the orphans she perceived that many of them were of the reign of henry the seventh which from their scarcity were highly appreciated by numismatic collectors isabella and caroline knowing something of the character of mr hopkins the agent had the precaution to count the coins and to mark each of them with a cross so small that it was scarcely visible to the naked eye though it was easily to be seen through a magnifying glass they also begged that their father who was well acquainted with mr harvey the gentleman to whom rossmore castle belonged to write to him and tell him how well these orphans had behaved about the treasure which they had found the value of the coins was estimated at about thirty or forty guineas a few days after the fall of the chimney at rossmore castle as mary and her sisters were sitting at their work there came hobbling in an old woman leaning on a crab stick that seemed to have been newly cut she had a broken tobacco-pipe in her mouth her head was wrapped up in two large red and blue handkerchiefs with their crooked corners hanging far down over the back of her neck no shoes on her broad feet nor stockings on her many-coloured legs her petticoat was jagged at the bottom and the skirt of her gown turned up over her shoulders to serve instead of a cloak which she had sold for whisky this old woman was well known amongst the country people by the name of goody grope because she had for many years been in the habit of groping in old castles and in moats and at the bottom of a round tower in the neighbourhood in search of treasure in her youth she had heard someone talking in a whisper of an old prophecy found in a bog which said that before many st patrick's days should come about there would be found a treasure under ground by one within twenty miles round this prophecy made a deep impression upon her she also dreamed of it three times and as the dream she thought was a sure token that the prophecy was to come true she from that time forwards gave up her spinning-wheel and her knitting and could think of nothing but hunting for the treasure that was to be found by one within twenty miles round goody is not a word used in ireland collyogh is the irish appellation of an old woman but as collyogh might sound strangely to english ears we have translated it by the word goody what are in ireland called moats are in england called danish mounds or barrows near kells in ireland there is a round tower which was in imminent danger of being pulled down by an old woman's rooting at its foundation in hopes of finding treasure year after year st patrick's day came about without her ever finding a farthing by all her groping and as she was always idle she grew poorer and poorer besides to comfort herself for her disappointments and to give her spirits for fresh searches she took to drinking she sold all she had by degrees but still she fancied that the lucky day would come sooner or later that would pay for all goody grope however reached her sixtieth year without ever seeing this lucky day and now in her old age she was a beggar without a house to shelter her a bed to lie on or food to put into her mouth but what she begged from the charity of those who had trusted more than she had to industry and less to luck ah mary honey give me a potato and a sup of something for the love o' mercy for not a bit have i had all day except half a glass of whisky and a halfpenny worth of tobacco mary immediately set before her some milk and picked a good potato out of the bowl for her she was sorry to see such an old woman in such a wretched condition goody grope said she would rather have spirits of some kind or other than milk but mary had no spirits to give her so she sat herself down close to the fire and after she had sighed and groaned and smoked for some time she said to mary well and what have you done with the treasure you had the luck to find mary told her that she had carried it to mr hopkins the agent that's not what i would have done in your place replied the old woman when good luck came to you what a shame to turn your back upon it but it is idle talking of what's done -- that's past but i'll try my luck in this here castle before next st patrick's day comes about i was told it was more than twenty miles from our bog or i would have been here long ago but better late than never mary was much alarmed and not without reason at this speech for she knew that if goody grope once set to work at the foundation of the old castle of rossmore she would soon bring it all down it was in vain to talk to goody grope of the danger of burying herself under the ruins or of the improbability of her meeting with another pot of gold coins she set her elbow upon her knees and stopping her ears with her hands bid mary and her sisters not to waste their breath advising their elders for that let them say what they would she would fall to work the next morning barring you'll make it worth my while to let it alone and what will make it worth your while to let it alone said mary for she saw that she must either get into a quarrel or give up her habitation or comply with the conditions of this provoking old woman half a crown goody grope said was the least she could be content to take mary paid the half-crown and was in hopes that she had got rid for ever of her tormentor but she was mistaken for scarcely was the week at an end before the old woman appeared before her again and repeated her threats of falling to work the next morning unless she had something given to her to buy tobacco the next day and the next and the next goody grope came on the same errand and poor mary who could ill-afford to supply her constantly with halfpence at last exclaimed i am sure the finding of this treasure has not been any good luck to us but quite the contrary and i wish we never had found it mary did not yet know how much she was to suffer on account of this unfortunate pot of gold coins mr hopkins the agent imagined that no one knew of the discovery of this treasure but himself and these poor children so not being as honest as they were he resolved to keep it for his own use he was surprised some weeks afterwards to receive a letter from his employer mr harvey demanding from him the coins which had been discovered at rossmore castle hopkins had sold the gold coins and some of the others and he flattered himself that the children and the young ladies to whom he now found they had been shown could not tell whether what they had seen were gold or not and he was not in the least apprehensive that those of henry the seventh's reign should be reclaimed from him as he thought they had escaped attention so he sent over the silver coins and others of little value and apologized for his not having mentioned them before by saying that he considered them as mere rubbish mr harvey in reply observed that he could not consider as rubbish the gold coins which were amongst them when they were discovered and he inquired why these gold coins and those of the reign of henry the seventh were not now sent to him mr hopkins denied that he had ever received any such but he was thunderstruck when mr harvey in reply to this falsehood sent him a list of the coins which the orphans had deposited with him and exact drawings of those that were missing he informed him that this list and these drawings came from two ladies who had seen the coins in question mr hopkins thought that he had no means of escape but by boldly persisting in falsehood he replied that it was very likely such coins had been found at rossmore castle and that the ladies alluded to had probably seen them but he positively declared that they never came to his hands that he had restored all that were deposited with him and that as to the others he supposed they must have been taken out of the pot by the children or by edmund or mary on their way from the ladies' house to his the orphans were shocked and astonished when they heard from isabella and caroline the charge that was made against them they looked at one another in silence for some moments then peggy exclaimed -- sure mr hopkins has forgotten himself strangely does not he remember edmund's counting the things to him upon the great table in his hall and we all standing by i remember it as well as if it was this instant and so do i cried anne and don't you recollect mary your picking out the gold ones and telling mr hopkins that they were gold and he said you knew nothing of the matter and i was going to tell him that miss isabella had tried them and knew that they were gold but just then there came in some tenants to pay their rent and he pushed us out and twitched from my hand the piece of gold which i had taken up to show him the bright spot which miss isabella had cleaned by the stuff that she had poured on it i believe he was afraid i should steal it he twitched it from my hand in such a hurry do edmund do mary -- let us go to him and put him in mind of all this i'll go to him no more said edmund sturdily he is a bad man -- i'll never go to him again mary don't be cast down -- we have no need to be cast down -- we are honest true said mary but is not it a hard case that we who have lived as my mother did all her life before us in peace and honesty with all the world should now have our good name taken from us when -- mary's voice faltered and stopped it can't be taken from us cried edmund poor orphans though we are and he a rich gentleman as he calls himself let him say and do what he will he can't hurt our good name edmund was mistaken alas and mary had but too much reason for her fears the affair was a great deal talked of and the agent spared no pains to have the story told his own way the orphans conscious of their own innocence took no pains about the matter and the consequence was that all who knew them well had no doubt of their honesty but many who knew nothing of them concluded that the agent must be in the right and the children in the wrong the buzz of scandal went on for some time without reaching their ears because they lived very retiredly but one day when mary went to sell some stockings of peggy's knitting at the neighbouring fair the man to whom she sold them bid her write her name on the back of a note and exclaimed on seeing it -- ho ho mistress i'd not have had any dealings with you had i known your name sooner where's the gold that you found at rossmore castle it was in vain that mary related the fact she saw that she gained no belief as her character was not known to this man or to any of those who were present she left the fair as soon as she could and though she struggled against it she felt very melancholy still she exerted herself every day at her little manufacture and she endeavoured to console herself by reflecting that she had two friends left who would not give up her character and who continued steadily to protect her and her sisters isabella and caroline everywhere asserted their belief in the integrity of the orphans but to prove it was in this instance out of their power mr hopkins the agent and his friends constantly repeated that the gold coins were taken away in coming from their house to his and these ladies were blamed by many people for continuing to countenance those that were with great reason suspected to be thieves the orphans were in a worse condition than ever when the winter came on and their benefactresses left the country to spend some months in dublin the old castle it was true was likely to last through the winter as the mason said but though the want of a comfortable house to live in was a little while ago the uppermost thing in mary's thoughts now it was not so one night as mary was going to bed she heard someone knocking hard at the door mary are you up let us in cried a voice which she knew to be the voice of betsy green the postmaster's daughter who lived in the village near them she let betsy in and asked what she could want at such a time of night give me sixpence and i'll tell you said betsy but waken anne and peggy here's a letter just come by post for you and i stepped over to you with it because i guessed you'd be glad to have it seeing it is your brother's handwriting peggy and anne were soon roused when they heard that there was a letter from edmund it was by one of his rush candles that mary read it and the letter was as follows -- dear mary nancy and little peg -- joy joy -- i always said the truth would come out at last and that he could not take our good name from us but i will not tell you how it all came about till we meet which will be next week as we are i mean master and mistress and the young ladies -- bless them -- and mr gilbert and i coming down to the vicarage to keep christmas and a happy christmas 'tis likely to be for honest folks as for they that are not honest it is not for them to expect to be happy at christmas or any other time you shall know all when we meet so till then fare ye well dear mary nancy and little peg your joyful and affectionate brother edmund to comprehend why edmund is joyful our readers must be informed of certain things which happened after isabella and caroline went to dublin one morning they went with their father and mother to see the magnificent library of a nobleman who took generous and polite pleasure in thus sharing the advantages of his wealth and station with all who had any pretensions to science or literature knowing that the gentleman who was now come to see his library was skilled in antiquities the nobleman opened a drawer of medals to ask his opinion concerning the age of some coins which he had lately purchased at a high price they were the very same which the orphans had found at rossmore castle isabella and caroline knew them again instantly and as the cross which isabella had made on each of them was still visible through a magnifying glass there could be no possibility of doubt the nobleman who was much interested both by the story of these orphans and the manner in which it was told to him sent immediately for the person from whom he had purchased the coins he was a jew broker at first he refused to tell them from whom he got them because he had bought them he said under a promise of secrecy being further pressed he acknowledged that it was made a condition in his bargain that he should not sell them to anyone in ireland but that he had been tempted by the high price the present noble possessor had offered at last when the jew was informed that the coins were stolen and that he would be proceeded against as a receiver of stolen goods if he did not confess the whole truth he declared that he had purchased them from a gentleman whom he had never seen before or since but he added that he could swear to his person if he saw him again now mr hopkins the agent was at this time in dublin and caroline's father posted the jew the next day in the back-parlour of a banker's house with whom mr hopkins had on this day appointed to settle some accounts mr hopkins came -- the jew knew him -- swore that he was the man who had sold the coins to him and thus the guilt of the agent and the innocence of the orphans were completely proved a full account of all that happened was sent to england to mr harvey their landlord and a few posts afterwards there came a letter from him containing a dismissal of the dishonest agent and a reward for the honest and industrious orphans mr harvey desired that mary and her sisters might have the slated house rent free from this time forward under the care of ladies isabella and caroline as long as mary or her sisters should carry on in it any useful business this was the joyful news which edmund had to tell his sisters all the neighbours shared in their joy and the day of their removal from the ruins of rossmore castle to their new house was the happiest of the christmas holidays they were not envied for their prosperity because everybody saw that it was the reward of their good conduct everybody except goody grope she exclaimed as she wrung her hands with violent expressions of sorrow -- bad luck to me bad luck to me -- why didn't i go sooner to that there castle it is all luck all luck in this world but i never had no luck think of the luck of these childer that have found a pot of gold and such great grand friends and a slated house and all and here am i with scarce a rag to cover me and not a potato to put into my mouth -- i that have been looking under ground all my days for treasure not to have a halfpenny at the last to buy me tobacco that is the very reason that you have not a halfpenny said betsy here mary has been working hard and so have her two little sisters and her brother for these five years past and they have made money for themselves by their own industry -- and friends too -- not by luck but by -- phoo phoo interrupted goody grope don't be prating don't i know as well as you do that they found a pot of gold by good luck and is not that the cause why they are going to live in a slated house now no replied the postmaster's daughter this house is given to them as a reward -- that was the word in the letter for i saw it edmund showed it to me and will show it to anyone that wants to see this house was given to them 'as a reward for their honesty ' lazy lawrence in the pleasant valley of ashton there lived an elderly woman of the name of preston she had a small neat cottage and there was not a weed to be seen in her garden it was upon her garden that she chiefly depended for support it consisted of strawberry beds and one small border for flowers the pinks and roses she tied up in nice nosegays and sent either to clifton or bristol to be sold as to her strawberries she did not send them to market because it was the custom for numbers of people to come from clifton in the summer time to eat strawberries and cream at the gardens in ashton now the widow preston was so obliging active and good-humoured that everyone who came to see her was pleased she lived happily in this manner for several years but alas one autumn she fell sick and during her illness everything went wrong her garden was neglected her cow died and all the money which she had saved was spent in paying for medicines the winter passed away while she was so weak that she could earn but little by her work and when the summer came her rent was called for and the rent was not ready in her little purse as usual she begged a few months' delay and they were granted to her but at the end of that time there was no resource but to sell her horse lightfoot now lightfoot though perhaps he had seen his best days was a very great favourite in his youth he had always carried the dame to the market behind her husband and it was now her little son jem's turn to ride him it was jem's business to feed lightfoot and to take care of him -- a charge which he never neglected for besides being a very good natured he was a very industrious boy it will go near to break my jem's heart said dame preston to herself as she sat one evening beside the fire stirring the embers and considering how she had best open the matter to her son who stood opposite to her eating a dry crust of bread very heartily for supper jem said the old woman what ar't hungry that i am brave and hungry ay no wonder you've been brave hard at work -- eh brave hard i wish it was not so dark mother that you might just step out and see the great bed i've dug i know you'd say it was no bad day's work -- and oh mother i've good news farmer truck will give us the giant strawberries and i'm to go for 'em tomorrow morning and i'll be back afore breakfast god bless the boy how he talks -- four mile there and four mile back again afore breakfast ay upon lightfoot you know mother very easily mayn't i ay child why do you sigh mother finish thy supper child i've done cried jem swallowing the last mouthful hastily as if he thought he had been too long at supper -- and now for the great needle i must see and mend lightfoot's bridle afore i go to bed to work he set by the light of the fire and the dame having once more stirred it began again with jem dear does he go lame at all now what lightfoot oh la no not he -- never was so well of his lameness in all his life he's grown quite young again i think and then he's so fat he can hardly wag god bless him -- that's right we must see jem and keep him fat for what mother for monday fortnight at the fair he's to be -- sold lightfoot cried jem and let the bridle fall from his hand and will mother sell lightfoot will no but i must jem must who says you must why must you mother i must i say child why must not i pay my debts honestly and must not i pay my rent and was not it called for long and long ago and have not i had time and did not i promise to pay it for certain monday fortnight and am not i two guineas short and where am i to get two guineas so what signifies talking child said the widow leaning her head upon her arm lightfoot must go jem was silent for a few minutes -- two guineas that's a great great deal if i worked and worked and worked ever so hard i could no ways earn two guineas afore monday fortnight -- could i mother lord help thee no not an' work thyself to death but i could earn something though i say cried jem proudly and i will earn something -- if it be ever so little it will be something -- and i shall do my very best so i will that i'm sure of my child said his mother drawing him towards her and kissing him you were always a good industrious lad that i will say afore your face or behind your back -- but it won't do now -- lightfoot must go jem turned away struggling to hide his tears and went to bed without saying a word more but he knew that crying would do no good so he presently wiped his eyes and lay awake considering what he could possibly do to save the horse if i get ever so little he still said to himself it will be something and who knows but landlord might then wait a bit longer and we might make it all up in time for a penny a day might come to two guineas in time but how to get the first penny was the question then he recollected that one day when he had been sent to clifton to sell some flowers he had seen an old woman with a board beside her covered with various sparkling stones which people stopped to look at as they passed and he remembered that some people bought the stones one paid twopence another threepence and another sixpence for them and jem heard her say that she got them amongst the neighbouring rocks so he thought that if he tried he might find some too and sell them as she had done early in the morning he wakened full of this scheme jumped up dressed himself and having given one look at poor lightfoot in his stable set off to clifton in search of the old woman to inquire where she found her sparkling stones but it was too early in the morning the old woman was not at her seat so he turned back again disappointed he did not waste his time waiting for her but saddled and bridled lightfoot and went to farmer truck's for the giant strawberries a great part of the morning was spent in putting them into the ground and as soon as that was finished he set out again in quest of the old woman whom to his great joy he spied sitting at her corner of the street with her board before her but this old woman was deaf and cross and when at last jem made her hear his questions he could get no answer from her but that she found the fossils where he would never find any more but can't i look where you looked look away nobody hinders you replied the old woman and these were the only words she would say jem was not however a boy to be easily discouraged he went to the rocks and walked slowly along looking at all the stones as he passed presently he came to a place where a number of men were at work loosening some large rocks and one amongst the workmen was stooping down looking for something very eagerly jem ran up and asked if he could help him yes said the man you can i've just dropped amongst this heap of rubbish a fine piece of crystal that i got to-day what kind of a looking thing is it said jem white and like glass said the man and went on working whilst jem looked very carefully over the heap of rubbish for a great while come said the man it's gone for ever don't trouble yourself any more my boy it's no trouble i'll look a little longer we'll not give it up so soon said jem and after he had looked a little longer he found the piece of crystal thank'e said the man you are a fine little industrious fellow jem encouraged by the tone of voice in which the man spoke this ventured to ask him the same questions which he had asked the old woman one good turn deserves another said the man we are going to dinner just now and shall leave off work -- wait for me here and i'll make it worth your while jem waited and as he was very attentively observing how the workmen went on with their work he heard somebody near him give a great yawn and turning round he saw stretched upon the grass beside the river a boy about his own age who in the village of ashton as he knew went by the name of lazy lawrence -- a name which he most justly deserved for he never did anything from morning to night he neither worked nor played but sauntered or lounged about restless and yawning his father was an ale-house keeper and being generally drunk could take no care of his son so that lazy lawrence grew every day worse and worse however some of the neighbours said that he was a good natured poor fellow enough and would never do anyone harm but himself whilst others who were wiser often shook their heads and told him that idleness was the root of all evil what lawrence cried jem to him when he saw him lying upon the grass what are you asleep not quite are you awake not quite what are you doing there nothing what are you thinking of nothing what makes you lie there i don't know -- because i can't find anybody to play with me to-day will you come and play no i can't i'm busy busy cried lawrence stretching himself you are always busy i would not be you for the world to have so much to do always and i said jem laughing would not be you for the world to have nothing to do they then parted for the workman just then called jem to follow him he took him home to his own house and showed him a parcel of fossils which he had gathered he said on purpose to sell but had never had time enough to sell them now however he set about the task and having picked out those which he judged to be the best he put them in a small basket and gave them to jem to sell upon condition that he should bring him half of what he got jem pleased to be employed was ready to agree to what the man proposed provided his mother had no objection when he went home to dinner he told his mother his scheme and she smiled and said he might do as he pleased for she was not afraid of his being from home you are not an idle boy said she so there is little danger of your getting into any mischief accordingly jem that evening took his stand with his little basket upon the bank of the river just at the place where people land from a ferry- boat and the walk turns to the wells and numbers of people perpetually pass to drink the waters he chose his place well and waited nearly all the evening offering his fossils with great assiduity to every passenger but not one person bought any hallo cried some sailors who had just rowed a boat to land bear a hand here will you my little fellow and carry these parcels for us into yonder house jem ran down immediately for the parcels and did what he was asked to do so quickly and with so much good-will that the master of the boat took notice of him and when he was going away stopped to ask him what he had got in his little basket and when he saw that they were fossils he immediately told jem to follow him for that he was going to carry some shells he had brought from abroad to a lady in the neighbourhood who was making a grotto she will very likely buy your stones into the bargain come along my lad we can but try the lady lived but a very little way off so that they were soon at her house she was alone in her parlour and was sorting a bundle of feathers of different colours they lay on a sheet of pasteboard upon a window seat and it happened that as the sailor was bustling round the table to show off his shells he knocked down the sheet of pasteboard and scattered all the feathers the lady looked very sorry which jem observing he took the opportunity whilst she was busy looking over the sailor's bag of shells to gather together all the feathers and sort them according to their different colours as he had seen them sorted when he first came into the room where is the little boy you brought with you i thought i saw him here just now and here i am ma'am cried jem creeping from under the table with some few remaining feathers which he had picked from the carpet i thought added he pointing to the others i had better be doing something than standing idle ma'am she smiled and pleased with his activity and simplicity began to ask him several questions such as who he was where he lived what employment he had and how much a day he earned by gathering fossils this is the first day i ever tried said jem i never sold any yet and if you don't buy 'em now ma'am i'm afraid nobody else will for i've asked everybody else come then said the lady laughing if that is the case i think i had better buy them all so emptying all the fossils out of his basket she put half a crown into it jem's eyes sparkled with joy oh thank you ma'am said he i will be sure and bring you as many more to-morrow yes but i don't promise you said she to give you half a crown to- morrow but perhaps though you don't promise it you will no said the lady do not deceive yourself i assure you that i will not that instead of encouraging you to be industrious would teach you to be idle jem did not quite understand what she meant by this but answered i'm sure i don't wish to be idle what i want is to earn something every day if i know how i'm sure i don't wish to be idle if you knew all you'd know i did not how do you mean if i knew all why i mean if you knew about lightfoot who's lightfoot why mammy's horse added jem looking out of the window i must make haste home and feed him afore it gets dark he'll wonder what's gone with me let him wonder a few minutes longer said the lady and tell me the rest of your story i've no story ma'am to tell but as how mammy says he must go to the fair monday fortnight to be sold if she can't get the two guineas for her rent and i should be main sorry to part with him for i love him and he loves me so i'll work for him i will all i can to be sure as mammy says i have no chance such a little fellow as i am of earning two guineas afore monday fortnight but are you willing earnestly to work said the lady you know there is a great deal of difference between picking up a few stones and working steadily every day and all day long but said jem i would work every day and all day long then said the lady i will give you work come here to-morrow morning and my gardener will set you to weed the shrubberies and i will pay you sixpence a day remember you must be at the gates by six o'clock jem bowed thanked her and went away it was late in the evening and jem was impatient to get home to feed lightfoot yet he recollected that he had promised the man who had trusted him to sell the fossils that he would bring him half of what he got for them so he thought that he had better go to him directly and away he went running along by the waterside about a quarter of a mile till he came to the man's house he was just come home from work and was surprised when jem showed him the half-crown saying look what i got for the stones you are to have half you know no said the man when he had heard his story i shall not take half of that it was given to you i expected but a shilling at the most and the half of that is but sixpence and that i'll take wife give the lad two shillings and take this half-crown so the wife opened an old glove and took out two shillings and the man as she opened the glove put in his fingers and took out a little silver penny there he shall have that into the bargain for his honesty -- honesty is the best policy -- there's a lucky penny for you that i've kept ever since i can remember don't you ever go to part with it do ye hear cried the woman let him do what he will with it wife said the man but argued the wife another penny would do just as well to buy gingerbread and that's what it will go for no that it shall not i promise you said jem and so he ran away home fed lightfoot stroked him went to bed jumped up at five o'clock in the morning and went singing to work as gay as a lark four days he worked every day and all day long and every evening the lady when she came out to walk in her gardens looked at his work at last she said to her gardener this little boy works very hard never had so good a little boy about the grounds said the gardener he's always at his work let me come by when i will and he has got twice as much done as another would do yes twice as much ma'am for look here -- he began at this 'ere rose-bush and now he's got to where you stand ma'am and here is the day's work that t'other boy and he's three years older too did to-day -- i say measure jem's fairly and it's twice as much i'm sure well said the lady to her gardener show me how much is a fair day's work for a boy of his age come at six o'clock and go at six why about this much ma'am said the gardener marking off a piece of the border with his spade then little boy said the lady so much shall be your task every day the gardener will mark it off for you and when you've done the rest of the day you may do what you please jem was extremely glad of this and the next day he had finished his task by four o'clock so that he had all the rest of the evening to himself he was as fond of play as any little boy could be and when he was at it he played with all the eagerness and gaiety imaginable so as soon as he had finished his task fed lightfoot and put by the sixpence he had earned that day he ran to the playground in the village where he found a party of boys playing and amongst them lazy lawrence who indeed was not playing but lounging upon a gate with his thumb in his mouth the rest were playing at cricket jem joined them and was the merriest and most active amongst them till at last when quite out of breath with running he was obliged to give up to rest himself and sat down upon the stile close to the gate on which lazy lawrence was swinging and why don't you play lawrence said he i'm tired said lawrence tired of what i don't know well what tires me grandmother says i'm ill and i must take something -- i don't know what ails me oh pugh take a good race -- one two three and away -- and you'll find yourself as well as ever come run -- one two three and away ah no i can't run indeed said he hanging back heavily you know i can play all day long if i like it so i don't mind play as you do who have only one hour for it so much the worse for you come now i'm quite fresh again will you have one game at ball do no i tell you i can't i'm as tired as if i had been working all day long as hard as a horse ten times more said jem for i have been working all day long as hard as a horse and yet you see i'm not a bit tired only a little out of breath just now that's very odd said lawrence and yawned for want of some better answer then taking out a handful of halfpence -- see what i got from father today because i asked him just at the right time when he had drunk a glass or two then i can get anything i want out of him -- see a penny twopence threepence fourpence -- there's eightpence in all would not you be happy if you had eightpence why i don't know said jem laughing for you don't seem happy and you have eightpence that does not signify though i'm sure you only say that because you envy me you don't know what it is to have eightpence you never had more than twopence or threepence at a time in all your life jem smiled oh as to that said he you are mistaken for i have at this very time more than twopence threepence or eightpence either i have -- let me -- see -- stones two shillings then five days' work -- that's five sixpences that's two shillings and sixpence in all makes four shillings and sixpence and my silver penny is four and sevenpence -- four and sevenpence you have not said lawrence roused so as absolutely to stand upright four and sevenpence have you show it me and then i'll believe you follow me then cried jem and i'll soon make you believe me come is it far said lawrence following half-running half-hobbling till he came to the stable where jem showed him his treasure and how did you come by it -- honestly honestly to be sure i did i earned it all lord bless me earned it well i've a great mind to work but then it's such hot weather besides grandmother says i'm not strong enough yet for hard work and besides i know how to coax daddy out of money when i want it so i need not work but four and sevenpence let's see what will you do with it all that's a secret said jem looking great i can guess i know what i'd do with it if it was mine first i'd buy pocketfuls of gingerbread then i'd buy ever so many apples and nuts don't you love nuts i'd buy nuts enough to last me from this time to christmas and i'd make little newton crack 'em for me for that's the worst of nuts there's the trouble of cracking 'em well you never deserve to have a nut but you'll give me some of yours said lawrence in a fawning tone for he thought it easier to coax than to work -- you'll give me some of your good things won't you i shall not have any of those good things said jem then what will you do with all your money oh i know very well what to do with it but as i told you that's a secret and i sha'n't tell it anybody come now let's go back and play- -their game's up i daresay lawrence went back with him full of curiosity and out of humour with himself and his eightpence if i had four and sevenpence said he to himself i certainly should be happy the next day as usual jem jumped up before six o'clock and went to his work whilst lazy lawrence sauntered about without knowing what to do with himself in the course of two days he laid out sixpence of his money in apples and gingerbread and as long as these lasted he found himself well received by his companions but at length the third day he spent his last halfpenny and when it was gone unfortunately some nuts tempted him very much but he had no money to pay for them so he ran home to coax his father as he called it when he got home he heard his father talking very loud and at first he thought he was drunk but when he opened the kitchen door he saw that he was not drunk but angry you lazy dog cried he turning suddenly upon lawrence and gave him such a violent box on the ear as made the light flash from his eyes you lazy dog see what you've done for me -- look -- look look i say lawrence looked as soon as he came to the use of his senses and with fear amazement and remorse beheld at least a dozen bottles burst and the fine worcestershire cider streaming over the floor now did not i order you three days ago to carry these bottles to the cellar and did not i charge you to wire the corks answer me you lazy rascal did not i yes said lawrence scratching his head and why was not it done i ask you cried his father with renewed anger as another bottle burst at the moment what do you stand there for you lazy brat why don't you move i say no no catching hold of him i believe you can't move but i'll make you and he shook him till lawrence was so giddy he could not stand what had you to think of what had you to do all day long that you could not carry my cider my worcestershire cider to the cellar when i bid you but go you'll never be good for anything you are such a lazy rascal -- get out of my sight so saying he pushed him out of the house door and lawrence sneaked off seeing that this was no time to make his petition for halfpence the next day he saw the nuts again and wishing for them more than ever he went home in hopes that his father as he said to himself would be in a better humour but the cider was still fresh in his recollection and the moment lawrence began to whisper the word halfpenny in his ear his father swore with a loud oath i will not give you a halfpenny no not a farthing for a month to come if you want money go work for it i've had enough of your laziness -- go work at these terrible words lawrence burst into tears and going to the side of a ditch sat down and cried for an hour and when he had cried till he could cry no more he exerted himself so far as to empty his pockets to see whether there might not happen to be one halfpenny left and to his great joy in the farthest corner of his pocket one halfpenny was found with this he proceeded to the fruit woman's stall she was busy weighing out some plums so he was obliged to wait and whilst he was waiting he heard some people near him talking and laughing very loud the fruit woman's stall was at the gate of an inn yard and peeping through the gate in this yard lawrence saw a postilion and a stable boy about his own size playing at pitch farthing he stood by watching them for a few minutes i began but with one halfpenny cried the stable boy with an oath and now i've got twopence added he jingling the halfpence in his waistcoat pocket lawrence was moved at the sound and said to himself if i begin with one halfpenny i may end like him with having twopence and it is easier to play at pitch farthing than to work so he stepped forward presenting his halfpenny offering to toss up with the stable boy who after looking him full in the face accepted the proposal and threw his halfpenny into the air head or tail cried he head replied lawrence and it came up head he seized the penny surprised at his own success and would have gone instantly to have laid it out in nuts but the stable boy stopped him and tempted him to throw again this time lawrence lost he threw again and won and so he went on sometimes losing but most frequently winning till half the morning was lost at last however finding himself the master of three halfpence said he would play no more the stable boy grumbling swore he would have his revenge another time and lawrence went and bought his nuts it is a good thing said he to himself to play at pitch farthing the next time i want a halfpenny i'll not ask my father for it nor go to work neither satisfied with this resolution he sat down to crack his nuts at his leisure upon the horse block in the inn yard here whilst he ate he overheard the conversation of the stable boys and postilions at first their shocking oaths and loud wrangling frightened and shocked him for lawrence though lazy had not yet learned to be a wicked boy but by degrees he was accustomed to the swearing and quarrelling and took a delight and interest in their disputes and battles as this was an amusement which he could enjoy without any sort of exertion he soon grew so fond of it that every day he returned to the stable yard and the horse block became his constant seat here he found some relief from the insupportable fatigue of doing nothing and here hour after hour with his elbows on his knees and his head on his hands he sat the spectator of wickedness gaming cheating and lying soon became familiar to him and to complete his ruin he formed a sudden and close intimacy with the stable boy a very bad boy with whom he had first begun to game the consequences of this intimacy we shall presently see but it is now time to inquire what little jem had been doing all this while one day after jem had finished his task the gardener asked him to stay a little while to help him to carry some geranium pots into the hall jem always active and obliging readily stayed from play and was carrying in a heavy flower pot when his mistress crossed the hall what a terrible litter said she you are making here -- why don't you wipe your shoes upon the mat jem turned to look for the mat but he saw none oh said the lady recollecting herself i can't blame you for there is no mat no ma'am said the gardener nor i don't know when if ever the man will bring home those mats you bespoke ma'am i am very sorry to hear that said the lady i wish we could find somebody who would do them if he can't i should not care what sort of mats they were so that one could wipe one's feet on them jem as he was sweeping away the litter when he heard these last words said to himself perhaps i could make a mat and all the way home as he trudged along whistling he was thinking over a scheme for making mats which however bold it may appear he did not despair of executing with patience and industry many were the difficulties which his prophetic eye foresaw but he felt within himself that spirit which spurs men on to great enterprises and makes them trample on impossibilities in the first place he recollected that he had seen lazy lawrence whilst he lounged upon the gate twist a bit of heath into different shapes and he thought that if he could find some way of plaiting heath firmly together it would make a very pretty green soft mat which would do very well for one to wipe one's shoes on about a mile from his mother's house on the common which jem rode over when he went to farmer truck's for the giant strawberries he remembered to have seen a great quantity of this heath and as it was now only six o'clock in the evening he knew that he should have time to feed lightfoot stroke him go to the common return and make one trial of his skill before he went to bed lightfoot carried him swiftly to the common and there jem gathered as much of the heath as he thought he should want but what toil what time what pains did it cost him before he could make anything like a mat twenty times he was ready to throw aside the heath and give up his project from impatience of repeated disappointments but still he persevered nothing truly great can be accomplished without toil and time two hours he worked before he went to bed all his play hours the next day he spent at his mat which in all made five hours of fruitless attempts the sixth however repaid him for the labours of the other five he conquered his grand difficulty of fastening the heath substantially together and at length completely finished a mat which far surpassed his most sanguine expectations he was extremely happy -- sang danced round it -- whistled -- looked at it again and again and could hardly leave off looking at it when it was time to go to bed he laid it by his bedside that he might see it the moment he awoke in the morning and now came the grand pleasure of carrying it to his mistress she looked fully as much surprised as he expected when she saw it and when she heard who made it after having duly admired it she asked how much he expected for his mat expect -- nothing ma'am said jem i meant to give it you if you'd have it i did not mean to sell it i made it in my play hours i was very happy in making it and i'm very glad too that you like it and if you please to keep it ma'am that's all but that's not all said the lady spend your time no more in weeding in my garden you can employ yourself much better you shall have the reward of your ingenuity as well as of your industry make as many more such mats as you can and i will take care and dispose of them for you thank'e ma'am said jem making his best bow for he thought by the lady's looks that she meant to do him a favour though he repeated to himself dispose of them what does that mean the next day he went to work to make more mats and he soon learned to make them so well and quickly that he was surprised at his own success in every one he made he found less difficulty so that instead of making two he could soon make four in a day in a fortnight he made eighteen it was saturday night when he finished and he carried at three journeys his eighteen mats to his mistress' house piled them all up in the hall and stood with his hat off with a look of proud humility beside the pile waiting for his mistress' appearance presently a folding-door at one end of the hall opened and he saw his mistress with a great many gentlemen and ladies rising from several tables oh there is my little boy and his mats cried the lady and followed by all the rest of the company she came into the hall jem modestly retired whilst they looked at his mats but in a minute or two his mistress beckoned to him and when he came into the middle of the circle he saw that his pile of mats had disappeared well said the lady smiling what do you see that makes you look so surprised that all my mats are gone said jem but you are very welcome are we said the lady well take up your hat and go home then for you see that it is getting late and you know lightfoot will wonder what's become of you jem turned round to take up his hat which he had left on the floor but how his countenance changed the hat was heavy with shillings everyone who had taken a mat had put in two shillings so that for the eighteen mats he had got thirty-six shillings thirty-six shillings said the lady five and sevenpence i think you told me you had earned already -- how much does that make i must add i believe one other sixpence to make out your two guineas two guineas exclaimed jem now quite conquering his bashfulness for at the moment he forgot where he was and saw nobody that was by two guineas cried he clapping his hands together -- o lightfoot o mother then recollecting himself he saw his mistress whom he now looked up to quite as a friend will you thank them all said he scarcely daring to glance his eyes round upon the company will you thank 'em for you know i don't know how to thank 'em rightly everybody thought however that they had been thanked rightly now we won't keep you any longer only said his mistress i have one thing to ask you that i may be by when you show your treasure to your mother come then said jem come with me now not now said the lady laughing but i will come to ashton to-morrow evening perhaps your mother can find me a few strawberries that she will said jem i'll search the garden myself he now went home but felt it a great restraint to wait till to-morrow evening before he told his mother to console himself he flew to the stable -- lightfoot you're not to be sold on monday poor fellow said he patting him and then could not refrain from counting out his money whilst he was intent upon this jem was startled by a noise at the door somebody was trying to pull up the latch it opened and there came in lazy lawrence with a boy in a red jacket who had a cock under his arm they started when they got into the middle of the stable and when they saw jem who had been at first hidden by the horse we -- we -- we came stammered lazy lawrence -- i mean i came to -- to -- to -- to ask you continued the stable-boy in a bold tone whether you will go with us to the cock-fight on monday see i've a fine cock here and lawrence told me you were a great friend of his so i came lawrence now attempted to say something in praise of the pleasures of cock-fighting and in recommendation of his new companion but jem looked at the stable-boy with dislike and a sort of dread then turning his eyes upon the cock with a look of compassion said in a low voice to lawrence shall you like to stand by and see its eyes pecked out i don't know said lawrence as to that but they say a cockfight's a fine sight and it's no more cruel in me to go than another and a great many go and i've nothing else to do so i shall go but i have something else to do said jem laughing so i shall not go but continued lawrence you know monday is the great bristol fair and one must be merry then of all the days in the year one day in the year sure there's no harm in being merry said the stable boy i hope not said jem for i know for my part i am merry every day in the year that's very odd said lawrence but i know for my part i would not for all the world miss going to the fair for at least it will be something to talk of for half a year after come you'll go won't you no said jem still looking as if he did not like to talk before the ill-looking stranger then what will you do with all your money i'll tell you about that another time whispered jem and don't you go to see that cock's eyes pecked out it won't make you merry i'm sure if i had anything else to divert me said lawrence hesitating and yawning come cried the stable boy seizing his stretching arm come along cried he and pulling him away from jem upon whom he cast a look of extreme contempt leave him alone he's not the sort what a fool you are said he to lawrence the moment he got him out of the stable you might have known he would not go else we should soon have trimmed him out of his four and sevenpence but how came you to talk of four and sevenpence i saw in the manger a hat full of silver indeed exclaimed lawrence yes indeed but why did you stammer so when we first got in you had liked to have blown us all up i was so ashamed said lawrence hanging down his head ashamed but you must not talk of shame now you are in for it and i sha'n't let you off you owe us half a crown recollect and i must be paid to-night so see and get the money somehow or other after a considerable pause he added i answer for it he'd never miss half a crown out of all that silver but to steal said lawrence drawing back with horror i never thought i should come to that -- and from poor jem too -- the money that he has worked so hard for too but it is not stealing we don't mean to steal only to borrow it and if we win which we certainly shall at the cock-fight pay it back again and he'll never know anything about the matter and what harm will it do him besides what signifies talking you can't go to the cock- fight or the fair either if you don't and i tell ye we don't mean to steal it we'll pay it by monday night lawrence made no reply and they parted without his coming to any determination here let us pause in our story we are almost afraid to go on the rest is very shocking our little readers will shudder as they read but it is better that they should know the truth and see what the idle boy came to at last in the dead of the night lawrence heard somebody tap at his window he knew well who it was for this was the signal agreed upon between him and his wicked companion he trembled at the thoughts of what he was about to do and lay quite still with his head under the bedclothes till he heard the second tap then he got up dressed himself and opened his window it was almost even with the ground his companion said to him in a hollow voice are you ready he made no answer but got out of the window and followed when he got to the stable a black cloud was just passing over the moon and it was quite dark where are you whispered lawrence groping about where are you speak to me i am here give me your hand lawrence stretched out his hand is that your hand said the wicked boy as lawrence laid hold of him how cold it feels let us go back said lawrence it is time yet it is no time to go back replied the other opening the door you've gone too far now to go back and he pushed lawrence into the stable have you found it take care of the horse have you done what are you about make haste i hear a noise said the stable boy who watched at the door i am feeling for the half-crown but i can't find it bring all together he brought jem's broken flower pot with all the money in it to the door the black cloud had now passed over the moon and the light shone full upon them what do we stand here for said the stable boy snatching the flower-pot out of lawrence's trembling hands and pulled him away from the door good god cried lawrence you won't take all you said you'd only take half a crown and pay it back on monday you said you'd only take half a crown hold your tongue replied the other walking on deaf to all remonstrances -- if ever i am to be hanged it sha'n't be for half a crown lawrence's blood ran cold in his veins and he felt as if all his hair stood on end not another word passed his accomplice carried off the money and lawrence crept with all the horrors of guilt upon him to his restless bed all night he was starting from frightful dreams or else broad awake he lay listening to every small noise unable to stir and scarcely daring to breathe -- tormented by that most dreadful of all kinds of fear that fear which is the constant companion of an evil conscience he thought the morning would never come but when it was day when he heard the birds sing and saw everything look cheerful as usual he felt still more miserable it was sunday morning and the bell rang for church all the children of the village dressed in their sunday clothes innocent and gay and little jem the best and gayest amongst them went flocking by his door to church well lawrence said jem pulling his coat as he passed and saw lawrence leaning against his father's door what makes you look so black i said lawrence starting why do you say that i look black nay then said jem you look white enough now if that will please you for you're turned as pale as death pale replied lawrence not knowing what he said and turned abruptly away for he dared not stand another look of jem's conscious that guilt was written in his face he shunned every eye he would now have given the world to have thrown off the load of guilt which lay upon his mind he longed to follow jem to fall upon his knees and confess all dreading the moment when jem should discover his loss lawrence dared not stay at home and not knowing what to do or where to go he mechanically went to his old haunt at the stable yard and lurked thereabouts all day with his accomplice who tried in vain to quiet his fears and raise his spirits by talking of the next day's cock-fight it was agreed that as soon as the dusk of the evening came on they should go together into a certain lonely field and there divide their booty in the meantime jem when he returned from church was very full of business preparing for the reception of his mistress of whose intended visit he had informed his mother and whilst she was arranging the kitchen and their little parlour he ran to search the strawberry beds why my jem how merry you are to-day said his mother when he came in with the strawberries and was jumping about the room playfully now keep those spirits of yours jem till you want 'em and don't let it come upon you all at once have it in mind that to-morrow's fair day and lightfoot must go i bid farmer truck call for him to-night he said he'd take him along with his own and he'll be here just now -- and then i know how it will be with you jem so do i cried jem swallowing his secret with great difficulty and then tumbling head over heels four times running a carriage passed the window and stopped at the door jem ran out it was his mistress she came in smiling and soon made the old woman smile too by praising the neatness of everything in the house we shall pass over however important as they were deemed at the time the praises of the strawberries and of my grandmother's china plate another knock was heard at the door run jem said his mother i hope it's our milk-woman with cream for the lady no it was farmer truck come for lightfoot the old woman's countenance fell fetch him out dear said she turning to her son but jem was gone he flew out to the stable the moment he saw the flap of farmer truck's great-coat sit ye down farmer said the old woman after they had waited about five minutes in expectation of jem's return you'd best sit down if the lady will give you leave for he'll not hurry himself back again my boy's a fool madam about that there horse trying to laugh she added i knew how lightfoot and he would be loath enough to part he won't bring him out till the last minute so do sit ye down neighbour the farmer had scarcely sat down when jem with a pale wild countenance came back what's the matter said his mistress god bless the boy said his mother looking at him quite frightened whilst he tried to speak but could not she went up to him and then leaning his head against her he cried it's gone -- it's all gone and bursting into tears he sobbed as if his little heart would break what's gone love said his mother my two guineas -- lightfoot's two guineas i went to fetch 'em to give you mammy but the broken flower-pot that i put them in and all's gone -- quite gone repeated he checking his sobs i saw them safe last night and was showing 'em to lightfoot and i was so glad to think i had earned them all myself and i thought how surprised you'd look and how glad you'd be and how you'd kiss me and all his mother listened to him with the greatest surprise whilst his mistress stood in silence looking first at the old woman and then at jem with a penetrating eye as if she suspected the truth of his story and was afraid of becoming the dupe of her own compassion this is a very strange thing said she gravely how came you to leave all your money in a broken flower-pot in the stable how came you not to give it to your mother to take care of why don't you remember said jem looking up in the midst of his tears -- why don't you remember you your own self bid me not tell her about it till you were by and did you not tell her nay ask mammy said jem a little offended and when afterwards the lady went on questioning him in a severe manner as if she did not believe him he at last made no answer oh jem jem why don't you speak to the lady said his mother i have spoke and spoke the truth said jem proudly and she did not believe me still the lady who had lived too long in the world to be without suspicion maintained a cold manner and determined to wait the event without interfering saying only that she hoped the money would be found and advised jem to have done crying i have done said jem i shall cry no more and as he had the greatest command over himself he actually did not shed another tear not even when the farmer got up to go saying he could wait no longer jem silently went to bring out lightfoot the lady now took her seat where she could see all that passed at the open parlour-window the old woman stood at the door and several idle people of the village who had gathered round the lady's carriage examining it turned about to listen in a minute or two jem appeared with a steady countenance leading lightfoot and when he came up without saying a word put the bridle into farmer truck's hand he has been a good horse said the farmer he is a good horse cried jem and threw his arm over lightfoot's neck hiding his own face as he leaned upon him at this instant a party of milk-women went by and one of them having set down her pail came behind jem and gave him a pretty smart blow upon the back he looked up and don't you know me said she i forget said jem i think i have seen your face before but i forget do you so and you'll tell me just now said she half opening her hand that you forget who gave you this and who charged you not to part with it too here she quite opened her large hand and on the palm of it appeared jem's silver penny where exclaimed jem seizing it oh where did you find it and have you -- oh tell me have you got the rest of my money i know nothing of your money -- i don't know what you would be at said the milk-woman but where -- pray tell me where -- did you find this with them that you gave it to i suppose said the milk-woman turning away suddenly to take up her milk-pail but now jem's mistress called to her through the window begging her to stop and joining in his entreaties to know how she came by the silver penny why madam said she taking up the corner of her apron i came by it in an odd way too you must know my betty is sick so i came with the milk myself though it's not what i'm used to for my betty -- you know my betty said she turning round to the old woman my betty serves you and she's a tight and stirring lassy ma'am i can assure -- yes i don't doubt it said the lady impatiently but about the silver penny why that's true as i was coming along all alone for the rest came round and i came a short cut across yon field -- no you can't see it madam where you stand -- but if you were here -- i see it -- i know it said jem out of breath with anxiety well -- well -- i rested my pail upon the stile and sets me down awhile and there comes out of the hedge -- i don't know well how for they startled me so i'd liked to have thrown down my milk -- two boys one about the size of he said she pointing to jem and one a matter taller but ill-looking like so i did not think to stir to make way for them and they were like in a desperate hurry so without waiting for the stile one of 'em pulled at the gate and when it would not open for it was tied with a pretty stout cord one of 'em whips out with his knife and cuts it -- now have you a knife about you sir continued the milk woman to the farmer he gave her his knife here now ma'am just sticking as it were here between the blade and the haft was the silver penny the lad took no notice but when he opened it out it falls still he takes no heed but cuts the cord as i said before and through the gate they went and out of sight in half a minute i picks up the penny for my heart misgave me that it was the very one husband had had a long time and had given against my voice to he pointing to jem and i charged him not to part with it and ma'am when i looked i knew it by the mark so i thought i would show it to he again pointing to jem and let him give it back to those it belongs to it belongs to me said jem i never gave it to anybody -- but -- but cried the farmer those boys have robbed him it is they who have all his money oh which way did they go cried jem i'll run after them no no said the lady calling to her servant and she desired him to take his horse and ride after them ay added farmer truck do you take the road and i'll take the field way and i'll be bound we'll have 'em presently whilst they were gone in pursuit of the thieves the lady who was now thoroughly convinced of jem's truth desired her coachman would produce what she had ordered him to bring with him that evening out of the boot of the carriage the coachman immediately produced a new saddle and bridle how jem's eyes sparkled when the saddle was thrown upon lightfoot's back put it on your horse yourself jem said the lady it is yours confused reports of lightfoot's splendid accoutrements of the pursuit of thieves and of the fine and generous lady who was standing at dame preston's window quickly spread through the village and drew everybody from their houses they crowded round jem to hear the story the children especially who were fond of him expressed the strongest indignation against the thieves every eye was on the stretch and now some who had run down the lane came back shouting here they are they've got the thieves the footman on horseback carried one boy before him and the farmer striding along dragged another the latter had on a red jacket which little jem immediately recollected and scarcely dared lift his eyes to look at the boy on horseback good god said he to himself it must be -- yet surely it can't be lawrence the footman rode on as fast as the people would let him the boy's hat was slouched and his head hung down so that nobody could see his face at this instant there was a disturbance in the crowd a man who was half drunk pushed his way forwards swearing that nobody should stop him that he had a right to see -- and he would see and so he did for forcing through all resistance he staggered up to the footman just as he was lifting down the boy he had carried before him i will -- i tell you i will see the thief cried the drunken man pushing up the boy's hat it was his own son lawrence exclaimed the wretched father the shock sobered him at once and he hid his face in his hands there was an awful silence lawrence fell on his knees and in a voice that could scarcely be heard made a full confession of all the circumstances of his guilt such a young creature so wicked the bystanders exclaimed what could put such wickedness in your head bad company said lawrence and how came you -- what brought you into bad company i don't know except it was idleness while this was saying the farmer was emptying lazy lawrence's pockets and when the money appeared all his former companions in the village looked at each other with astonishment and terror their parents grasped their little hands closer and cried thank god he is not my son how often when he was little we used as he lounged about to tell him that idleness was the root of all evil as for the hardened wretch his accomplice everyone was impatient to have him sent to gaol he put on a bold insolent countenance till he heard lawrence's confession till the money was found upon him and he heard the milk-woman declare that she would swear to the silver penny which he had dropped then he turned pale and betrayed the strongest signs of fear we must take him before the justice said the farmer and he'll be lodged in bristol gaol oh said jem springing forwards when lawrence's hands were going to be tied let him go -- won't you -- can't you let him go yes madam for mercy's sake said jem's mother to the lady think what a disgrace to his family to be sent to gaol his father stood by wringing his hands in an agony of despair it's all my fault cried he i brought him up in idleness but he'll never be idle any more said jem won't you speak for him ma'am don't ask the lady to speak for him said the farmer it's better he should go to bridewell now than to the gallows by-and-by nothing more was said for everybody felt the truth of the farmer's speech lawrence was eventually sent to bridewell for a month and the stable-boy was sent for trial convicted and transported to botany bay during lawrence's confinement jem often visited him and carried him such little presents as he could afford to give and jem could afford to be generous because he was industrious lawrence's heart was touched by his kindness and his example struck him so forcibly that when his confinement was ended he resolved to set immediately to work and to the astonishment of all who knew him soon became remarkable for industry he was found early and late at his work established a new character and for ever lost the name of lazy lawrence the false key mr spencer a very benevolent and sensible man undertook the education of several poor children among the rest was a boy of the name of franklin whom he had bred up from the time he was five years old franklin had the misfortune to be the son of a man of infamous character and for many years this was a disgrace and reproach to his child when any of the neighbours' children quarrelled with him they used to tell him that he would turn out like his father but mr spencer always assured him that he might make himself whatever he pleased that by behaving well he would certainly sooner or later secure the esteem and love of all who knew him even of those who had the strongest prejudice against him on his father's account this hope was very delightful to franklin and he showed the strongest desire to learn and to do everything that was right so that mr spencer soon grew fond of him and took great pains to instruct him and to give him all the good habits and principles which might make him a useful respectable and happy man when he was about thirteen years of age mr spencer one day sent for him into his closet and as he was folding up a letter which he had been writing said to him with a very kind look but in a graver tone than usual franklin you are going to leave me sir said franklin you are now going to leave me and to begin the world for yourself you will carry this letter to my sister mrs churchill in queen's square you know queen's square franklin bowed you must expect continued mr spencer to meet with several disagreeable things and a great deal of rough work at your first setting out but be faithful and obedient to your mistress and obliging to your fellow-servants and all will go well mrs churchill will make you a very good mistress if you behave properly and i have no doubt but you will thank you sir and you will always -- i mean as long as you deserve it -- find a friend in me thank you sir -- i am sure you are -- there franklin stopped short for the recollection of all mr spencer's goodness rushed upon him at once and he could not say another word bring me a candle to seal this letter said his master and he was very glad to get out of the room he came back with the candle and with a stout heart stood by whilst the letter was sealing and when his master put it into his hand said in a cheerful voice i hope you will let me see you again sir sometimes certainly whenever your mistress can spare you i shall be very glad to see you and remember if ever you get into any difficulty don't be afraid to come to me i have sometimes spoken harshly to you but you will not meet with a more indulgent friend franklin at this turned away with a full heart and after making two or three attempts to express his gratitude left the room without being able to speak he got to queen's square about three o'clock the door was opened by a large red-faced man in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat to whom he felt afraid to give his message lest he should not be a servant well what's your business sir said the butler i have a letter for mrs churchill sir said franklin endeavouring to pronounce his sir in a tone as respectful as the butler's was insolent the man having examined the direction seal and edges of the letter carried it upstairs and in a few minutes returned and ordered franklin to rub his shoes well and follow him he was then shown into a handsome room where he found his mistress -- an elderly lady she asked him a few questions examining him attentively as she spoke and her severe eye at first and her gracious smile afterwards made him feel that she was a person to be both loved and feared i shall give you in charge said she ringing a bell to my housekeeper and i hope she will have no reason to be displeased with you the housekeeper when she first came in appeared with a smiling countenance but the moment she cast her eyes on franklin it changed to a look of surprise and suspicion her mistress recommended him to her protection saying pomfret i hope you will keep this boy under your own eye and she received him with a cold very well ma'am which plainly showed that she was not disposed to like him in fact mrs pomfret was a woman so fond of power and so jealous of favour that she would have quarrelled with an angel who had got so near her mistress without her introduction she smothered her displeasure however till night when as she attended her mistress' toilette she could not refrain from expressing her sentiments she began cautiously ma'am is not this the boy mr spencer was talking of one day -- that has been brought up by the villaintropic society i think they call it philanthropic society yes said her mistress and my brother gives him a high character i hope he will do very well i'm sure i hope so too observed mrs pomfret but i can't say for my part i've no great notion of those low people they say all those children are taken from the very lowest drugs and refuges of the town and surely they are like enough ma'am to take after their own fathers and mothers but they are not suffered to be with their parents rejoined the lady and therefore cannot be hurt by their example this little boy to be sure was unfortunate in his father but he has had an excellent education oh edication to be sure ma'am i know i don't say but what edication is a great thing but then ma'am edication can't change the natur that's in one they say and one's that born naturally bad and low they say all the edication in the world won't do no good and for my part ma'am i know you knows best but i should be afraid to let any of those villaintropic folks get into my house for nobody can tell the natur of them aforehand i declare it frights me pomfret i thought you had better sense how would this poor boy earn his bread he would be forced to starve or steal if everybody had such prejudices pomfret who really was a good woman was softened at this idea and said god forbid he should starve or steal and god forbid i should say anything prejudiciary of the boy for there may be no harm in him well said mrs churchill changing her tone but pomfret if we don't like the boy at the end of the month we have done with him for i have only promised mr spencer to keep him a month upon trial there is no harm done dear no ma'am to be sure and cook must put up with her disappointment that's all what disappointment about her nephew ma'am the boy she and i was speaking to you for when the day you called her up about the almond pudding ma'am if you remember you said you should have no objections to try the boy and upon that cook bought him new shirts but they are to the good as i tell her but i did not promise to take her nephew o no ma'am not at all she does not think to say that else i should be very angry but the poor woman never let fall a word any more than frets that the boy should miss such a good place well but since i did say that i should have no objection to try him i shall keep my word let him come to-morrow let them both have a fair trial and at the end of the month i can decide which i like best and which we had better keep dismissed with these orders mrs pomfret hastened to report all that had passed to the cook like a favourite minister proud to display the extent of her secret influence in the morning felix the cook's nephew arrived and the moment he came into the kitchen every eye even the scullion's was fixed upon him with approbation and afterwards glanced upon franklin with contempt -- contempt which franklin could not endure without some confusion though quite unconscious of having deserved it nor upon the most impartial and cool self-examination could he comprehend the justice of his judges he perceived indeed -- for the comparisons were minutely made in audible and scornful whispers -- that felix was a much handsomer or as the kitchen maid expressed it a much more genteeler gentlemanly looking like sort of person than he was and he was made to understand that he wanted a frill to his shirt a cravat a pair of thin shoes and above all shoe strings besides other nameless advantages which justly made his rival the admiration of the kitchen however upon calling to mind all that his friend mr spencer had ever said to him he could not recollect his having warned him that shoe strings were indispensable requisites to the character of a good servant so that he could only comfort himself with resolving if possible to make amends for these deficiencies and to dissipate the prejudices which he saw were formed against him by the strictest adherence to all that his tutor had taught him to be his duty he hoped to secure the approbation of his mistress by scrupulous obedience to all her commands and faithful care of all that belonged to her at the same time he flattered himself he should win the goodwill of his fellow servants by showing a constant desire to oblige them he pursued this plan of conduct steadily for nearly three weeks and found that he succeeded beyond his expectations in pleasing his mistress but unfortunately he found it more difficult to please his fellow servants and he sometimes offended when he least expected it he had made great progress in the affections of corkscrew the butler by working indeed very hard for him and doing every day at least half his business but one unfortunate night the butler was gone out the bell rang he went upstairs and his mistress asking where corkscrew was he answered that he was gone out where to said his mistress i don't know answered franklin and as he had told exactly the truth and meant to do no harm he was surprised at the butler's return when he repeated to him what had passed at receiving a sudden box on the ear and the appellation of a mischievous impertinent mean-spirited brat mischievous impertinent mean repeated franklin to himself but looking in the butler's face which was a deeper scarlet than usual he judged that he was far from sober and did not doubt but that the next morning when he came to the use of his reason he would be sensible of his injustice and apologize for his box of the ear but no apology coming all day franklin at last ventured to request an explanation or rather to ask what he had best do on the next occasion why said corkscrew when mistress asked for me how came you to say i was gone out because you know i saw you go out and when she asked you where i was gone how came you to say that you did not know because indeed i did not you are a stupid blockhead could you not say i was gone to the washerwoman's but were you said franklin was i cried corkscrew and looked as if he would have struck him again how dare you give me the lie mr hypocrite you would be ready enough i'll be bound to make excuses for yourself why are not mistress' clogs cleaned go along and blacken 'em this minute and send felix to me from this time forward felix alone was privileged to enter the butler's pantry felix became the favourite of corkscrew and though franklin by no means sought to pry into the mysteries of their private conferences nor ever entered without knocking at the door yet it was his fate once to be sent of a message at an unlucky time and as the door was half open he could not avoid seeing felix drinking a bumper of red liquor which he could not help suspecting to be wine and as the decanter which usually went upstairs after dinner was at this time in the butler's grasp without any stopper in it he was involuntarily forced to suspect they were drinking his mistress' wine nor were the bumpers of port the only unlawful rewards which felix received his aunt the cook had occasion for his assistance and she had many delicious douceurs in her gift many a handful of currants many a half-custard many a triangular remnant of pie besides the choice of his own meal at breakfast dinner and supper fell to the share of the favourite felix whilst franklin was neglected though he took the utmost pains to please the cook in all honourable service and when she was hot angry or hurried he was always at hand to help her and in the hour of adversity when the clock struck five and no dinner was dished and no kitchen maid with twenty pair of hands was to be had franklin would answer to her call with flowers to garnish her dishes and presence of mind to know in the midst of the commotion where everything that was wanting was to be found so that quick as lightning all difficulties vanished before him yet when the danger was over and the hour of adversity had past the ungrateful cook would forget her benefactor and when it came to his supper time would throw him with a carelessness that touched him sensibly anything which the other servants were too nice to eat all this franklin bore with fortitude nor did he envy felix the dainties which he ate sometimes close beside him for said he to himself i have a clear conscience and that is more than felix can have i know how he wins cook's favour too well and i fancy i know how i have offended her for since the day i saw the basket she has done nothing but huff me the history of the basket was this mrs pomfret the housekeeper had several times directly and indirectly given the world below to understand that she and her mistress thought there was a prodigious quantity of meat eaten of late now when she spoke it was usually at dinner time she always looked or franklin imagined that she looked suspiciously at him other people looked more maliciously but as he felt himself perfectly innocent he went on eating his dinner in silence but at length it was time to explain one sunday there appeared a handsome sirloin of beef which before noon on monday had shrunk almost to the bare bone and presented such a deplorable spectacle to the opening eyes of mrs pomfret that her long smothered indignation burst forth and she boldly declared she was now certain there had been foul play and she would have the beef found or she would know why she spoke but no beef appeared till franklin with a look of sudden recollection cried did not i see something like a piece of beef in a basket in the dairy -- i think -- the cook as if somebody had smote her a deadly blow grew pale but suddenly recovering the use of her speech turned upon franklin and with a voice of thunder gave him the lie direct and forthwith taking mrs pomfret by the ruffle led the way to the dairy declaring she could defy the world -- that so she could and would there ma'am said she kicking an empty basket which lay on the floor -- there's malice for you ask him why he don't show you the beef in the basket i thought i saw -- poor franklin began you thought you saw cried the cook coming close up to him with kimboed arms and looking like a dragon and pray sir what business has such a one as you to think you see and pray ma'am will you be pleased to speak -- perhaps ma'am he'll condescend to obey you -- ma'am will you be pleased to forbid him my dairy for here he comes prying and spying about and how ma'am am i to answer for my butter and cream or anything at all i'm sure it's what i can't pretend to unless you do me the justice to forbid him my places mrs pomfret whose eyes were blinded by her prejudices against the folks of the villaintropic society and also by her secret jealousy of a boy whom she deemed to be a growing favourite of her mistress' took part with the cook and ended as she began with a firm persuasion that franklin was the guilty person let him alone let him alone said she he has as many turns and windings as a hare but we shall catch him yet i'll be bound in some of his doublings i knew the nature of him well enough from the first time i ever set my eyes upon him but mistress shall have her own way and see the end of it these words and the bitter sense of injustice drew tears at length fast down the proud cheek of franklin which might possibly have touched mrs pomfret if felix with a sneer had not called them crocodile tears felix too thought he this is too much in fact felix had till now professed himself his firm ally and had on his part received from franklin unequivocal proofs of friendship for it must be told that every other morning when it was felix's turn to get breakfast felix never was up in decent time and must inevitably have come to public disgrace if franklin had not got all the breakfast things ready for him the bread and butter spread and the toast toasted and had not moreover regularly when the clock struck eight and mrs pomfret's foot was heard overhead run to call the sleeping felix and helped him constantly through the hurry of getting dressed one instant before the housekeeper came downstairs all this could not but be present to his memory but seeming to reproach him franklin wiped away his crocodile tears and preserved a magnanimous silence the hour of retribution was however not so far off as felix imagined cunning people may go on cleverly in their devices for some time but although they may escape once twice perhaps ninety-nine times what does that signify -- for the hundredth time they come to shame and lose all their character grown bold by frequent success felix became more careless in his operations and it happened that one day he met his mistress full in the passage as he was going on one of the cook's secret errands where are you going felix said his mistress to the washerwoman's ma'am answered he with his usual effrontery very well said she call at the bookseller's in -- stay i must write down the direction pomfret said she opening the housekeeper's room door have you a bit of paper pomfret came with the writing-paper and looked very angry to see that felix was going out without her knowledge so while mrs churchill was writing the direction she stood talking to him about it whilst he in the greatest terror imaginable looked up in her face as she spoke but was all the time intent on parrying on the other side the attacks of a little french dog of his mistress' which unluckily for him had followed her into the passage manchon was extremely fond of felix who by way of pleasing his mistress had paid most assiduous court to her dog yet now his caresses were rather troublesome manchon leaped up and was not to be rebuffed poor fellow -- poor fellow -- down down poor fellow cried felix and put him away but manchon leaped up again and began smelling near the fatal pocket in a most alarming manner you will see by this direction where you are to go said his mistress manchon come here -- and you will be so good as to bring me -- down down manchon be quiet but manchon knew better -- he had now got his head into felix's pocket and would not be quiet till he had drawn from thence rustling out of its brown paper half a cold turkey which had been missing since morning my cold turkey as i'm alive exclaimed the housekeeper darting upon it with horror and amazement what is all this said mrs churchill in a composed voice i don't know ma'am answered felix so confused that he knew not what to say but -- but what cried mrs pomfret indignation flashing from her eyes but what repeated his mistress waiting for his reply with a calm air of attention which still more disconcerted felix for though with an angry person he might have some chance of escape he knew that he could not invent any excuse in such circumstances which could stand the examination of a person in her sober senses he was struck dumb speak said mrs churchill in a still lower tone i am ready to hear all you have to say in my house everybody shall have justice speak -- but what but stammered felix and after in vain attempting to equivocate confessed that he was going to take the turkey to his cousin's but he threw all the blame upon his aunt the cook who he said had ordered him upon this expedition the cook was now summoned but she totally denied all knowledge of the affair with the same violence with which she had lately confounded franklin about the beef in the basket not entirely however with the same success for felix perceiving by his mistress' eye that she was on the point of desiring him to leave the house immediately and not being very willing to leave a place in which he had lived so well with the butler did not hesitate to confront his aunt with assurance equal to her own he knew how to bring his charge home to her he produced a note in her own handwriting the purport of which was to request her cousin's acceptance of some delicate cold turkey and to beg she would send her by the return of the bearer a little of her cherry-brandy mrs churchill coolly wrote upon the back of the note her cook's discharge and informed felix she had no further occasion for his services but upon his pleading with many tears which franklin did not call crocodile tears that he was so young that he was under the dominion of his aunt he touched mrs pomfret's compassion and she obtained for him permission to stay till the end of the month to give him yet a chance of redeeming his character mrs pomfret now seeing how far she had been imposed upon resolved for the future to be more upon her guard with felix and felt that she had treated franklin with great injustice when she accused him of malpractices about the sirloin of beef good people when they are made sensible that they have treated anyone with injustice are impatient to have an opportunity to rectify their mistake and mrs pomfret was now prepared to see everything which franklin did in the most favourable point of view especially as the next day she discovered that it was he who every morning boiled the water for her tea and buttered her toast -- services for which she had always thought she was indebted to felix besides she had rated felix's abilities very highly because he made up her weekly accounts for her but unluckily once when franklin was out of the way and she brought a bill in a hurry to her favourite to cast up she discovered that he did not know how to cast up pounds shillings and pence and he was obliged to confess that she must wait till franklin came home but passing over a number of small incidents which gradually unfolded the character of the two boys we must proceed to a more serious affair corkscrew frequently after he had finished taking away supper and after the housekeeper was gone to bed sallied forth to a neighbouring alehouse to drink with his friends the alehouse was kept by that cousin of felix's who was so fond of delicate cold turkey and who had such choice cherry-brandy corkscrew kept the key of the house door so that he could return home whenever he thought proper and if he should by accident be called for by his mistress after supper felix knew where to find him and did not scruple to make any of those excuses which poor franklin had too much integrity to use all these precautions taken the butler was at liberty to indulge his favourite passion which so increased with indulgence that his wages were by no means sufficient to support him in this way of life every day he felt less resolution to break through his bad habits for every day drinking became more necessary to him his health was ruined with a red pimpled bloated face emaciated legs and a swelled diseased body he appeared the victim of intoxication in the morning when he got up his hands trembled his spirits flagged he could do nothing until he had taken a dram -- an operation which he was obliged to repeat several times in the course of the day as all those wretched people must who once acquire this habit he had run up a long bill at the alehouse which he frequented and the landlord who grew urgent for his money refused to give further credit one night when corkscrew had drunk enough only to make him fretful he leaned with his elbow surlily upon the table began to quarrel with the landlord and swore that he had not of late treated him like a gentleman to which the landlord coolly replied that as long as he had paid like a gentleman he had been treated like one and that was as much as anyone could expect or at any rate as much as anyone would meet with in this world for the truth of this assertion he appealed laughing to a party of men who were drinking in the room the men however took part with corkscrew and drawing him over to their table made him sit down with them they were in high good-humour and the butler soon grew so intimate with them that in the openness of his heart he soon communicated to them not only all his own affairs but all that he knew and more than all that he knew of his mistress' his new friends were by no means uninterested by his conversation and encouraged him as much as possible to talk for they had secret views which the butler was by no means sufficiently sober to discover mrs churchill had some fine old family plate and these men belonged to a gang of housebreakers before they parted with corkscrew they engaged him to meet them again the next night their intimacy was still more closely cemented one of the men actually offered to lend corkscrew three guineas towards the payment of his debt and hinted that if he thought proper he could easily get the whole cleared off upon this hint corkscrew became all attention till after some hesitation on their part and repeated promises of secrecy on his they at length disclosed their plans to him they gave him to understand that if he would assist in letting them into his mistress' house they would let him have an ample share in the booty the butler who had the reputation of being an honest man and indeed whose integrity had hitherto been proof against everything but his mistress' port turned pale and trembled at this proposal drank two or three bumpers to drown thought and promised to give an answer the next day he went home more than half-intoxicated his mind was so full of what had passed that he could not help bragging to felix whom he found awake at his return that he could have his bill paid off at the alehouse whenever he pleased dropping besides some hints which were not lost upon felix in the morning felix reminded him of the things which he had said and corkscrew alarmed endeavoured to evade his questions by saying that he was not in his senses when he talked in that manner nothing however that he could urge made any impression upon felix whose recollection on the subject was perfectly distinct and who had too much cunning himself and too little confidence in his companion to be the dupe of his dissimulation the butler knew not what to do when he saw that felix was absolutely determined either to betray their scheme or to become a sharer in the booty the next night came and he was now to make a final decision either to determine on breaking off entirely with his new acquaintances or taking felix with him to join in the plot his debt his love of drinking the impossibility of indulging it without a fresh supply of money all came into his mind at once and conquered his remaining scruples it is said by those whose fatal experience gives them a right to be believed that a drunkard will sacrifice anything everything sooner than the pleasure of habitual intoxication how much easier is it never to begin a bad custom than to break through it when once formed the hour of rendezvous came and corkscrew went to the alehouse where he found the housebreakers waiting for him and a glass of brandy ready poured out he sighed -- drank -- hesitated -- drank again -- heard the landlord talk of his bill saw the money produced which would pay it in a moment -- drank again -- cursed himself and giving his hand to the villain who was whispering in his ear swore that he could not help it and must do as they would have him they required of him to give up the key of the house door that they might get another made by it he had left it with felix and was now obliged to explain the new difficulty which had arisen felix knew enough to ruin them and must therefore be won over this was no very difficult task he had a strong desire to have some worked cravats and the butler knew enough of him to believe that this would be a sufficient bribe the cravats were bought and shown to felix he thought them the only things wanting to make him a complete fine gentleman and to go without them especially when he had once seen himself in the glass with one tied on in a splendid bow appeared impossible even this paltry temptation working upon his vanity at length prevailed with a boy whose integrity had long been corrupted by the habits of petty pilfering and daily falsehood it was agreed that the first time his mistress sent him out on a message he should carry the key of the house door to his cousin's and deliver it into the hands of one of the gang who were there in waiting for it such was the scheme felix the night after all this had been planned went to bed and fell fast asleep but the butler who had not yet stifled the voice of conscience felt in the silence of the night so insupportably miserable that instead of going to rest he stole softly into the pantry for a bottle of his mistress' wine and there drinking glass after glass he stayed till he became so far intoxicated that though he contrived to find his way back to bed he could by no means undress himself without any power of recollection he flung himself upon the bed leaving his candle half hanging out of the candlestick beside him franklin slept in the next room to him and presently awaking thought he perceived a strong smell of something burning he jumped up and seeing a light under the butler's door gently opened it and to his astonishment beheld one of the bed curtains in flames he immediately ran to the butler and pulled him with all his force to rouse him from his lethargy he came to his senses at length but was so terrified and so helpless that if it had not been for franklin the whole house would soon inevitably have been on fire felix trembling and cowardly knew not what to do and it was curious to see him obeying franklin whose turn it now was to command franklin ran upstairs to awaken mrs pomfret whose terror of fire was so great that she came from her room almost out of her senses whilst he with the greatest presence of mind recollected where he had seen two large tubs of water which the maids had prepared the night before for their washing and seizing the wet linen which had been left to soak he threw them upon the flames he exerted himself with so much good sense that the fire was presently extinguished everything was now once more safe and quiet mrs pomfret recovering from her fright postponed all inquiries till the morning and rejoiced that her mistress had not been awakened whilst corkscrew flattered himself that he should be able to conceal the true cause of the accident don't you tell mrs pomfret where you found the candle when you came into the room said he to franklin if she asks me you know i must tell the truth replied he must repeated felix sneeringly what you must be a tell-tale no i never told any tales of anybody and i should be very sorry to get anyone into a scrape but for all that i shall not tell a lie either for myself or anybody else let you call me what names you will but if i were to give you something that you would like said corkscrew -- something that i know you would like repeated felix nothing you can give me will do answered franklin steadily so it is useless to say any more about it -- i hope i shall not be questioned in this hope he was mistaken for the first thing mrs pomfret did in the morning was to come into the room to examine and deplore the burnt curtains whilst corkscrew stood by endeavouring to exculpate himself by all the excuses he could invent mrs pomfret however though sometimes blinded by her prejudices was no fool and it was absolutely impossible to make her believe that a candle which had been left on the hearth where corkscrew protested he had left it could have set curtains on fire which were at least six feet distant turning short round to franklin she desired that he would show her where he found the candle when he came into the room he took up the candlestick but the moment the housekeeper cast her eye upon it she snatched it from his hands how did this candlestick come here this was not the candlestick you found here last night cried she yes indeed it was answered franklin that is impossible retorted she vehemently for i left this candlestick with my own hands last night in the hall the last thing i did after you said she turning to the butler was gone to bed -- i'm sure of it -- nay don't you recollect my taking this japanned candlestick out of your hand and making you to go up to bed with the brass one and i bolted the door at the stair-head after you this was all very true but corkscrew had afterwards gone down from his room by a back staircase unbolted that door and upon his return from the alehouse had taken the japanned candlestick by mistake upstairs and had left the brass one in its stead upon the hall table oh ma'am said felix indeed you forget for mr corkscrew came into my room to desire me to call him betimes in the morning and i happened to take particular notice and he had the japanned candlestick in his hand and that was just as i heard you bolting the door indeed ma'am you forget indeed sir retorted mrs pomfret rising in anger i do not forget i'm not come to be supperannuated yet i hope how do you dare to tell me i forget oh ma'am cried felix i beg your pardon i did not -- i did not mean to say you forgot but only i thought perhaps you might not particularly remember for if you please to recollect -- i won't please to recollect just whatever you please sir hold your tongue why should you poke yourself into this scrape what have you to do with it i should be glad to know nothing in the world oh nothing in the world i'm sure i beg your pardon ma'am answered felix in a soft tone and sneaking off left his friend corkscrew to fight his own battle secretly resolving to desert in good time if he saw any danger of the alehouse transactions coming to light corkscrew could make but very blundering excuses for himself and conscious of guilt he turned pale and appeared so much more terrified than butlers usually appear when detected in a lie that mrs pomfret resolved as she said to sift the matter to the bottom impatiently did she wait till the clock struck nine and her mistress' bell rang the signal for her attendance at her levee how do you find yourself this morning ma'am said she undrawing the curtains very sleepy indeed answered her mistress in a drowsy voice i think i must sleep half an hour longer -- shut the curtains as you please ma'am but i suppose i had better open a little of the window shutter for it's past nine but just struck oh dear ma'am it struck before i came upstairs and you know we are twenty minutes slow -- lord bless us exclaimed mrs pomfret as she let fall the bar of the window which roused her mistress i'm sure i beg your pardon a thousand times -- it's only the bar -- because i had this great key in my hand put down the key then or you'll knock something else down and you may open the shutters now for i'm quite awake dear me i'm so sorry to think of disturbing you cried mrs pomfret at the same time throwing the shutters wide open but to be sure ma'am i have something to tell you which won't let you sleep again in a hurry i brought up this here key of the house door for reasons of my own which i'm sure you'll approve of but i'm not come to that part of my story yet i hope you were not disturbed by the noise in the house last night ma'am i heard no noise i am surprised at that though continued mrs pomfret and proceeded to give a most ample account of the fire of her fears and her suspicions to be sure ma'am what i say is that without the spirit of prophecy one can nowadays account for what has passed i'm quite clear in my own judgment that mr corkscrew must have been out last night after i went to bed for besides the japanned candlestick which of itself i'm sure is strong enough to hang a man there's another circumstance ma'am that certifies it to me -- though i have not mentioned it ma'am to no one yet lowering her voice -- franklin when i questioned him told me that he left the lantern in the outside porch in the court last night and this morning it was on the kitchen table now ma'am that lantern could not come without hands and i could not forget about that you know for franklin says he's sure he left the lantern out and do you believe him inquired her mistress to be sure ma'am -- how can i help believing him i never found him out in the least symptom of a lie since ever he came into the house so one can't help believing in him like him or not without meaning to tell a falsehood however said the lady he might make a mistake no ma'am he never makes mistakes it is not his way to go gossiping and tattling he never tells anything till he's asked and then it's fit he should about the sirloin of beef and all he was right in the end i found to do him justice and i'm sure he's right now about the lantern -- he's alway's right mrs churchill could not help smiling if you had seen him ma'am last night in the midst of the fire -- i'm sure we may thank him that we were not burned alive in our beds -- and i shall never forget his coming to call me poor fellow he that i was always scolding and scolding enough to make him hate me but he's too good to hate anybody and i'll be bound i'll make it up to him now take care that you don't go from one extreme into another pomfret don't spoil the boy no ma'am there's no danger of that but i'm sure if you had seen him last night yourself you would think he deserved to be rewarded and so he shall be rewarded said mrs churchill but i will try him more fully yet there's no occasion i think for trying him any more ma'am said mrs pomfret who was as violent in her likings as in her dislikes pray desire continued her mistress that he will bring up breakfast this morning and leave the key of the house-door pomfret with me when franklin brought the urn into the breakfast-parlour his mistress was standing by the fire with the key in her hand she spoke to him of his last night's exertions in terms of much approbation how long have you lived with me said she pausing three weeks i think three weeks and four days madam that is but a short time yet you have conducted yourself so as to make me think i may depend upon you you know this key i believe madam it is the key of the house-door it is i shall trust it in your care it is a great trust for so young a person as you are franklin stood silent with a firm but modest look if you take the charge of this key continued his mistress remember it is upon condition that you never give it out of your own hands in the daytime it must not be left in the door you must not tell anybody where you keep it at night and the house-door must not be unlocked after eleven o'clock at night unless by my orders will you take charge of the key upon these conditions i will madam do anything you order me said franklin and received the key from her hands when mrs churchill's orders were made known they caused many secret marvellings and murmurings corkscrew and felix were disconcerted and dared not openly avow their discontent and they treated franklin with the greatest seeming kindness and cordiality everything went on smoothly for three days the butler never attempted his usual midnight visits to the alehouse but went to bed in proper time and paid particular court to mrs pomfret in order to dispel her suspicions she had never had any idea of the real fact that he and felix were joined in a plot with house-breakers to rob the house but thought he only went out at irregular hours to indulge himself in his passion for drinking thus stood affairs the night before mrs churchill's birthday corkscrew by the housekeeper's means ventured to present a petition that he might go to the play the next day and his request was granted franklin came into the kitchen just when all the servants had gathered round the butler who with great importance was reading aloud the play- bill everybody present soon began to speak at once and with great enthusiasm talked of the playhouse the actors and actresses and then felix in the first pause turned to franklin and said lord you know nothing of all this you never went to a play did you never said franklin and felt he did not know why a little ashamed and he longed extremely to go to one how should you like to go to the play with me to-morrow said corkscrew oh exclaimed franklin i should like it exceedingly and do you think mistress would let you if i asked i think maybe she would if mrs pomfret asked her but then you have no money have you no said franklin sighing but stay said corkscrew what i am thinking of is that if mistress will let you go i'll treat you myself rather than that you should he disappointed delight surprise and gratitude appeared in franklin's face at these words corkscrew rejoiced to see that now at least he had found a most powerful temptation well then i'll go just now and ask her in the meantime lend me the key of the house door for a minute or two the key answered franklin starting i'm sorry but i can't do that for i've promised my mistress never to let it out of my own hands but how will she know anything of the matter run run and get it for us no i cannot replied franklin resisting the push which the butler gave his shoulder you can't cried corkscrew changing his tone then sir i can't take you to the play very well sir said franklin sorrowfully but with steadiness very well sir said felix mimicking him you need not look so important nor fancy yourself such a great man because you're master of a key say no more to him interrupted corkscrew let him alone to take his own way felix you would have no objection i suppose to going to the play with me oh i should like it of all things if i did not come between anybody else but come come added the hypocrite assuming a tone of friendly persuasion you won't be such a blockhead franklin as to lose going to the play for nothing it's only just obstinacy what harm can it do to lend mr corkscrew the key for five minutes he'll give it to you back again safe and sound i don't doubt that answered franklin then it must be all because you don't wish to oblige mr corkscrew no but i can't oblige him in this for as i told you before my mistress trusted me i promised never to let the key out of my own hands and you would not have me break my trust mr spencer told me that was worse than robbing at the word robbing both corkscrew and felix involuntarily cast down their eyes and turned the conversation immediately saying that he did very right that they did not really want the key and had only asked for it just to try if he would keep his word shake hands said corkscrew i am glad to find you out to be an honest fellow i am sorry you did not think me an honest fellow before mr corkscrew said franklin giving his hand rather proudly and he walked away we shall make no hand of this prig said corkscrew but we'll have the key from him in spite of all his obstinacy said felix and let him make his story good as he can afterwards he shall repent of these airs to-night i'll watch him and find out where he hides the key and when he's asleep we'll get it without thanking him this plan felix put into execution they discovered the place where franklin kept the key at night stole it whilst he slept took off the impression in wax and carefully replaced it in franklin's trunk exactly where they found it probably our young readers cannot guess what use they could mean to make of this impression of the key in wax knowing how to do mischief is very different from wishing to do it and the most innocent persons are generally the least ignorant by means of the impression which they had thus obtained corkscrew and felix proposed to get a false key made by picklock a smith who belonged to their gang of house-breakers and with this false key knew they could open the door whenever they pleased little suspecting what had happened franklin the next morning went to unlock the house door as usual but finding the key entangled in the lock he took it out to examine it and perceived a lump of wax sticking in one of the wards struck with this circumstance it brought to his mind all that had passed the preceding evening and being sure that he had no wax near the key he began to suspect what had happened and he could not help recollecting what he had once heard felix say that give him but a halfpenny worth of wax and he could open the strongest lock that ever was made by hands all these things considered franklin resolved to take the key just as it was with the wax sticking to it to his mistress i was not mistaken when i thought i might trust you with this key said mrs churchill after she had heard his story my brother will be here to-day and i shall consult him in the meantime say nothing of what has passed evening came and after tea mr spencer sent for franklin upstairs so mr franklin said he i'm glad to find you are in such high trust in this family franklin bowed but you have lost i understand the pleasure of going to the play to-night i don't think anything -- much i mean of that sir answered franklin smiling are corkscrew and felix gone to the play yes half an hour ago sir then i shall look into his room and examine the pantry and the plate that is under his care when mr spencer came to examine the pantry he found the large salvers and cups in a basket behind the door and the other things placed so as to be easily carried off nothing at first appeared in corkscrew's bedchamber to strengthen their suspicions till just as they were going to leave the room mrs pomfret exclaimed why if there is not mr corkscrew's dress coat hanging up there and if here isn't felix's fine cravat that he wanted in such a hurry to go to the play why sir they can't be gone to the play look at the cravat ah upon my word i am afraid they are not at the play no sir you may be sure that they are plotting with their barbarous gang at the alehouse and they'll certainly break into the house to-night we shall all be murdered in our beds as sure as i'm a living woman sir but if you'll only take my advice -- pray good mrs pomfret mr spencer observed don't be alarmed nay sir but i won't pretend to sleep in the house if franklin isn't to have a blunderbuss and i a baggonet you shall have both indeed mrs pomfret but don't make such a noise for everybody will hear you the love of mystery was the only thing which could have conquered mrs pomfret's love of talking she was silent and contented herself the rest of the evening with making signs looking ominous and stalking about the house like one possessed with a secret escaped from mrs pomfret's fears and advice mr spencer went to a shop within a few doors of the alehouse which he heard corkscrew frequented and sent to beg to speak to the landlord he came and when mr spencer questioned him confessed that corkscrew and felix were actually drinking in his house with two men of suspicious appearance that as he passed through the passage he heard them disputing about a key and that one of them said since we've got the key we'll go about it to-night this was sufficient information mr spencer lest the landlord should give them information of what was going forwards took him along with him to bow street a constable and proper assistance was sent to mrs churchill's they stationed themselves in a back parlour which opened on a passage leading to the butler's pantry where the plate was kept a little after midnight they heard the hall door open corkscrew and his accomplices went directly to the pantry and there mr spencer and the constable immediately secured them as they were carrying off their booty mrs churchill and pomfret had spent the night at the house of an acquaintance in the same street well ma'am said mrs pomfret who had heard all the news in the morning the villains are all safe thank god i was afraid to go to the window this morning but it was my luck to see them all go by to gaol they looked so shocking i am sure i never shall forget felix's look to my dying day but poor franklin ma'am that boy has the best heart in the world i could not get him to give a second look at them as they passed poor fellow i thought he would have dropped and he was so modest ma'am when mr spencer spoke to him and told him he had done his duty and did my brother tell him what reward i intend for him no ma'am and i'm sure franklin thinks no more of reward than i do i intend continued mrs churchill to sell some of my old useless plate and to lay it out in an annuity for franklin's life la ma'am exclaimed mrs pomfret with unfeigned joy i'm sure you are very good and i'm very glad of it and continued mrs churchill here are some tickets for the play which i shall beg you pomfret to give him and to take him with you i am very much obliged to you indeed ma'am and i'll go with him with all my heart and choose such plays as won't do no prejudice to his morality and ma'am continued mrs pomfret the night after the fire i left him my great bible and my watch in my will for i never was more mistaken at the first in any boy in my born days but he has won me by his own deserts and i shall from this time forth love all the villaintropic folks for his sake simple susan chapter i waked as her custom was before the day to do the observance due to sprightly may dryden in a retired hamlet on the borders of wales between oswestry and shrewsbury it is still the custom to celebrate the 1st of may the children of the village who look forward to this rural festival with joyful eagerness usually meet on the last day of april to make up their nosegays for the morning and to choose their queen their customary place of meeting is at a hawthorn which stands in a little green nook open on one side to a shady lane and separated on the other side by a thick sweet-brier and hawthorn hedge from the garden of an attorney this attorney began the world with nothing but he contrived to scrape together a good deal of money everybody knew how he built a new house at the entrance of the village and had a large well fenced garden yet notwithstanding his fences he never felt himself secure such were his litigious habits and his suspicious temper that he was constantly at variance with his simple and peaceable neighbours some pig or dog or goat or goose was for ever trespassing his complaints and his extortions wearied and alarmed the whole hamlet the paths in his fields were at length unfrequented his stiles were blocked up with stones or stuffed with brambles and briers so that not a gosling could creep under or a giant get over them indeed so careful were even the village children of giving offence to this irritable man of the law that they would not venture to fly a kite near his fields lest it should entangle in his trees or fall upon his meadow mr case for this was the name of our attorney had a son and a daughter to whose education he had not time to attend as his whole soul was intent upon accumulating for them a fortune for several years he suffered his children to run wild in the village but suddenly on his being appointed to a considerable agency he began to think of making his children a little genteel he sent his son to learn latin he hired a maid to wait upon his daughter barbara and he strictly forbade her thenceforward to keep company with any of the poor children who had hitherto been her playfellows they were not sorry for this prohibition because she had been their tyrant rather than their companion she was vexed to observe that her absence was not regretted and she was mortified to perceive that she could not humble them by any display of airs and finery there was one poor girl amongst her former associates to whom she had a peculiar dislike -- susan price a sweet tempered modest sprightly industrious lass who was the pride and delight of the village her father rented a small farm and unfortunately for him he lived near attorney case barbara used often to sit at her window watching susan at work sometimes she saw her in the neat garden raking the beds or weeding the borders sometimes she was kneeling at her beehive with fresh flowers for her bees sometimes she was in the poultry yard scattering corn from her sieve amongst the eager chickens and in the evening she was often seated in a little honeysuckle arbour with a clean light three-legged deal table before her upon which she put her plain work susan had been taught to work neatly by her good mother who was very fond of her and to whom she was most gratefully attached mrs price was an intelligent active domestic woman but her health was not robust she earned money however by taking in plain work and she was famous for baking excellent bread and breakfast cakes she was respected in the village for her conduct as a wife and as a mother and all were eager to show her attention at her door the first branch of hawthorn was always placed on may morning and her susan was usually queen of the may it was now time to choose the queen the setting sun shone full upon the pink blossoms of the hawthorn when the merry group assembled upon their little green barbara was now walking in sullen state in her father's garden she heard the busy voices in the lane and she concealed herself behind the high hedge that she might listen to their conversation where's susan were the first unwelcome words which she overheard ay where's susan repeated philip stopping short in the middle of a new tune that he was playing on his pipe i wish susan would come i want her to sing me this same tune over again i have not it yet and i wish susan would come i'm sure cried a little girl whose lap was full of primroses susan will give me some thread to tie up my nosegays and she'll show me where the fresh violets grow and she has promised to give me a great bunch of her double cowslips to wear to- morrow i wish she would come nothing can be done without susan she always shows us where the nicest flowers are to be found in the lanes and meadows said they she must make up the garlands and she shall be queen of the may exclaimed a multitude of little voices but she does not come said philip rose who was her particular friend now came forward to assure the impatient assembly that she would answer for it susan would come as soon as she possibly could and that she probably was detained by business at home the little electors thought that all business should give way to theirs and rose was dispatched to summon her friend immediately tell her to make haste cried philip attorney case dined at the abbey to-day -- luckily for us if he comes home and finds us here maybe he'll drive us away for he says this bit of ground belongs to his garden though that is not true i'm sure for farmer price knows and says it was always open to the road the attorney wants to get our playground so he does i wish he and his daughter bab or miss barbara as she must now be called were a hundred miles off out of our way i know no later than yesterday she threw down my nine-pins in one of her ill-humours as she was walking by with her gown all trailing in the dust yes cried mary the little primrose-girl her gown is always trailing she does not hold it up nicely like susan and with all her fine clothes she never looks half so neat mamma says she wishes i may be like susan when i grow up to be a great girl and so do i i should not like to look conceited as barbara does if i was ever so rich rich or poor said philip it does not become a girl to look conceited much less bold as barbara did the other day when she was at her father's door without a hat upon her head staring at the strange gentleman who stopped hereabout to let his horse drink i know what he thought of bab by his looks and of susan too for susan was in her garden bending down a branch of the laburnum-tree looking at its yellow flowers which were just come out and when the gentleman asked her how many miles it was from shrewsbury she answered him so modest -- not bashful like as if she had never seen nobody before -- but just right and then she pulled on her straw hat which was fallen back with her looking up at the laburnum and she went her ways home and the gentleman says to me after she was gone 'pray who is that neat modest girl -- ' but i wish susan would come cried philip interrupting himself susan was all this time as her friend rose rightly guessed busy at home she was detained by her father's returning later than usual his supper was ready for him nearly an hour before he came home and susan swept up the ashes twice and twice put on wood to make a cheerful blaze for him but at last when he did come in he took no notice of the blaze or of susan and when his wife asked him how he did he made no answer but stood with his back to the fire looking very gloomy susan put his supper upon the table and set his own chair for him but he pushed away the chair and turned from the table saying -- i shall eat nothing child why have you such a fire to roast me at this time of the year you said yesterday father i thought that you liked a little cheerful wood fire in the evening and there was a great shower of hail your coat is quite wet we must dry it take it then child said he pulling it off -- i shall soon have no coat to dry -- and take my hat too said he throwing it upon the ground susan hung up his hat put his coat over the back of a chair to dry and then stood anxiously looking at her mother who was not well she had this day fatigued herself with baking and now alarmed by her husband's moody behaviour she sat down pale and trembling he threw himself into a chair folded his arms and fixed his eyes upon the fire susan was the first who ventured to break silence happy the father who has such a daughter as susan -- her unaltered sweetness of temper and her playful affectionate caresses at last somewhat dissipated her father's melancholy he could not be prevailed upon to eat any of the supper which had been prepared for him however with a faint smile he told susan that he thought he could eat one of her guinea-hen's eggs she thanked him and with that nimble alacrity which marks the desire to please she ran to her neat chicken-yard but alas her guinea-hen was not there -- it had strayed into the attorney's garden she saw it through the paling and timidly opening the little gate she asked miss barbara who was walking slowly by to let her come in and take her guinea-hen barbara who was at this instant reflecting with no agreeable feelings upon the conversation of the village children to which she had recently listened started when she heard susan's voice and with a proud ill-humoured look and voice refused her request shut the gate said barbara you have no business in our garden and as for your hen i shall keep it it is always flying in here and plaguing us and my father says it is a trespasser and he told me i might catch it and keep it the next time it got in and it is in now then barbara called to her maid betty and bid her catch the mischievous hen oh my guinea-hen my pretty guinea-hen cried susan as they hunted the frightened screaming creature from corner to corner here we have got it said betty holding it fast by the legs now pay damages queen susan or good-bye to your pretty guinea-hen said barbara in an insulting tone damages what damages said susan tell me what i must pay a shilling said barbara oh if sixpence would do said susan i have but sixpence of my own in the world and here it is it won't do said barbara turning her back nay but hear me cried susan let me at least come in to look for its eggs i only want one for my father's supper you shall have all the rest what's your father or his supper to us is he so nice that he can eat none but guinea-hen's eggs said barbara if you want your hen and your eggs pay for them and you'll have them i have but sixpence and you say that won't do said susan with a sigh as she looked at her favourite which was in the maid's grasping hands struggling and screaming in vain susan retired disconsolate at the door of her father's cottage she saw her friend rose who was just come to summon her to the hawthorn bush they are all at the hawthorn and i am come for you we can do nothing without you dear susan cried rose running to meet her at the moment she saw her you are chosen queen of the may -- come make haste but what is the matter why do you look so sad ah said susan don't wait for me i can't come to you but added she pointing to the tuft of double cowslips in the garden gather those for poor little mary i promised them to her and tell her the violets are under a hedge just opposite the turnstile on the right as we go to church good-bye never mind me i can't come -- i can't stay for my father wants me but don't turn away your face i won't keep you a moment only tell me what's the matter said her friend following her into the cottage oh nothing not much said susan only that i wanted the egg in a great hurry for father it would not have vexed me -- to be sure i should have clipped my guinea-hen's wings and then she could not have flown over the hedge but let us think no more about it now added she twinkling away a tear when rose however learnt that her friend's guinea-hen was detained prisoner by the attorney's daughter she exclaimed with all the honest warmth of indignation and instantly ran back to tell the story to her companions barbara ay like father like daughter cried farmer price starting from the thoughtful attitude in which he had been fixed and drawing his chair closer to his wife you see something is amiss with me wife -- i'll tell you what it is as he lowered his voice susan who was not sure that he wished she should hear what he was going to say retired from behind his chair susan don't go sit you down here my sweet susan said he making room for her upon his chair i believe i was a little cross when i came in first tonight but i had something to vex me as you shall hear about a fortnight ago you know wife continued he there was a balloting in our town for the militia now at that time i wanted but ten days of forty years of age and the attorney told me i was a fool for not calling myself plump forty but the truth is the truth and it is what i think fittest to be spoken at all times come what will of it so i was drawn for a militiaman but when i thought how loth you and i would be to part i was main glad to hear that i could get off by paying eight or nine guineas for a substitute -- only i had not the nine guineas -- for you know we had bad luck with our sheep this year and they died away one after another -- but that was no excuse so i went to attorney case and with a power of difficulty i got him to lend me the money for which to be sure i gave him something and left my lease of our farm with him as he insisted upon it by way of security for the loan attorney case is too many for me he has found what he calls a flaw in my lease and the lease he tells me is not worth a farthing and that he can turn us all out of our farm to-morrow if he pleases and sure enough he will please for i have thwarted him this day and he swears he'll be revenged of me indeed he has begun with me badly enough already i'm not come to the worst part of my story yet -- here farmer price made a dead stop and his wife and susan looked up in his face breathless with anxiety it must come out said he with a short sigh i must leave you in three days wife must you said his wife in a faint resigned voice susan love open the window susan ran to open the window and then returned to support her mother's head when she came a little to herself she sat up begged that her husband would go on and that nothing might be concealed from her her husband had no wish indeed to conceal anything from a wife he loved so well but firm as he was and steady to his maxim that the truth was the thing the fittest to be spoken at all times his voice faltered and it was with great difficulty that he brought himself to speak the whole truth at this moment the fact was this case met farmer price as he was coming home whistling from a new ploughed field the attorney had just dined at the abbey the abbey was the family seat of an opulent baronet in the neighbourhood to whom mr case had been agent the baronet died suddenly and his estate and title devolved to a younger brother who was now just arrived in the country and to whom mr case was eager to pay his court in hopes of obtaining his favour of the agency he flattered himself that he was pretty secure and he thought that he might assume the tone of command towards the tenants especially towards one who was some guineas in debt and in whose lease there was a flaw accosting the farmer in a haughty manner the attorney began with so farmer price a word with you if you please walk on here man beside my horse and you'll hear me you have changed your opinion i hope about that bit of land -- that corner at the end of my garden as how mr case said the farmer as how man why you said something about its not belonging to me when you heard me talk of inclosing it the other day so i did said price and so i do provoked and astonished at the firm tone in which these words were pronounced the attorney was upon the point of swearing that he would have his revenge but as his passions were habitually attentive to the letter of the law he refrained from any hasty expression which might he was aware in a court of justice be hereafter brought against him my good friend mr price said he in a soft voice and pale with suppressed rage he forced a smile i'm under the necessity of calling in the money i lent you some time ago and you will please to take notice that it must be paid to-morrow morning i wish you a good evening you have the money ready for me i daresay no said the farmer not a guinea of it but john simpson who was my substitute has not left our village yet i'll get the money back from him and go myself if so be it must be so into the militia -- so i will the attorney did not expect such a determination and he represented in a friendly hypocritical tone to price that he had no wish to drive him to such an extremity that it would be the height of folly in him to run his head against a wall for no purpose you don't mean to take the corner into your own garden do you price said he i said the farmer god forbid it's none of mine i never take what does not belong to me true right very proper of course said mr case but then you have no interest in life in the land in question none then why so stiff about it price all i want of you to say -- to say that black is white which i won't do mr case the ground is a thing not worth talking of but it's neither yours nor mine in my memory since the new lane was made it has always been open to the parish and no man shall inclose it with my good-will truth is truth and must be spoken justice is justice and should be done mr attorney and law is law mr farmer and shall have its course to your cost cried the attorney exasperated by the dauntless spirit of this village hampden here they parted the glow of enthusiasm the pride of virtue which made our hero brave could not render him insensible as he drew nearer home many melancholy thoughts pressed upon his heart he passed the door of his own cottage with resolute steps however and went through the village in search of the man who had engaged to be his substitute he found him told him how the matter stood and luckily the man who had not yet spent the money was willing to return it as there were many others drawn for the militia who he observed would be glad to give him the same price or more for his services the moment price got the money he hastened to mr case's house walked straight forward into his room and laying the money down upon his desk there mr attorney are your nine guineas count them now i have done with you not yet said the attorney jingling the money triumphantly in his hand we'll give you a taste of the law my good sir or i'm mistaken you forgot the flaw in your lease which i have safe in this desk ah my lease said the farmer who had almost forgot to ask for it till he was thus put in mind of it by the attorney's imprudent threat give me my lease mr case i've paid my money you have no right to keep the lease any longer whether it is a bad one or a good one pardon me said the attorney locking his desk and putting the key into his pocket possession my honest friend cried he striking his hand upon the desk is nine points of the law good night to you i cannot in conscience return a lease to a tenant in which i know there is a capital flaw it is my duty to show it to my employer or in other words to your new landlord whose agent i have good reasons to expect i shall be you will live to repent your obstinacy mr price your servant sir price retired with melancholy feelings but not intimidated many a man returns home with a gloomy countenance who has not quite so much cause for vexation when susan heard her father's story she quite forgot her guinea-hen and her whole soul was intent upon her poor mother who notwithstanding her utmost exertion could not support herself under this sudden stroke of misfortune in the middle of the night susan was called up her mother's fever ran high for some hours but towards morning it abated and she fell into a soft sleep with susan's hand locked fast in hers susan sat motionless and breathed softly lest she should disturb her the rushlight which stood beside the bed was now burnt low the long shadow of the tall wicker chair flitted faded appeared and vanished as the flame rose and sunk in the socket susan was afraid that the disagreeable smell might waken her mother and gently disengaging her hand she went on tiptoe to extinguish the candle all was silent the grey light of the morning was now spreading over every object the sun rose slowly and susan stood at the lattice window looking through the small leaded cross-barred panes at the splendid spectacle a few birds began to chirp but as susan was listening to them her mother started in her sleep and spoke unintelligibly susan hung up a white apron before the window to keep out the light and just then she heard the sound of music at a distance in the village as it approached nearer she knew that it was philip playing upon his pipe and tabor she distinguished the merry voices of her companions carolling in honour of the may and soon she saw them coming towards her father's cottage with branches and garlands in their hands she opened quick but gently the latch of the door and ran out to meet them here she is -- here's susan they exclaimed joyfully here's the queen of the may and here's her crown cried rose pressing forward but susan put her finger upon her lips and pointed to her mother's window philip's pipe stopped instantly thank you said susan my mother is ill i can't leave her you know then gently putting aside the crown her companions bid her say who should wear it for her will you dear rose said she placing the garland upon her friend's head it's a charming may morning added she with a smile good-bye we sha'n't hear your voices or the pipe when you have turned the corner into the village so you need only stop till then philip i shall stop for all day said philip i've no mind to play any more good-bye poor susan it is a pity you can't come with us said all the children and little mary ran after susan to the cottage door i forgot to thank you said she for the double cowslips look how pretty they are and smell how sweet the violets are in my bosom and kiss me quick for i shall be left behind susan kissed the little breathless girl and returned softly to the side of her mother's bed how grateful that child is to me for a cowslip only how can i be grateful enough to such a mother as this said susan to herself as she bent over her sleeping mother's pale countenance her mother's unfinished knitting lay upon a table near the bed and susan sat down in her wicker arm-chair and went on with the row in the middle of which her hand stopped the preceding evening she taught me to knit she taught me everything that i know thought susan and the best of all she taught me to love her to wish to be like her her mother when she awakened felt much refreshed by her tranquil sleep and observing that it was a delightful morning said that she had been dreaming she heard music but that the drum frightened her because she thought it was the signal for her husband to be carried away by a whole regiment of soldiers who had pointed their bayonets at him but that was but a dream susan i awoke and knew it was a dream and i then fell asleep and have slept soundly ever since how painful it is to awake to the remembrance of misfortune gradually as this poor woman collected her scattered thoughts she recalled the circumstances of the preceding evening she was too certain that she had heard from her husband's own lips the words i must leave you in three days and she wished that she could sleep again and think it all a dream but he'll want he'll want a hundred things said she starting up i must get his linen ready for him i'm afraid it's very late susan why did you let me lie so long everything shall be ready dear mother only don't hurry yourself said susan and indeed her mother was ill able to bear any hurry or to do any work this day susan's affectionate dexterous sensible activity was never more wanted or more effectual she understood so readily she obeyed so exactly and when she was left to her own discretion judged so prudently that her mother had little trouble and no anxiety in directing her she said that susan never did too little or too much susan was mending her father's linen when rose tapped softly at the window and beckoned to her to come out she went out how does your mother do in the first place said rose better thank you that's well and i have a little bit of good news for you besides -- here said she pulling out a glove in which there was money we'll get the guinea-hen back again -- we have all agreed about it this is the money that has been given to us in the village this may morning at every door they gave silver see how generous they have been -- twelve shillings i assure you now we are a match for miss barbara you won't like to leave home i'll go to barbara and you shall see your guinea-hen in ten minutes rose hurried away pleased with her commission and to accomplish her business miss barbara's maid betty was the first person that was visible at the attorney's house rose insisted upon seeing miss barbara herself and she was shown into a parlour to the young lady who was reading a dirty novel which she put under a heap of law papers as they entered dear how you startled me is it only you said she to her maid but as soon as she saw rose behind the maid she put on a scornful air could not ye say i was not at home betty well my good girl what brings you here something to borrow or beg i suppose may every ambassador -- every ambassador in as good a cause -- answer with as much dignity and moderation as rose replied to barbara upon the present occasion she assured her that the person from whom she came did not send her either to beg or borrow that she was able to pay the full value of that for which she came to ask and producing her well filled purse i believe that this is a very good shilling said she if you don't like it i will change it and now you will be so good as to give me susan's guinea-hen it is in her name i ask for it no matter in whose name you ask for it replied barbara you will not have it take up your shilling if you please i would have taken a shilling yesterday if it had been paid at the time properly but i told susan that if it was not paid then i should keep the hen and so i shall i promise her you may go back and tell her so the attorney's daughter had whilst rose opened her negotiation measured the depth of her purse with a keen eye and her penetration discovered that it contained at least ten shillings with proper management she had some hopes that the guinea-hen might be made to bring in at least half the money rose who was of a warm temper not quite so fit a match as she had thought herself for the wily barbara incautiously exclaimed whatever it costs us we are determined to have susan's favourite hen so if one shilling won't do take two and if two won't do why take three the shillings sounded provoking upon the table as she threw them down one after another and barbara coolly replied three won't do have you no conscience miss barbara then take four barbara shook her head a fifth shilling was instantly proffered but bab who now saw plainly that she had the game in her own hands preserved a cold cruel silence rose went on rapidly bidding shilling after shilling till she had completely emptied her purse the twelve shillings were spread upon the table barbara's avarice was moved she consented for this ransom to liberate her prisoner rose pushed the money towards her but just then recollecting that she was acting for others more than for herself and doubting whether she had full powers to conclude such an extravagant bargain she gathered up the public treasure and with newly-recovered prudence observed that she must go back to consult her friends her generous little friends were amazed at barbara's meanness but with one accord declared that they were most willing for their parts to give up every farthing of the money they all went to susan in a body and told her so there's our purse said they do what you please with it they would not wait for one word of thanks but ran away leaving only rose with her to settle the treaty for the guinea-hen there is a certain manner of accepting a favour which shows true generosity of mind many know how to give but few know how to accept a gift properly susan was touched but not astonished by the kindness of her young friends and she received the purse with as much simplicity as she would have given it well said rose shall i go back for the guinea-hen the guinea-hen said susan starting from a reverie into which she had fallen as she contemplated the purse certainly i do long to see my pretty guinea-hen once more but i was not thinking of her just then -- i was thinking of my father now susan had heard her mother often in the course of this day wish that she had but money enough in the world to pay john simpson for going to serve in the militia instead of her husband this to be sure will go but a little way thought susan but still it may be of some use to my father she told her mind to rose and concluded by saying decidedly that if the money was given to her to dispose of as she pleased she would give it to her father it is all yours my dear good susan cried rose with a look of warm approbation this is so like you -- but i'm sorry that miss bab must keep your guinea-hen i would not be her for all the guinea-hens or guineas either in the whole world why i'll answer for it the guinea-hen won't make her happy and you'll be happy even without because you are good let me come and help you to-morrow continued she looking at susan's work if you have any more mending work to do -- i never liked work till i worked with you i won't forget my thimble or my scissors added she laughing -- though i used to forget them when i was a giddy girl i assure you i am a great hand at my needle now -- try me susan assured her friend that she did not doubt the powers of her needle and that she would most willingly accept of her services but that unluckily she had finished all the needle work immediately wanted but do you know said she i shall have a great deal of business to- morrow but i won't tell you what it is that i have to do for i am afraid i shall not succeed but if i do succeed i'll come and tell you directly because you will be so glad of it susan who had always been attentive to what her mother taught her and who had often assisted her when she was baking bread and cakes for the family at the abbey had now formed the courageous but not presumptuous idea that she could herself undertake to bake a batch of bread one of the servants from the abbey had been sent all round the village in the morning in search of bread and had not been able to procure any that was tolerable mrs price's last baking failed for want of good barm she was not now strong enough to attempt another herself and when the brewer's boy came with eagerness to tell her that he had some fine fresh yeast she thanked him but sighed and said it would be of no use to her accordingly she went to work with much prudent care and when her bread the next morning came out of the oven it was excellent at least her mother said so and she was a good judge it was sent to the abbey and as the family there had not tasted any good bread since their arrival in the country they also were earnest and warm in its praise inquiries were made from the housekeeper and they heard with some surprise that this excellent bread was made by a young girl only twelve years old the housekeeper who had known susan from a child was pleased to have an opportunity in speaking in her favour she is the most industrious little creature ma'am in the world said she to her mistress little i can't so well call her now since she's grown tall and slender to look at and glad i am she is grown up likely to look at for handsome is that handsome does she thinks no more of her being handsome than i do myself yet she has as proper a respect for herself ma'am as you have and i always see her neat and with her mother ma'am or fit people as a girl should be as for her mother she dotes upon her as well she may for i should myself if i had half such a daughter and then she has two little brothers and she's as good to them and my boy philip says taught 'em to read more than the school-mistress all with tenderness and good nature but i beg your pardon ma'am i cannot stop myself when i once begin to talk of susan you have really said enough to excite my curiosity said her mistress pray send for her immediately we can see her before we go out to walk the benevolent housekeeper despatched her boy philip for susan who never happened to be in such an untidy state as to be unable to obey a summons without a long preparation she had it is true been very busy but orderly people can be busy and neat at the same time she put on her usual straw hat and accompanied rose's mother who was going with a basket of cleared muslin to the abbey the modest simplicity of susan's appearance and the artless propriety of the answers she gave to all the questions that were asked her pleased the ladies at the abbey who were good judges of character and manners sir arthur somers had two sisters sensible benevolent women they were not of that race of fine ladies who are miserable the moment they come to the country nor yet were they of that bustling sort who quack and direct all their poor neighbours for the mere love of managing or the want of something to do they were judiciously generous and whilst they wished to diffuse happiness they were not peremptory in requiring that people should be happy precisely their own way with these dispositions and with a well informed brother who though he never wished to direct was always willing to assist in their efforts to do good there were reasonable hopes that these ladies would be a blessing to the poor villagers amongst whom they were now settled as soon as miss somers had spoken to susan she inquired for her brother but sir arthur was in his study and a gentleman was with him on business susan was desirous of returning to her mother and the ladies therefore would not detain her miss somers told her with a smile when she took leave that she would call upon her in the evening at six o'clock it was impossible that such a grand event as susan's visit to the abbey could long remain unknown to barbara case and her gossiping maid they watched eagerly for the moment of her return that they might satisfy their curiosity there she is i declare just come into her garden cried bab i'll run in and get it all out of her in a minute bab could descend without shame whenever it suited her purposes from the height of insolent pride to the lowest meanness of fawning familiarity susan was gathering some marigolds and some parsley for her mother's broth so susan said bab who came close up to her before she perceived it how goes the world with you to-day my mother is rather better to-day she says ma'am -- thank you replies susan coldly but civilly ma'am dear how polite we are grown of a sudden cried bab winking at her maid one may see you've been in good company this morning -- hey susan come let's hear about it did you see the ladies themselves or was it only the housekeeper sent for you said the maid what room did you go into continued bab did you see miss somers or sir arthur miss somers la she saw miss somers betty i must hear about it can't you stop gathering those things for a minute and chat a bit with us susan i can't stay indeed miss barbara for my mother's broth is just wanted and i'm in a hurry susan ran home lord her head is full of broth now said bab to her maid and she has not a word for herself though she has been abroad my papa may well call her simple susan for simple she is and simple she will be all the world over for my part i think she's little better than a downright simpleton but however simple or not i'll get what i want out of her she'll be able to speak maybe when she has settled the grand matter of the broth i'll step in and ask to see her mother that will put her in a good humour in a trice barbara followed susan into the cottage and found her occupied with the grand affair of the broth is it ready said bab peeping into the pot that was over the fire dear how savoury it smells i'll wait till you go in with it to your mother for i must ask her how she does myself will you please to sit down then miss said simple susan with a smile for at this instant she forgot the guinea-hen i have but just put the parsley into the broth but it soon will be ready during this interval bab employed herself much to her own satisfaction in cross-questioning susan she was rather provoked indeed that she could not learn exactly how each of the ladies was dressed and what there was to be for dinner at the abbey and she was curious beyond measure to find out what miss somers meant by saying that she would call at mr price's cottage at six o'clock in the evening what do you think she could mean i thought she meant what she said replied susan that she would come here at six o'clock ay that's as plain as a pike-staff said barbara but what else did she mean think you people you know don't always mean exactly downright neither more nor less than what they say not always said susan with an arch smile which convinced barbara that she was not quite a simpleton not always repeated barbara colouring -- oh then i suppose you have some guess at what miss somers meant no said susan i was not thinking about miss somers when i said not always how nice that broth does look resumed barbara after a pause susan had now poured the broth into a basin and as she strewed over it the bright orange marigolds it looked very tempting she tasted it and added now a little salt and now a little more till she thought it was just to her mother's taste oh i must taste it said bab taking the basin up greedily won't you take a spoon said susan trembling at the large mouthfuls which barbara sucked up with a terrible noise take a spoonful indeed exclaimed barbara setting down the basin in high anger the next time i taste your broth you shall affront me if you dare the next time i set my foot in this house you shall be as saucy to me as you please and she flounced out of the house repeating take a spoon pig was what you meant to say susan stood in amazement at the beginning of this speech but the concluding words explained to her the mystery some years before this time when susan was a very little girl and could scarcely speak plain as she was eating a basin of bread and milk for her supper at the cottage door a great pig came up and put his nose into the basin susan was willing that the pig should have some share of the bread and milk but as she ate with a spoon and he with his large mouth she presently discovered that he was likely to have more than his share and in a simple tone of expostulation she said to him take a poon pig the saying become proverbial in the village susan's little companions repeated it and applied it upon many occasions whenever anyone claimed more than his share of anything good barbara who was then not miss barbara but plain bab and who had played with all the poor children in the neighbourhood was often reproved in her unjust methods of division by susan's proverb susan as she grew up forgot the childish saying but the remembrance of it rankled in barbara's mind and it was to this that she suspected susan had alluded when she recommended a spoon to her whilst she was swallowing the basin of broth this is a true anecdote la miss said barbara's maid when she found her mistress in a passion upon her return from susan's i only wondered you did her the honour to set your foot within her doors what need have you to trouble her for news about the abbey folks when your own papa has been there all the morning and is just come in and can tell you everything barbara did not know that her father meant to go to the abbey that morning for attorney case was mysterious even to his own family about his morning rides he never chose to be asked where he was going or where he had been and this made his servants more than commonly inquisitive to trace him barbara against whose apparent childishness and real cunning he was not sufficiently on his guard had often the art of drawing him into conversation about his visits she ran into her father's parlour but she knew the moment she saw his face that it was no time to ask questions his pen was across his mouth and his brown wig pushed oblique upon his contracted forehead the wig was always pushed crooked whenever he was in a brown or rather a black study barbara who did not like susan bear with her father's testy humour from affection and gentleness of disposition but who always humoured him from artifice tried all her skill to fathom his thoughts and when she found that it would not do she went to tell her maid so and to complain that her father was so cross there was no bearing him it is true that attorney case was not in the happiest mood possible for he was by no means satisfied with his morning's work at the abbey sir arthur somers the new man did not suit him and he began to be rather apprehensive that he should not suit sir arthur he had sound reasons for his doubts sir arthur somers was an excellent lawyer and a perfectly honest man this seemed to our attorney a contradiction in terms in the course of his practice the case had not occurred and he had no precedents ready to direct his proceedings sir arthur was also a man of wit and eloquence yet of plain dealing and humanity the attorney could not persuade himself to believe that his benevolence was anything but enlightened cunning and his plain dealing he one minute dreaded as the masterpiece of art and the next despised as the characteristic of folly in short he had not yet decided whether he was an honest man or a knave he had settled accounts with him for his late agency and had talked about sundry matters of business he constantly perceived however that he could not impose upon sir arthur but the idea that he could know all the mazes of the law and yet prefer the straight road was incomprehensible mr case having paid sir arthur some compliments on his great legal abilities and his high reputation at the bar he coolly replied i have left the bar the attorney looked in unfeigned astonishment that a man who was actually making 3 ooo pounds per annum at the bar should leave it i am come said sir arthur to enjoy that kind of domestic life in the country which i prefer to all others and amongst people whose happiness i hope to increase at this speech the attorney changed his ground flattering himself that he should find his man averse to business and ignorant of country affairs he talked of the value of land and of new leases sir arthur wished to enlarge his domain and to make a ride round it a map of it was lying upon the table and farmer price's garden came exactly across the new road for the ride sir arthur looked disappointed and the keen attorney seized the moment to inform him that price's whole land was at his disposal at my disposal how so cried sir arthur eagerly it will not be out of lease i believe these ten years i'll look into the rent roll again perhaps i am mistaken you are mistaken my good sir and you are not mistaken said mr case with a shrewd smile in one sense the land will not be out of lease these ten years and in another it is out of lease at this present time to come to the point at once the lease is ab origine null and void i have detected a capital flaw in the body of it i pledge my credit upon it sir it can't stand a single term in law or equity the attorney observed that at these words sir arthur's eye was fixed with a look of earnest attention now i have him said the cunning tempter to himself neither in law nor equity repeated sir arthur with apparent incredulity are you sure of that mr case sure as i told you before sir i'd pledge my whole credit upon the thing -- i'd stake my existence that's something said sir arthur as if he was pondering upon the matter the attorney went on with all the eagerness of a keen man who sees a chance at one stroke of winning a rich friend and of ruining a poor enemy he explained with legal volubility and technical amplification the nature of the mistake in mr price's lease it was sir said he a lease for the life of peter price susanna his wife and to the survivor or survivors of them or for the full time and term of twenty years to be computed from the first day of may then next ensuing now sir this you see is a lease in reversion which the late sir benjamin somers had not by his settlement a right to make this is a curious mistake you see sir arthur and in filling up those printed leases there's always a good chance of some flaw i find it perpetually but i never found a better than this in the whole course of my practice sir arthur stood in silence my dear sir said the attorney taking him by the button you have no scruple of stirring in this business a little said sir arthur why then that can be done away in a moment your name shall not appear in it at all you have nothing to do but to make over the lease to me i make all safe to you with my bond now being in possession i come forward in my own proper person shall i proceed no -- you have said enough replied sir arthur the case indeed lies in a nutshell said the attorney who had by this time worked himself up to such a pitch of professional enthusiasm that intent upon his vision of a lawsuit he totally forgot to observe the impression his words made upon sir arthur there's only one thing we have forgotten all this time said sir arthur what can that be sir that we shall ruin this poor man case was thunderstruck at these words or rather by the look which accompanied them he recollected that he had laid himself open before he was sure of sir arthur's real character he softened and said he should have had certainly more consideration in the case of any but a litigious pig-headed fellow as he knew price to be if he be litigious said sir arthur i shall certainly be glad to get him fairly out of the parish as soon as possible when you go home you will be so good sir as to send me his lease that i may satisfy myself before we stir in this business the attorney brightening up prepared to take leave but he could not persuade himself to take his departure without making one push at sir arthur about the agency i will not trouble you sir arthur with this lease of price's said case i'll leave it with your agent whom shall i apply to to myself sir if you please replied sir arthur the courtiers of louis the fourteenth could not have looked more astounded than our attorney when they received from their monarch a similar answer it was this unexpected reply of sir arthur's which had deranged the temper of mr case and caused his wig to stand so crooked upon his forehead and which had rendered him impenetrably silent to his inquisitive daughter barbara after having walked up and down his room conversing with himself for some time the attorney concluded that the agency must be given to somebody when sir arthur should have to attend his duty in parliament that the agency even for the winter season was not a thing to be neglected and that if he managed well he might yet secure it for himself he had often found that small timely presents worked wonderfully upon his own mind and he judged of others by himself the tenants had been in the reluctant but constant practice of making him continual petty offerings and he resolved to try the same course with sir arthur whose resolution to be his own agent he thought argued a close saving avaricious disposition he had heard the housekeeper at the abbey inquiring as he passed through the servants whether there was any lamb to be gotten she said that sir arthur was remarkably fond of lamb and that she wished she could get a quarter for him immediately he sallied into his kitchen as soon as the idea struck him and asked a shepherd who was waiting there whether he knew of a nice fat lamb to be had anywhere in the neighbourhood i know of one cried barbara susan price has a pet lamb that's as fat as fat could be the attorney easily caught at these words and speedily devised a scheme for obtaining susan's lamb for nothing it would be something strange if an attorney of his talents and standing was not an over-match for simple susan he prowled forth in search of his prey he found susan packing up her father's little wardrobe and when she looked up as she knelt he saw that she had been in tears how is your mother to-day susan inquired the attorney worse sir my father goes to-morrow that's a pity it can't be helped said susan with a sigh it can't be helped -- how do you know that said case sir dear sir cried she looking up at him and a sudden ray of hope beamed in her ingenuous countenance and if you could help it susan said he susan clasped her hands in silence more expressive than words you can help it susan she started up in an ecstasy what would you give now to have your father at home for a whole week longer anything -- but i have nothing yes but you have a lamb said the hard-hearted attorney my poor little lamb said susan but what can that do what good can any lamb do is not lamb good to eat why do you look so pale girl are not sheep killed every day and don't you eat mutton is your lamb better than anybody else's think you i don't know said susan but i love it better more fool you said he it feeds out of hand it follows me about i have always taken care of it my mother gave it to me well say no more about it then he cynically observed if you love your lamb better than both your father and your mother keep it and good morning to you stay oh stay cried susan catching the skirt of his coat with an eager trembling hand -- a whole week did you say my mother may get better in that time no i do not love my lamb half so well the struggle of her mind ceased and with a placid countenance and calm voice take the lamb said she where is it said the attorney grazing in the meadow by the river side it must be brought up before night-fall for the butcher remember i shall not forget it said susan steadily as soon however as her persecutor turned his back and quitted the house susan sat down and hid her face in her hands she was soon aroused by the sound of her mother's feeble voice who was calling susan from the inner room where she lay susan went in but did not undraw the curtain as she stood beside the bed are you there love undraw the curtain that i may see you and tell me -- i thought i heard some strange voice just now talking to my child something's amiss susan said her mother raising herself as well as she was able in the bed to examine her daughter's countenance would you think it amiss then my dear mother said susan stooping to kiss her -- would you think it amiss if my father was to stay with us a week longer susan you don't say so he is indeed a whole week -- but how burning hot your hand is still are you sure he will stay inquired her mother how do you know who told you so tell me all quick attorney case told me so he can get him a week's longer leave of absence and he has promised he will god bless him for it for ever and ever said the poor woman joining her hands may the blessing of heaven be with him susan closed the curtains and was silent she could not say amen she was called out of the room at this moment for a messenger was come from the abbey for the bread-bills it was she who always made out the bills for though she had not a great number of lessons from the writing-master she had taken so much pains to learn that she could write a very neat legible hand and she found this very useful she was not to be sure particularly inclined to draw out a long bill at this instant but business must be done she set to work ruled her lines for the pounds shillings and pence made out the bill for the abbey and despatched the impatient messenger she then resolved to make out all the bills for the neighbours who had many of them taken a few loaves and rolls of her baking i had better get all my business finished said she to herself before i go down to the meadow to take leave of my poor lamb this was sooner said than done for she found that she had a great number of bills to write and the slate on which she had entered the account was not immediately to be found and when it was found the figures were almost rubbed out barbara had sat down upon it susan pored over the number of loaves and the names of the persons who took them and she wrote and cast up sums and corrected and re-corrected them till her head grew quite puzzled the table was covered with little square bits of paper on which she had been writing bills over and over again when her father came in with a bill in his hand how's this susan said he how can ye be so careless child what is your head running upon here look at the bill you were sending up to the abbey i met the messenger and luckily asked to see how much it was look at it susan looked and blushed it was written sir arthur somers to john price debtor six dozen lambs so much she altered it and returned it to her father but he had taken up some of the papers which lay upon the table what are all these child some of them are wrong and i've written them out again said susan some of them all of them i think seem to be wrong if i can read said her father rather angrily and he pointed out to her sundry strange mistakes her head indeed had been running upon her poor lamb she corrected all the mistakes with so much patience and bore to be blamed with so much good humour that her father at last said that it was impossible ever to scold susan without being in the wrong at the last as soon as all was set right price took the bills and said he would go round to the neighbours and collect the money himself for that he should be very proud to have it to say to them that it was all earned by his own little daughter susan resolved to keep the pleasure of telling him of his week's reprieve till he should come home to sup as he had promised to do in her mother's room she was not sorry to hear him sigh as he passed the knapsack which she had been packing up for his journey how delighted he will be when he hears the good news said she to herself but i know he will be a little sorry too for my poor lamb as susan had now settled all her business she thought she could have time to go down to the meadow by the river side to see her favourite but just as she had tied on her straw hat the village clock struck four and this was the hour at which she always went to fetch her little brothers home from a dame-school near the village she knew that they would be disappointed if she was later than usual and she did not like to keep them waiting because they were very patient good boys so she put off the visit to her lamb and went immediately for her brothers chapter ii ev'n in the spring and playtime of the year that calls th' unwonted villager abroad with all her little ones a sportive train to gather king-cups in the yellow mead and prink their heads with daisies cowper the dame-school which was about a mile from the hamlet was not a showy edifice but it was reverenced as much by the young race of village scholars as if it had been the most stately mansion in the land it was a low roofed long thatched tenement sheltered by a few reverend oaks under which many generations of hopeful children had gambolled in their turn the close shaven green which sloped down from the hatch-door of the schoolroom was paled round with a rude paling which though decayed in some parts by time was not in any place broken by violence the place bespoke order and peace the dame who governed was well obeyed because she was just and well beloved and because she was ever glad to give well earned praise and pleasure to her little subjects susan had once been under her gentle dominion and had been deservedly her favourite scholar the dame often cited her as the best example to the succeeding tribe of emulous youngsters she had scarcely opened the wicket which separated the green before the schoolroom door from the lane when she heard the merry voices of the children and saw the little troup issuing from the hatchway and spreading over the green oh there's susan cried her two little brothers running leaping and bounding up to her and many of the other rosy girls and boys crowded round her to talk of their plays for susan was easily interested in all that made others happy but she could not make them comprehend that if they all spoke at once it was not possible that she could hear what was said the voices were still raised one above another all eager to establish some important observation about ninepins or marbles or tops or bows and arrows when suddenly music was heard and the crowd was silenced the music seemed to be near the spot where the children were standing and they looked round to see whence it could come susan pointed to the great oak-tree and they beheld seated under its shade an old man playing upon his harp the children all approached -- at first timidly for the sounds were solemn but as the harper heard their little footsteps coming towards him he changed his hand and played one of his most lively tunes the circle closed and pressed nearer and nearer to him some who were in the foremost row whispered to each other he is blind what a pity and he looks very poor -- what a ragged coat he wears said others he must be very old for all his hair is white and he must have travelled a great way for his shoes are quite worn out observed another all these remarks were made whilst he was tuning his harp for when he once more began to play not a word was uttered he seemed pleased by their simple exclamations of wonder and delight and eager to amuse his young audience he played now a gay and now a pathetic air to suit their several humours susan's voice which was soft and sweet expressive of gentleness and good nature caught his ear the moment she spoke he turned his face eagerly to the place where she stood and it was observed that whenever she said that she liked any tune particularly he played it over again i am blind said the old man and cannot see your faces but i know you all asunder by your voices and i can guess pretty well at all your humours and characters by your voices can you so indeed cried susan's little brother william who had stationed himself between the old man's knees then you heard my sister susan speak just now can you tell us what sort of person she is that i can i think without being a conjurer said the old man lifting the boy up on his knee your sister susan is good-natured the boy clapped his hands and good-tempered right said little william with a louder clap of applause and very fond of the little boy who sits upon my knee o right right quite right exclaimed the child and quite right echoed on all sides but how came you to know so much when you are blind said william examining the old man attentively hush said john who was a year older than his brother and very sage you should not put him in mind of his being blind though i am blind said the harper i can hear you know and i heard from your sister herself all that i told you of her that she was good- tempered and good-natured and fond of you oh that's wrong -- you did not hear all that from herself i'm sure said john for nobody ever hears her praising herself did not i hear her tell you said the harper when you first came round me that she was in a great hurry to go home but that she would stay a little while since you wished it so much was not that good- natured and when you said you did not like the tune she liked best she was not angry with you but said 'then play william's first if you please ' -- was not that good-tempered oh interrupted william it's all true but how did you find out that she was fond of me that is such a difficult question said the harper that i must take time to consider the harper tuned his instrument as he pondered or seemed to ponder and at this instant two boys who had been searching for birds' nests in the hedges and who had heard the sound of the harp came blustering up and pushing their way through the circle one of them exclaimed what's going on here who are you my old fellow a blind harper well play us a tune if you can play ever a good one -- play me -- let's see what shall he play bob added he turning to his companion bumper squire jones the old man though he did not seem quite pleased with the peremptory manner of the request played as he was desired bumper squire jones and several other tunes were afterwards bespoke by the same rough and tyrannical voice the little children shrunk back in timid silence and eyed the brutal boy with dislike this boy was the son of attorney case and as his father had neglected to correct his temper when he was a child as he grew up it became insufferable all who were younger and weaker than himself dreaded his approach and detested him as a tyrant when the old harper was so tired that he could play no more a lad who usually carried his harp for him and who was within call came up and held his master's hat to the company saying will you be pleased to remember us the children readily produced their halfpence and thought their wealth well bestowed upon this poor good-natured man who had taken so much pains to entertain them better even than upon the gingerbread woman whose stall they loved to frequent the hat was held some time to the attorney's son before he chose to see it at last he put his hand surlily into his waistcoat pocket and pulled out a shilling there were sixpennyworth of halfpence in the hat i'll take these halfpence said he and here's a shilling for you god bless you sir said the lad but as he took the shilling which the young gentleman had slily put into the blind man's hand he saw that it was not worth one farthing i am afraid it is not good sir said the lad whose business it was to examine the money for his master i am afraid then you'll get no other said young case with an insulting laugh it never will do sir persisted the lad look at it yourself the edges are all yellow you can see the copper through it quite plain sir nobody will take it from us that's your affair said the brutal boy pushing away his hand you may pass it you know as well as i do if you look sharp you have taken it from me and i shan't take it back again i promise you a whisper of that's very unjust was heard the little assembly though under evident constraint could no longer suppress their indignation who says it's unjust cried the tyrant sternly looking down upon his judges susan's little brothers had held her gown fast to prevent her from moving at the beginning of this contest and she was now so much interested to see the end of it that she stood still without making any resistance is anyone here amongst yourselves a judge of silver said the old man yes here's the butcher's boy said the attorney's son show it to him he was a sickly-looking boy and of a remarkably peaceful disposition young case fancied that he would be afraid to give judgment against him however after some moments' hesitation and after turning the shilling round several times he pronounced that as far as his judgment went but he did not pretend to be a downright certain sure of it the shilling was not over and above good then to susan to screen himself from manifest danger for the attorney's son looked upon him with a vengeful mien but here's susan here who understands silver a great deal better than i do she takes a power of it for bread you know i'll leave it to her said the old harper if she says the shilling is good keep it jack the shilling was handed to susan who though she had with becoming modesty forborne all interference did not hesitate when she was called upon to speak the truth i think that this shilling is a bad one said she and the gentle but firm tone in which she pronounced the words for a moment awed and silenced the angry and brutal boy there's another then cried he i have sixpences and shillings too in plenty thank my stars susan now walked away with her two little brothers and all the other children separated to go to their several homes the old harper called to susan and begged that if she was going towards the village she would be so kind as to show him the way his lad took up his harp and little william took the old man by the hand i'll lead him i can lead him said he and john ran on before them to gather king-cups in the meadow there was a small rivulet which they had to cross and as a plank which served for a bridge over it was rather narrow susan was afraid to trust the old blind man to his little conductor she therefore went on the tottering plank first herself and then led the old harper carefully over they were now come to a gate which opened upon the high road to the village there is the high road straight before you said susan to the lad who was carrying his master's harp you can't miss it now i must bid you a good evening for i'm in a great hurry to get home and must go the short way across the fields here which would not be so pleasant for you because of the stiles good-bye the old harper thanked her and went along the high road whilst she and her brothers tripped on as fast as they could by the short way across the fields miss somers i am afraid will be waiting for us said susan you know she said she would call at six and by the length of our shadows i'm sure it is late when they came to their own cottage-door they heard many voices and they saw when they entered several ladies standing in the kitchen come in susan we thought you had quite forsaken us said miss somers to susan who advanced timidly i fancy you forgot that we promised to pay you a visit this evening but you need not blush so much about the matter there is no great harm done we have only been here about five minutes and we have been well employed in admiring your neat garden and your orderly shelves is it you susan who keeps these things in such nice order continued miss somers looking round the kitchen before susan could reply little william pushed forward and answered yes ma'am it is my sister susan that keeps everything neat and she always comes to school for us too which was what caused her to be so late because as how continued john she was loth to refuse us the hearing a blind man play on the harp it was we kept her and we hopes ma'am as you are -- as you seem so good you won't take it amiss miss somers and her sister smiled at the affectionate simplicity with which susan's little brothers undertook her defence and they were from this slight circumstance disposed to think yet more favourably of a family which seemed so well united they took susan along with them through the village many neighbours came to their doors and far from envying they all secretly wished susan well as she passed i fancy we shall find what we want here said miss somers stopping before a shop where unfolded sheets of pins and glass buttons glistened in the window and where rolls of many coloured ribbons appeared ranged in tempting order she went in and was rejoiced to see the shelves at the back of the counter well-furnished with glossy tiers of stuffs and gay neat printed linens and calicoes now susan choose yourself a gown said miss somers you set an example of industry and good conduct of which we wish to take public notice for the benefit of others the shopkeeper who was father to susan's friend rose looked much satisfied by this speech and as if a compliment had been paid to himself bowed low to miss somers and then with alertness which a london linen-draper might have admired produced piece after piece of his best goods to his young customer -- unrolled unfolded held the bright stuffs and calendered calicoes in various lights now stretched his arm to the highest shelves and brought down in a trice what seemed to be beyond the reach of any but a giant's arm now dived into some hidden recess beneath the counter and brought to light fresh beauties and fresh temptations susan looked on with more indifference than most of the spectators she was thinking much of her lamb and more of her father miss somers had put a bright guinea into her hand and had bid her pay for her own gown but susan as she looked at the guinea thought it was a great deal of money to lay out upon herself and she wished but did know like to ask that she might keep it for a better purpose some people are wholly inattentive to the lesser feelings and incapable of reading the countenances of those on whom they bestow their bounty miss somers and her sister were not of this roughly charitable class she does not like any of these things whispered miss somers to her sister her sister observed that susan looked as if her thoughts were far distant from gowns if you don't fancy any of these said the civil shopkeeper to susan we shall have a new assortment of calicoes for the spring season soon from town oh interrupted susan with a smile and a blush these are all pretty and too good for me but -- but what susan said miss somers tell us what is passing in your little mind susan hesitated well then we will not press you you are scarcely acquainted with us yet when you are you will not be afraid i hope to speak your mind put this shining yellow counter continued she pointing to the guinea in your pocket and make what use of it you please from what we know and from what we have heard of you we are persuaded that you will make a good use of it i think madam said the master of the shop with a shrewd good natured look i could give a pretty good guess myself what will become of that guinea but i say nothing no that is right said miss somers we leave susan entirely at liberty and now we will not detain her any longer good night susan we shall soon come again to your neat cottage susan curtsied with an expressive look of gratitude and with a modest frankness in her countenance which seemed to say i would tell you and welcome what i want to do with the guinea but i am not used to speak before so many people when you come to our cottage again you shall know all when susan had departed miss somers turned to the obliging shopkeeper who was folding up all the things he had opened you have had a great deal of trouble with us sir said she and since susan will not choose a gown for herself i must she selected the prettiest and whilst the man was rolling it in paper she asked him several questions about susan and her family which he was delighted to answer because he had now all opportunity of saying as much as he wished in her praise no later back ma'am than last may morning said he as my daughter rose was telling us susan did a turn in her quiet way by her mother that would not displease you if you were to hear it she was to have been queen of the may which in our little village amongst the younger tribe is a thing that is thought of a good deal but susan's mother was ill and susan after sitting up with her all night would not leave her in the morning even when they brought the crown to her she put the crown upon my daughter rose's head with her own hands and to be sure rose loves her as well as if she was her own sister but i don't speak from partiality for i am no relation whatever to the prices -- only a well-wisher as everyone i believe who knows them is i'll send the parcel up to the abbey shall i ma'am if you please said miss somers and as soon as you receive your new things from town let us know you will i hope find us good customers and well-wishers added she with a smile for those who wish well to their neighbours surely deserve to have well-wishers themselves a few words may encourage the benevolent passions and may dispose people to live in peace and happiness a few words may set them at variance and may lead to misery and lawsuits attorney case and miss somers were both equally convinced of this and their practice was uniformly consistent with their principles but now to return to susan she put the bright guinea carefully into the glove with the twelve shillings which she had received from her companions on may day besides this treasure she calculated that the amount of the bills for bread could not be less than eight or nine and thirty shillings and as her father was now sure of a week's reprieve she had great hopes that by some means or other it would be possible to make up the whole sum necessary to pay for a substitute if that could but be done said she to herself how happy would my mother be she would be quite stout again for she certainly is a great deal better since i told her that father would stay a week longer ah but she would not have blessed attorney case though if she had known about my poor daisy susan took the path that led to the meadow by the waterside resolved to go by herself and take leave of her innocent favourite but she did not pass by unperceived her little brothers were watching for her return and as soon as they saw her they ran after her and overtook her as she reached the meadow what did that good lady want with you cried william but looking up in his sister's face he saw tears in her eyes and he was silent and walked on quietly susan saw her lamb by the water-side who are those two men said william what are they going to do with daisy the two men were attorney case and the butcher the butcher was feeling whether the lamb was fat susan sat down upon the bank in silent sorrow her little brothers ran up to the butcher and demanded whether he was going to do any harm to the lamb the butcher did not answer but the attorney replied it is not your sister's lamb any longer it's mine -- mine to all intents and purposes yours cried the children with terror and will you kill it that's the butcher's business the little boys now burst into piercing lamentations they pushed away the butcher's hand they threw their arms round the neck of the lamb they kissed its forehead -- it bleated it will not bleat to-morrow said william and he wept bitterly the butcher looked aside and hastily rubbed his eyes with the corner of his blue apron the attorney stood unmoved he pulled up the head of the lamb which had just stooped to crop a mouthful of clover i have no time to waste said he butcher you'll account with me if it's fat -- the sooner the better i've no more to say and he walked off deaf to the prayers of the poor children as soon as the attorney was out of sight susan rose from the bank where she was seated came up to her lamb and stooped to gather some of the fresh dewy trefoil to let it eat out of her hand for the last time poor daisy licked her well known hand now let us go said susan i'll wait as long as you please said the butcher susan thanked him but walked away quickly without looking again at her lamb her little brothers begged the man to stay a few minutes for they had gathered a handful of blue speedwell and yellow crowsfoot and they were decking the poor animal as it followed the boys through the village the children collected as they passed and the butcher's own son was amongst the number susan's steadiness about the bad shilling was full in this boy's memory it had saved him a beating he went directly to his father to beg the life of susan's lamb i was thinking about it boy myself said the butcher it's a sin to kill a pet lamb i'm thinking -- any way it's what i'm not used to and don't fancy doing and i'll go and say as much to attorney case but he's a hard man there's but one way to deal with him and that's the way i must take though so be i shall be the loser thereby but we'll say nothing to the boys for fear it might be the thing would not take and then it would be worse again to poor susan who is a good girl and always was as well as she may being of a good breed and well reared from the first come lads don't keep a crowd and a scandal about my door continued he aloud to the children turn the lamb in here john in the paddock for to-night and go your ways home the crowd dispersed but murmured and the butcher went to the attorney seeing that all you want is a good fat tender lamb for a present for sir arthur as you told me said the butcher i could let you have what's as good or better for your purpose better -- if it's better i'm ready to hear reason the butcher had choice tender lamb he said fit to eat the next day and as mr case was impatient to make his offering to sir arthur he accepted the butcher's proposal though with such seeming reluctance that he actually squeezed out of him before he would complete the bargain a bribe of a fine sweetbread in the meantime susan's brothers ran home to tell her that her lamb was put into the paddock for the night this was all they knew and even this was some comfort to her rose her good friend was with her and she had before her the pleasure of telling her father of his week's reprieve her mother was better and even said she was determined to sit up to supper in her wicker armchair susan was getting this ready for supper when little william who was standing at the house door watching in the dusk for his father's return suddenly exclaimed susan if here is not our old man yes said the old harper i have found my way to you the neighbours were kind enough to show me whereabouts you lived for though i didn't know your name they guessed who i meant by what i said of you all susan came to the door and the old man was delighted to hear her speak again if it would not be too bold said he i'm a stranger in this part of the country and come from afar off my boy has got a bed for himself here in the village but i have no place could you be so charitable as to give an old blind man a night's lodging susan said she would step in and ask her mother and she soon returned with an answer that he was heartily welcome if he could sleep upon the children's bed which was but small the old man thankfully entered the hospitable cottage he struck his head against the low roof as he stepped over the doorsill many roofs that are twice as high are not half so good said he of this he had just had experience at the house of the attorney case while he had asked but had been roughly refused all assistance by miss barbara who was according to her usual custom standing staring at the hall door the old man's harp was set down in farmer price's kitchen and he promised to play a tune for the boys before they went to bed their mother giving them leave to sit up to supper with their father he came home with a sorrowful countenance but how soon did it brighten when susan with a smile said to him father we've good news for you good news for us all -- you have a whole week longer to stay with us and perhaps continued she putting her little purse into his hands -- perhaps with what's here and the bread bills and what may somehow be got together before a week's at an end we may make up the nine guineas for the substitute as they call him who knows dearest mother but we may keep him with us for ever as she spoke she threw her arms round her father who pressed her to his bosom without speaking for his heart was full he was some little time before he could perfectly believe that what he heard was true but the revived smiles of his wife the noisy joy of his little boys and the satisfaction that shone in susan's countenance convinced him that he was not in a dream as they sat down to supper the old harper was made welcome to his share of the cheerful though frugal meal susan's father as soon as supper was finished even before he would let the harper play a tune for his boys opened the little purse which susan had given him he was surprised at the sight of the twelve shillings and still more when he came to the bottom of the purse to see the bright golden guinea how did you come by all this money susan said he honestly and handsomely that i'm sure of beforehand said her proud mother but how i can't make out except by the baking hey susan is this your first baking oh no no said her father i have her first baking snug here besides in my pocket i kept it for a surprise to do your mother's heart good susan here's twenty-nine shillings and the abbey bill which is not paid yet comes to ten more what think you of this wife have we not a right to be proud of our susan why continued he turning to the harper i ask your pardon for speaking out so free before strangers in praise of my own which i know is not mannerly but the truth is the fittest thing to be spoken as i think at all times therefore here's your good health susan why by-and-by she'll be worth her weight in gold -- in silver at least but tell us child how came you by all this riches and how comes it that i don't go to-morrow all this happy news makes me so gay in myself i'm afraid i shall hardly understand it rightly but speak on child -- first bringing us a bottle of the good mead you made last year from your own honey susan did not much like to tell the history of her guinea-hen -- of the gown and of her poor lamb part of this would seem as if she was vaunting of her own generosity and part of it she did not like to recollect but her mother pressed to know the whole and she related it as simply as she could when she came to the story of her lamb her voice faltered and everybody present was touched the old harper sighed once and cleared his throat several times he then asked for his harp and after tuning it for a considerable time he recollected -- for he had often fits of absence -- that he sent for it to play the tune he had promised to the boys this harper came from a great distance from the mountains of wales to contend with several other competitors for a prize which had been advertised by a musical society about a year before this time there was to be a splendid ball given upon the occasion at shrewsbury which was about five miles from our village the prize was ten guineas for the best performer on the harp and the prize was now to be decided in a few days all this intelligence barbara had long since gained from her maid who often paid visits to the town of shrewsbury and she had long had her imagination inflamed with the idea of this splendid music-meeting and ball often had she sighed to be there and often had she revolved in her mind schemes for introducing herself to some genteel neighbours who might take her to the ball in their carriage how rejoiced how triumphant was she when this very evening just about the time when the butcher was bargaining with her father about susan's lamb a servant from the abbey rapped at the door and left a card for mr and miss barbara case there cried bab i and papa are to dine and drink tea at the abbey tomorrow who knows i daresay when they see that i'm not a vulgar person and all that and if i go cunningly to work with miss somers as i shall to be sure i daresay she'll take me to the ball with her to be sure said the maid it's the least one may expect from a lady who demeans herself to visit susan price and goes about a-shopping for her the least she can do for you is to take you in her carriage which costs nothing but is just a common civility to a ball then pray betty continued miss barbara don't forget to-morrow the first thing you do to send off to shrewsbury for my new bonnet i must have it to dine in at the abbey or the ladies will think nothing of me and betty remember the mantua-maker too i must see and coax papa to buy me a new gown against the ball i can see you know something of the fashions to-morrow at the abbey i shall look the ladies well over i promise you and betty i have thought of the most charming present for miss somers as papa says it's good never to go empty-handed to a great house i'll make miss somers who is fond as her maid told you of such things -- i'll make miss somers a present of that guinea-hen of susan's it's of no use to me so do you carry it up early in the morning to the abbey with my compliments that's the thing in full confidence that her present and her bonnet would operate effectually in her favour miss barbara paid her first visit at the abbey she expected to see wonders she was dressed in all the finery which she had heard from her maid who had heard from the 'prentice of a shrewsbury milliner was the thing in london and she was much surprised and disappointed when she was shown into the room where the miss somerses and the ladies of the abbey were sitting to see that they did not in any one part of their dress agree with the picture her imagination had formed of fashionable ladies she was embarrassed when she saw books and work and drawings upon the table and she began to think that some affront was meant to her because the company did not sit with their hands before them when miss somers endeavoured to find out conversation that would interest her and spoke of walks and flowers and gardening of which she was herself fond miss barbara still thought herself undervalued and soon contrived to expose her ignorance most completely by talking of things which she did not understand those who never attempt to appear what they are not -- those who do not in their manners pretend to anything unsuited to their habits and situation in life never are in danger of being laughed at by sensible well bred people of any rank but affectation is the constant and just object of ridicule miss barbara case with her mistaken airs of gentility aiming to be thought a woman and a fine lady whilst she was in reality a child and a vulgar attorney's daughter rendered herself so thoroughly ridiculous that the good natured yet discerning spectators were painfully divided between their sense of comic absurdity and a feeling of shame for one who could feel nothing for herself one by one the ladies dropped off miss somers went out of the room for a few minutes to alter her dress as it was the custom of the family before dinner she left a portfolio of pretty drawings and good prints for miss barbara's amusement but miss barbara's thoughts were so intent upon the harpers' ball that she could not be entertained with such trifles how unhappy are those who spend their time in expectation they can never enjoy the present moment whilst barbara was contriving means of interesting miss somers in her favour she recollected with surprise that not one word had yet been said of her present of the guinea-hen mrs betty in the hurry of her dressing her young lady in the morning had forgotten it but it came just whilst miss somers was dressing and the housekeeper came into her mistress' room to announce its arrival ma'am said she here's a beautiful guinea-hen just come with miss barbara case's compliments to you miss somers knew by the tone which the housekeeper delivered this message that there was something in the business which did not perfectly please her she made no answer in expectation that the housekeeper who was a woman of a very open temper would explain her cause of dissatisfaction in this she was not mistaken the housekeeper came close up to the dressing table and continued i never like to speak till i'm sure ma'am and i'm not quite sure to say certain in this case ma'am but still i think it right to tell you which can't wrong anybody what came across my mind about this same guinea-hen ma'am and you can inquire into it and do as you please afterwards ma'am some time ago we had fine guinea-fowls of our own and i made bold not thinking to be sure that all our own would die away from us as they have done to give a fine couple last christmas to susan price and very fond and pleased she was at the time and i'm sure would never have parted with the hen with her good-will but if my eyes don't strangely mistake this hen that comes from miss barbara is the selfsame identical guinea-hen that i gave to susan and how miss bab came by it is the thing that puzzles me if my boy philip was at home maybe as he's often at mrs price's which i don't disapprove he might know the history of the guinea-hen i expect him home this night and if you have no objection i will sift the affair the shortest way i think said henrietta would be to ask miss case herself about it which i will do this evening if you please ma'am said the housekeeper coldly for she knew that miss barbara was not famous in the village for speaking truth dinner was now served attorney case expected to smell mint sauce and as the covers were taken from off the dishes looked around for lamb but no lamb appeared he had a dexterous knack of twisting the conversation to his point sir arthur was speaking when they sat down to dinner of a new carving knife which he lately had had made for his sister the attorney immediately went from carving-knives to poultry thence to butcher's meat some joints he observed were much more difficult to carve than others he never saw a man carve better than the gentleman opposite him who was the curate of the parish but sir said the vulgar attorney i must make bold to differ with you in one point and i'll appeal to sir arthur sir arthur pray may i ask when you carve a forequarter of lamb do you when you raise the shoulder throw in salt or not this well prepared question was not lost upon sir arthur the attorney was thanked for his intended present but mortified and surprised to hear sir arthur say that it was a constant rule of his never to accept of any presents from his neighbours if we were to accept a lamb from a rich neighbour on my estate said he i am afraid we should mortify many of our poor tenants who can have little to offer though perhaps they may bear us thorough good-will notwithstanding after the ladies left the dining-room as they were walking up and down the large hall miss barbara had a fair opportunity of imitating her keen father's method of conversing one of the ladies observed that this hall would be a charming place for music bab brought in harps and harpers and the harpers' ball in a breath i know so much about it -- about the ball i mean said she because a lady in shrewsbury a friend of papa's offered to take me with her but papa did not like to give her the trouble of sending so far for me though she has a coach of her own barbara fixed her eyes upon miss somers as she spoke but she could not read her countenance as distinctly as she wished because miss somers was at this moment letting down the veil of her hat shall we walk out before tea said miss somers to her companions i have a pretty guinea-hen to show you barbara secretly drawing propitious omens from the guinea-hen followed with a confidential step the pheasantry was well filled with pheasants peacocks etc and susan's pretty little guinea-hen appeared well even in this high company it was much admired barbara was in glory but her glory was of short duration just as miss somers was going to inquire into the guinea-hen's history philip came up to ask permission to have a bit of sycamore to turn a nutmeg box for his mother he was an ingenious lad and a good turner for his age sir arthur had put by a bit of sycamore on purpose for him and miss somers told him where it was to be found he thanked her but in the midst of his bow of thanks his eye was struck by the sight of the guinea-hen and he involuntarily exclaimed susan's guinea-hen i declare no it's not susan's guinea-hen said miss barbara colouring furiously it is mine and i have made a present of it to miss somers at the sound of bab's voice philip turned -- saw her -- and indignation unrestrained by the presence of all the amazed spectators flashed in his countenance what is the matter philip said miss somers in a pacifying tone but philip was not inclined to be pacified why ma'am said he may i speak out and without waiting for permission he spoke out and gave a full true and warm account of rose's embassy and of miss barbara's cruel and avaricious proceedings barbara denied prevaricated stammered and at last was overcome with confusion for which even the most indulgent spectators could scarcely pity her miss somers however mindful of what was due to her guest was anxious to dispatch philip for his piece of sycamore bab recovered herself as soon as he was out of sight but she further exposed herself by exclaiming i'm sure i wish this pitiful guinea-hen had never come into my possession i wish susan had kept it at home as she should have done perhaps she will be more careful now that she has received so strong a lesson said miss somers shall we try her continued she philip will i daresay take the guinea-hen back to susan if we desire it if you please ma'am said barbara sullenly i have nothing more to do with it so the guinea-hen was delivered to philip who set off joyfully with his prize and was soon in sight of farmer price's cottage he stopped when he came to the door he recollected rose and her generous friendship for susan he was determined that she should have the pleasure of restoring the guinea-hen he ran into the village all the children who had given up their little purse on may day were assembled on the play-green they were delighted to see the guinea-hen once more philip took his pipe and tabor and they marched in innocent triumph towards the whitewashed cottage let me come with you -- let me come with you said the butcher's boy to philip stop one minute my father has something to say to you he darted into his father's house the little procession stopped and in a few minutes the bleating of a lamb was heard through a back passage which led into the paddock behind the house they saw the butcher leading a lamb it is daisy exclaimed rose -- it's daisy repeated all her companions susan's lamb susan's lamb and there was a universal shout of joy well for my part said the good butcher as soon as he could be heard -- for my part i would not be so cruel as attorney case for the whole world these poor brute beasts don't know aforehand what's going to happen to them and as for dying it's what we must all do some time or another but to keep wringing the hearts of the living that have as much sense as one's self is what i call cruel and is not this what attorney case has been doing by poor susan and her whole family ever since he took a spite against them but at anyrate here's susan's lamb safe and sound i'd have taken it back sooner but i was off before day to the fair and am but just come back daisy however has been as well off in my paddock as he would have been in the field by the waterside the obliging shopkeeper who showed the pretty calicoes to susan was now at his door and when he saw the lamb and heard that it was susan's and learned its history he said that he would add his mite and he gave the children some ends of narrow riband with which rose decorated her friend's lamb the pipe and tabor now once more began to play and the procession moved on in joyful order after giving the humane butcher three cheers three cheers which were better deserved than loud huzzas usually are susan was working in her arbour with her little deal table before her when she heard the sound of the music she put down her work and listened she saw the crowd of children coming nearer and nearer they had closed round daisy so that she did not see it but as they came up to the garden gate she saw that rose beckoned to her philip played as loud as he could that she might not hear till the proper moment the bleating of the lamb susan opened the garden-wicket and at this signal the crowd divided and the first thing that susan saw in the midst of her taller friends was little smiling mary with the guinea-hen in her arms come on come on cried mary as susan started with joyful surprise you have more to see at this instant the music paused susan heard the bleating of a lamb and scarcely daring to believe her senses she pressed eagerly forward and beheld poor daisy -- she burst into tears i did not shed one tear when i parted with you my dear little daisy said she it was for my father and mother i would not have parted with you for anything else in the whole world thank you thank you all added she to her companions who sympathized in her joy even more than they had sympathized in her sorrow now if my father was not to go away from us next week and if my mother was quite stout i should be the happiest person in the world as susan pronounced these words a voice behind the little listening crowd cried in a brutal tone let us pass if you please you have no right to stop up the public road this was the voice of attorney case who was returning with his daughter barbara from his visit to the abbey he saw the lamb and tried to whistle as he went on barbara also saw the guinea-hen and turned her head another way that she might avoid the contemptuous reproachful looks of those whom she only affected to despise even her new bonnet in which she had expected to be so much admired was now only serviceable to hide her face and conceal her mortification i am glad she saw the guinea-hen cried rose who now held it in her hands yes said philip she'll not forget may day in a hurry nor i neither i hope said susan looking round upon her companions with a most affectionate smile i hope whilst i live i shall never forget your goodness to me last may day now i've my pretty guinea-hen safe once more i should think of returning your money no no no was the general cry we don't want the money -- keep it keep it -- you want it for your father well said susan i am not too proud to be obliged i will keep your money for my father perhaps some time or other i may be able to earn -- oh interrupted philip don't let us talk of earning don't let us talk to her of money now she has not had time hardly to look at poor daisy and her guinea-hen come we must go about our business and let her have them all to herself the crowd moved away in consequence of philip's considerate advice but it was observed that he was the very last to stir from the garden-wicket himself he stayed first to inform susan that it was rose who tied the ribands on daisy's head then he stayed a little longer to let her into the history of the guinea-hen and to tell her who it was that brought the hen home from the abbey rose held the sieve and susan was feeding her long lost favourite whilst philip leaned over the wicket prolonging his narration now my pretty guinea-hen said susan -- my naughty guinea-hen that flew away from me you shall never serve me so again i must cut your nice wings but i won't hurt you take care cried philip you'd better indeed you'd better let me hold her whilst you cut her wings when this operation was successfully performed which it certainly could never have been if philip had not held the hen for susan he recollected that his mother had sent him with a message to mrs price this message led to another quarter of an hour's delay for he had the whole history of the guinea-hen to tell over again to mrs price and the farmer himself luckily came in whilst it was going on so it was but civil to begin it afresh and then the farmer was so rejoiced to see his susan so happy again with her two little favourites that he declared he must see daisy fed himself and philip found that he was wanted to hold the jug full of milk out of which farmer price filled the pan for daisy happy daisy who lapped at his ease whilst susan caressed him and thanked her fond father and her pleased mother but philip said mrs price i'll hold the jug -- you'll be late with your message to your mother we'll not detain you any longer philip departed and as he went out of the garden-wicket he looked up and saw bab and her maid betty staring out of the window as usual on this he immediately turned back to try whether he had shut the gate fast lest the guinea-hen might stray out and fall again into the hands of the enemy miss barbara in the course of this day felt considerable mortification but no contrition she was vexed that her meanness was discovered but she felt no desire to cure herself of any of her faults the ball was still uppermost in her vain selfish soul well said she to her confidante betty you hear how things have turned out but if miss somers won't think of asking me to go out with her i've a notion i know who will as papa says it's a good thing to have two strings to one's bow now some officers who were quartered at shrewsbury had become acquainted with mr case they had gotten into some quarrel with a tradesman of the town and attorney case had promised to bring them through the affair as the man threatened to take the law of them upon the faith of this promise and with the vain hope that by civility they might dispose him to bring in a reasonable bill of costs these officers sometimes invited mr case to the mess and one of them who had lately been married prevailed upon his bride sometimes to take a little notice of miss barbara it was with this lady that miss barbara now hoped to go to the harpers' ball the officers and mrs strathspey or more properly mrs strathspey and the officers are to breakfast here tomorrow do you know said bab to betty one of them dined at the abbey to-day and told papa that they'd all come they are going out on a party somewhere into the country and breakfast here on their way pray betty don't forget that mrs strathspey can't breakfast without honey i heard her say so myself then indeed said betty i'm afraid mrs strathspey will be likely to go without her breakfast here for not a spoonful of honey have we let her long for it ever so much but surely said bab we can contrive to get some honey in the neighbourhood there's none to be bought as i know of said betty but is there none to be begged or borrowed said bab laughing do you forget susan's beehive step over to her in the morning with my compliments and see what you can do tell her it's for mrs strathspey in the morning betty went with miss barbara's compliments to susan to beg some honey for mrs strathspey who could not breakfast without it susan did not like to part with her honey because her mother loved it and she therefore gave betty but a small quantity when barbara saw how little susan sent she called her a miser and she said she must have some more for mrs strathspey i'll go myself and speak to her come with me betty said the young lady who found it at present convenient to forget her having declared the day that she sucked up the broth that she never would honour susan with another visit susan said she accosting the poor girl whom she had done everything in her power to injure i must beg a little more honey from you for mrs strathspey's breakfast you know on a particular occasion such as this neighbours must help one another to be sure they should added betty susan though she was generous was not weak she was willing to give to those she loved but not disposed to let anything be taken from her or coaxed out of her by those she had reason to despise she civilly answered that she was sorry she had no more honey to spare barbara grew angry and lost all command of herself when she saw that susan without regarding her reproaches went on looking through the glass pane in the beehive i'll tell you what susan price said she in a high tone the honey i will have so you may as well give it to me by fair means yes or no speak will you give it me or not will you give me that piece of the honey-comb that lies there that bit of honey-comb is for my mother's breakfast said susan i cannot give it you can't you said bab then see if i don't take it she stretched across susan for the honey-comb which was lying by some rosemary leaves that susan had freshly gathered for her mother's tea bab grasped but at her first effort she only reached the rosemary she made a second dart at the honey-comb and in her struggle to obtain it she overset the beehive the bees swarmed about her her maid betty screamed and ran away susan who was sheltered by a laburnum tree called to barbara upon whom the black clusters of bees were now settling and begged her to stand still and not to beat them away if you stand quietly you won't be stung perhaps but instead of standing quietly bab buffeted and stamped and roared and the bees stung her terribly her arms and her face swelled in a frightful manner she was helped home by poor susan and treacherous mrs betty who now the mischief was done thought only of exculpating herself to her master indeed miss barbara said she this was quite wrong of you to go and get yourself into such a scrape i shall be turned away for it you'll see i don't care whether you are turned away or not said barbara i never felt such pain in my life can't you do something for me i don't mind the pain either so much as being such a fright pray how am i to be fit to be seen at breakfast by mrs strathspey and i suppose i can't go to the ball either to-morrow after all no that you can't expect to do indeed said betty the comforter you need not think of balls for those lumps and swellings won't go off your face this week that's not what pains me but i'm thinking of what your papa will say to me when he sees you miss whilst this amiable mistress and maid were in their adversity reviling one another susan when she saw that she could be of no further use was preparing to depart but at the house-door she was met by mr case mr case had revolved things in his mind for his second visit at the abbey pleased him as little as his first owing to a few words which sir arthur and miss somers dropped in speaking of susan and farmer price mr case began to fear that he had mistaken his game in quarrelling with this family the refusal of his present dwelt upon the attorney's mind and he was aware that if the history of susan's lamb ever reached the abbey he was undone he now thought that the most prudent course he could possibly follow would be to hush up matters with the prices with all convenient speed consequently when he met susan at his door he forced a gracious smile how is your mother susan said he is there anything in our house can be of service to her on hearing his daughter he cried out barbara barbara -- bab come downstairs child and speak to susan price but as no barbara answered her father stalked upstairs directly opened the door and stood amazed at the spectacle of her swelled visage betty instantly began to tell the story of barbara's mishap her own way bab contradicted her as fast as she spoke the attorney turned the maid away on the spot and partly with real anger and partly with feigned affectation of anger he demanded from his daughter how she dared to treat susan price so ill when as he said she was so neighbourly and obliging as to give you some of her honey couldn't you be content without seizing upon the honey-comb by force this is scandalous behaviour and what i assure you i can't countenance susan now interceded for barbara and the attorney softening his voice said that susan was a great deal too good to her as you are indeed added he to everybody i forgive her for your sake susan curtsied in great surprise but her lamb could not be forgotten and she left the attorney's house as soon as she could to make her mother's rosemary tea breakfast mr case saw that susan was not so simple as to be taken in by a few fair words his next attempt was to conciliate farmer price the farmer was a blunt honest man and his countenance remained inflexibly contemptuous when the attorney addressed him in his softest tone so stood matters the day of the long expected harpers' ball miss barbara case stung by susan's bees could not after all her manoeuvres go with mrs strathspey to the ball the ballroom was filled early in the evening there was a numerous assembly the harpers who contended for the prize were placed under the music-gallery at the lower end of the room amongst them was our old blind friend who as he was not so well clad as his competitors seemed to be disdained by many of the spectators six ladies and six gentlemen were now appointed to be judges of the performance they were seated in a semicircle opposite to the harpers the miss somerses who were fond of music were amongst the ladies in the semicircle and the prize was lodged in the hands of sir arthur there was now silence the first harp sounded and as each musician tried his skill the audience seemed to think that each deserved the prize the old blind man was the last he tuned his instrument and such a simple pathetic strain was heard as touched every heart all were fixed in delighted attention and when the music ceased the silence for some moments continued the silence was followed by a universal buzz of applause the judges were unanimous in their opinions and it was declared that the old blind harper who played the last deserved the prize the simple pathetic air which won the suffrages of the whole assembly was his own composition he was pressed to give the words belonging to the music and at last he modestly offered to repeat them as he could not see to write miss somers' ready pencil was instantly produced and the old harper dictated the words of his ballad which he called -- susan's lamentation for her lamb miss somers looked at her brother from time to time as she wrote and sir arthur as soon as the old man had finished took him aside and asked him some questions which brought the whole history of susan's lamb and of attorney case's cruelty to light the attorney himself was present when the harper began to dictate his ballad his colour as sir arthur steadily looked at him varied continually till at length when he heard the words susan's lamentation for her lamb he suddenly shrunk back skulked through the crowd and disappeared we shall not follow him we had rather follow our old friend the victorious harper no sooner had he received the ten guineas his well merited prize than he retired to a small room belonging to the people of the house asked for pen ink and paper and dictated in a low voice to his boy who was a tolerably good scribe a letter which he ordered him to put directly into the shrewsbury post-office the boy ran with the letter to the post-office he was but just in time for the postman's horn was sounding the next morning when farmer price his wife and susan were sitting together reflecting that his week's leave of absence was nearly at an end and that the money was not yet made up for john simpson the substitute a knock was heard at the door and the person who usually delivered the letters in the village put a letter into susan's hand saying a penny if you please -- here's a letter for your father for me said farmer price here's the penny then but who can it be from i wonder who can think of writing to me in this world he tore open the letter but the hard name at the bottom of the page puzzled him- - your obliged friend llewellyn and what's this said he opening a paper that was inclosed in the letter it's a song seemingly it must be somebody that has a mind to make an april fool of me but it is not april it is may father said susan well let us read the letter and we shall come to the truth all in good time farmer price sat down in his own chair for he could not read entirely to his satisfaction in any other and read as follows -- my worthy friend -- i am sure you will be glad to hear that i have had good success this night i have won the ten guinea prize and for that i am in a great measure indebted to your sweet daughter susan as you will see by a little ballad i inclose for her your hospitality to me has afforded to me an opportunity of learning some of your family history you do not i hope forget that i was present when you were counting the treasure in susan's little purse and that i heard for what purpose it was all destined you have not i know yet made up the full sum for your substitute john simpson therefore do me the favour to use the five guinea bank note which you will find within the ballad you shall not find me as hard a creditor as attorney case pay me the money at your own convenience if it is never convenient to you to pay it i shall never ask it i shall go my rounds again through this country i believe about this time next year and will call to see how you do and to play the new tune for susan and the dear little boys i should just add to set your heart at rest about the money that it does not distress me at all to lend it to you i am not quite so poor as i appear to be but it is my humour to go about as i do i see more of the world under my tattered garb than perhaps i should ever see in a better dress there are many of my profession who are of the same mind as myself in this respect and we are glad when it lies in our way to do any kindness to such a worthy family as yours -- so fare ye well your obliged friend llewellyn susan now by her father's desire opened the ballad he picked up the five guinea bank note whilst she read with surprise susan's lamentation for her lamb her mother leaned over her shoulder to read the words but they were interrupted before they had finished the first stanza by another knock at the door it was not the postman with another letter it was sir arthur and his sisters they came with an intention which they were much disappointed to find that the old harper had rendered vain -- they came to lend the farmer and his good family the money to pay for his substitute but since we are here said sir arthur let me do my own business which i had like to have forgotten mr price will you come out with me and let me show you a piece of your land through which i want to make a road look there said sir arthur pointing to the spot i am laying out a ride round my estate and that bit of land of yours stops me why sir said price the land's mine to be sure for that matter but i hope you don't look upon me to be that sort of person that would be stiff about a trifle or so the fact is said sir arthur i had heard you were a litigious pig- headed fellow but you do not seem to deserve this character hope not sir said the farmer but about the matter of the land i don't want to take any advantage of your wishing for it you are welcome to it and i leave it to you to find me out another bit of land convenient to me that will be worth neither more nor less or else to make up the value to me some way or other i need say no more about it i hear something continued sir arthur after a short silence -- i hear something mr price of a flaw in your lease i would not speak to you about it whilst we were bargaining about your land lest i should over- awe you but tell me what is this flaw in truth and the truth is the fittest thing to be spoken at all times said the farmer i didn't know myself what a flaw as they call it meant till i heard of the word from attorney case and i take it a flaw is neither more nor less than a mistake as one should say now by reason a man does not make a mistake on purpose it seems to me to be the fair thing that if a man finds out his mistake he might set it right but attorney case says this is not law and i've no more to say the man who drew up my lease made a mistake and if i must suffer for it i must said the farmer however i can show you sir arthur just for my own satisfaction and yours a few lines of a memorandum on a slip of paper which was given me by your relation the gentleman who lived here before and let me my farm you'll see by that bit of paper what was meant but the attorney says the paper's not worth a button in a court of justice and i don't understand these things all i understand is the common honesty of the matter i've no more to say this attorney whom you speak of so often said sir arthur you seem to have some quarrel with now would you tell me frankly what is the matter between -- the matter between us then said price is a little bit of ground not worth much that is there open to the lane at the end of mr case's garden sir and he wanted to take it in now i told him my mind that it belonged to the parish and that i never would willingly give my consent to his cribbing it in that way sir i was the more loath to see it shut into his garden which moreover is large enough of all conscience without it because you must know sir arthur the children in our village are fond of making a little play-green of it and they have a custom of meeting on may day at a hawthorn that stands in the middle of it and altogether i was very loath to see 'em turned out of it by those who have no right let us go and see this nook said sir arthur it is not far off is it oh no sir just hard by here when they got to the ground mr case who saw them walking together was in a hurry to join them that he might put a stop to any explanations explanations were things of which he had a great dread but fortunately he was upon this occasion a little too late is this the nook in dispute said sir arthur yes this is the whole thing said price why sir arthur interposed the politic attorney with an assumed air of generosity don't let us talk any more about it let it belong to whom it will i give it up to you so great a lawyer mr case as you are replied sir arthur must know that a man cannot give up that to which he has no legal title and in this case it is impossible that with the best intentions to oblige me in the world you can give up this bit of land to me because it is mine already as i can convince you effectually by a map of the adjoining land which i have fortunately safe amongst my papers this piece of ground belonged to the farm on the opposite side of the road and it was cut off when the lane was made very possibly i daresay you are quite correct you must know best said the attorney trembling for the agency then said sir arthur mr price you will observe that i now promise this little green to the children for a play-ground and i hope they may gather hawthorn many a may day at this their favourite bush mr price bowed low which he seldom did even when he received a favour himself and now mr case said sir arthur turning to the attorney who did not know which way to look you sent me a lease to look over ye-ye-yes stammered mr case i thought it my duty to do so not out of any malice or ill-will to this good man you have done him no injury said sir arthur coolly i am ready to make him a new lease whenever he pleases of his farm and i shall be guided by a memorandum of the original bargain which he has in his possession i hope i never shall take an unfair advantage of anyone heaven forbid sir said the attorney sanctifying his face that i should suggest the taking an unfair advantage of any man rich or poor but to break a bad lease is not taking an unfair advantage you really think so said sir arthur certainly i do and i hope i have not hazarded your good opinion by speaking my mind concerning the flaw so plainly i always understood that there could be nothing ungentlemanlike in the way of business in taking advantage of a flaw in a lease now said sir arthur you have pronounced judgment undesignedly in your own case you intended to send me this poor man's lease but your son by some mistake brought me your own and i have discovered a fatal error in it a fatal error said the alarmed attorney yes sir said sir arthur pulling the lease out of his pocket here it is you will observe that it is neither signed nor sealed by the grantor but you won't take advantage of me surely sir arthur said mr case forgetting his own principles i shall not take advantage of you as you would have taken of this honest man in both cases i shall be guided by memoranda which i have in my possession i shall not mr case defraud you of one shilling of your property i am ready at a fair valuation to pay the exact value of your house and land but upon this condition -- that you quit the parish within one month attorney case was thus compelled to submit to the hard necessity of the case for he knew that he could not legally resist indeed he was glad to be let off so easily and he bowed and sneaked away secretly comforting himself with the hope that when they came to the valuation of the house and land he should be the gainer perhaps of a few guineas his reputation he justly held very cheap you are a scholar you write a good hand you can keep accounts cannot you said sir arthur to mr price as they walked home towards the cottage i think i saw a bill of your little daughter's drawing out the other day which was very neatly written did you teach her to write no sir said price i can't say i did that for she mostly taught it herself but i taught her a little arithmetic as far as i knew on our winter nights when i had nothing better to do your daughter shows that she has been well taught said sir arthur and her good conduct and good character speak strongly in favour of her parents you are very good very good indeed sir to speak in this sort of way said the delighted father but i mean to do more than pay you with words said sir arthur you are attached to your own family perhaps you may become attached to me when you come to know me and we shall have frequent opportunities of judging of one another i want no agent to squeeze my tenants or do my dirty work i only want a steady intelligent honest man like you to collect my rents and i hope mr price you will have no objection to the employment i hope sir said price with joy and gratitude glowing in his honest countenance that you'll never have cause to repent your goodness and what are my sisters about here said sir arthur entering the cottage and going behind his sisters who were busily engaged in measuring an extremely pretty coloured calico it is for susan my dear brother said they i know she did not keep that guinea for herself said miss somers i have just prevailed upon her mother to tell me what became of it susan gave it to her father but she must not refuse a gown of our choosing this time and i am sure she will not because her mother i see likes it and susan i hear that instead of becoming queen of the may this year you were sitting in your sick mother's room your mother has a little colour in her cheeks now oh ma'am interrupted mrs price i'm quite well joy i think has made me quite well then said miss somers i hope you will be able to come out on your daughter's birthday which i hear is the 25th of this month make haste and get quite well before that day for my brother intends that all the lads and lassies of the village shall have a dance on susan's birthday yes said sir arthur and i hope on that day susan you will be very happy with your little friends upon their play-green i shall tell them that it is your good conduct which has obtained it for them and if you have anything to ask any little favour for any of your companions which we can grant now ask susan these ladies look as if they would not refuse you anything that is reasonable and i think you look as if you would not ask anything unreasonable sir said susan after consulting her mother's eyes there is to be sure a favour i should like to ask it is for rose well i don't know who rose is said sir arthur smiling but go on ma'am you have seen her i believe she is a very good girl indeed said mrs price and works very neatly indeed continued susan eagerly to miss somers and she and her mother heard you were looking out for someone to wait upon you say no more said miss somers your wish is granted tell rose to come to the abbey to-morrow morning or rather come with her yourself for our housekeeper i know wants to talk to you about a certain cake she wishes susan that you should be the maker of the cake for the dance and she has good things ready looked out for it already i know it must be large enough for everybody to have a slice and the housekeeper will ice it for you i only hope your cake will be as good as your bread fare ye well how happy are those who bid farewell to a whole family silent with gratitude who will bless them aloud when they are far out of hearing how do i wish now said farmer price and it's almost a sin for one that has had such a power of favours done him to wish for anything more but how i do wish wife that our good friend the harper was only here at this time it would do his old warm heart good well the best of it is we shall be able next year when he comes his rounds to pay him his money with thanks being all the time and for ever as much obliged to him as if we kept it i long so i do to see him in this house again drinking as he did just in this spot a glass of susan's mead to her very good health yes said susan and the next time he comes i can give him one of my guinea-hen's eggs and i shall show my lamb daisy true love said her mother and he will play that tune and sing that pretty ballad where is it for i have not finished it rose ran away with it mother but i'll step after her and bring it back to you this minute said susan susan found her friend rose at the hawthorn in the midst of a crowded circle of her companions to whom she was reading susan's lamentation for her lamb the words are something but the tune -- the tune -- i must have the tune cried philip i'll ask my mother to ask sir arthur to try and find out which way that good old man went after the ball and if he's above ground we'll have him back by susan's birthday and he shall sit here -- just exactly here by this our bush and he shall play -- i mean if he pleases -- that same tune for us and i shall learn it -- i mean if i can -- in a minute the good news that farmer price was to be employed to collect the rents and that attorney case was to leave the parish in a month soon spread over the village many came out of their houses to have the pleasure of hearing the joyful tidings confirmed by susan herself the crowd on the play-green increased every minute yes cried the triumphant philip i tell you it's all true every word of it susan's too modest to say it herself but i tell ye all sir arthur gave us this play-green for ever on account of her being so good you see at last attorney case with all his cunning has not proved a match for simple susan the white pigeon the little town of somerville in ireland has within these few years assumed the neat and cheerful appearance of an english village mr somerville to whom this town belongs wished to inspire his tenantry with a taste for order and domestic happiness and took every means in his power to encourage industrious well behaved people to settle in his neighbourhood when he had finished building a row of good slated houses in his town he declared that he would let them to the best tenants he could find and proposals were publicly sent to him from all parts of the country by the best tenants mr somerville did not however mean the best bidders and many who had offered an extravagant price for the houses were surprised to find their proposals rejected amongst these was mr cox an alehouse keeper who did not bear a very good character please your honour sir said he to mr somerville i expected since i bid as fair and fairer for it than any other that you would have let me the house next the apothecary's was not it fifteen guineas i mentioned in my proposal and did not your honour give it against me for thirteen my honour did just so replied mr somerville calmly and please your honour but i don't know what it is i or mine have done to offend you i'm sure there is not a gentleman in all ireland i'd go further to sarve would not i go to cork to-morrow for the least word from your honour i am much obliged to you mr cox but i have no business at cork at present answered mr somerville drily it is all i wish exclaimed mr cox that i could find out and light upon the man that has belied me to your honour no man has belied you mr cox but your nose belies you much if you do not love drinking a little and your black eye and cut chin belie you much if you do not love quarrelling a little quarrel i quarrel please your honour i defy any man or set of men ten mile round to prove such a thing and i am ready to fight him that dares to say the like of me i'd fight him here in your honour's presence if he'd only come out this minute and meet me like a man here mr cox put himself into a boxing attitude but observing that mr somerville looked at his threatening gesture with a smile and that several people who had gathered round him as he stood in the street laughed at the proof he gave of his peaceable disposition he changed his attitude and went on to vindicate himself against the charge of drinking and as to drink please your honour there's no truth in it not a drop of whisky good or bad have i touched these six months except what i took with jemmy m'doole the night i had the misfortune to meet your honour coming home from the fair of ballynagrish to this speech mr somerville made no answer but turned away to look at the bow window of a handsome new inn which the glazier was at this instant glazing please your honour that new inn is not let i hear as yet resumed mr cox if your honour recollects you promised to make me a compliment of it last seraphtide was twelvemonth impossible cried mr somerville for i had no thoughts of building an inn at that time oh i beg your honour's pardon but if you'd be just pleased to recollect it was coming through the gap in the bog meadows forenent thady o'connor you made me the promise -- i'll leave it to him so i will but i will not leave it to him i assure you cried mr somerville i never made any such promise i never thought of letting this inn to you then your honour won't let me have it no you have told me a dozen falsehoods i do not wish to have you for a tenant well god bless your honour i've no more to say but god bless your honour said mr cox and he walked away muttering to himself as he slouched his hat over his face i hope i'll live to be revenged on him mr somerville the next morning went with his family to look at the new inn which he expected to see perfectly finished but he was met by the carpenter who with a rueful face informed him that six panes of glass in the large bow-window had been broken during the night ha perhaps mr cox has broken my windows in revenge for my refusing to let him my house said mr somerville and many of the neighbours who knew the malicious character of this mr cox observed that this was like one of his tricks a boy of about twelve years old however stepped forward and said i don't like mr cox i'm sure for once he beat me when he was drunk but for all that no one should be accused wrongfully he could not be the person that broke these windows last night for he was six miles off he slept at his cousin's last night and he has not returned home yet so i think he knows nothing of the matter mr somerville was pleased with the honest simplicity of this boy and observing that he looked in eagerly at the staircase when the house door was opened he asked him whether he would like to go in and see the new house yes sir said the boy i should like to go up those stairs and to see what i should come to up with you then said mr somerville and the boy ran up the stairs he went from room to room with great expressions of admiration and delight at length as he was examining one of the garrets he was startled by a fluttering noise over his head and looking up he saw a white pigeon who frightened at his appearance began to fly round and round the room till it found its way out of the door and flew into the staircase the carpenter was speaking to mr somerville upon the landing-place of the stairs but the moment he spied the white pigeon he broke off in the midst of a speech about the nose of the stairs and exclaimed there he is please your honour there's he that has done all the damage to our bow-window -- that's the very same wicked white pigeon that broke the church windows last sunday was se'nnight but he's down for it now we have him safe and i'll chop his head off as he deserves this minute stay o stay don't chop his head off he does not deserve it cried the boy who came running out of the garret with the greatest eagerness -- i broke your window sir said he to mr somerville i broke your window with this ball but i did not know that i had done it till this moment i assure you or i should have told you before don't chop his head off added the boy to the carpenter who had now the white pigeon in his hands no said mr somerville the pigeon's head shall not be chopped off nor yours either my good boy for breaking a window i am persuaded by your open honest countenance that you are speaking the truth but pray explain this matter to us for you have not made it quite clear how happened it that you could break my windows without knowing it and how came you to find it out at last sir said the boy if you'll come up here i'll show you all i know and how i came to know it mr somerville followed the boy into the garret who pointed to a pane of glass that was broken in a small window that looked out upon a piece of waste ground behind the house upon this piece of waste ground the children of the village often used to play we were playing there at ball yesterday evening continued the boy addressing himself to mr somerville and one of the lads challenged me to hit a mark in the wall which i did but he said i did not hit it and bade me give him up my ball as the forfeit this i would not do and when he began to wrestle with me for it i threw the ball as i thought over the house he ran to look for it in the street but could not find it which i was very glad of but i was very sorry just now to find it myself lying upon this heap of shavings sir under this broken window for as soon as i saw it lying there i knew i must have been the person that broke the window and through this window came the white pigeon here's one of his white feathers sticking in the gap yes said the carpenter and in the bow-window room below there's plenty of his feathers to be seen for i've just been down to look it was the pigeon broke them windows sure enough but he could not have got in had i not broke this little window said the boy eagerly and i am able to earn sixpence a day and i'll pay for all the mischief and welcome the white pigeon belongs to a poor neighbour a friend of ours who is very fond of him and i would not have him killed for twice as much money take the pigeon my honest generous lad said mr somerville and carry him back to your neighbour i forgive him all the mischief he has done me tell your friend for your sake as to the rest we can have the windows mended and do you keep all the sixpences you earn for yourself that's what he never did yet said the carpenter many's the sixpence he earns but not a halfpenny goes into his own pocket it goes every farthing to his poor father and mother happy for them to have such a son more happy for him to have such a father and mother exclaimed the boy their good days they took all the best care of me that was to be had for love or money and would if i would let them go on paying for my schooling now falling as they be in the world but i must learn to mind the shop now good morning to you sir and thank you kindly said he to mr somerville and where does this boy live and who are his father and mother they cannot live in town said mr somerville or i should have heard of them they are but just come into the town please your honour said the carpenter they lived formerly upon counsellor o'donnel's estate but they were ruined please your honour by taking a joint lease with a man who fell afterwards into bad company ran out all he had so could not pay the landlord and these poor people were forced to pay his share and their own too which almost ruined them they were obliged to give up the land and now they have furnished a little shop in this town with what goods they could afford to buy with the money they got by the sale of their cattle and stock they have the good-will of all who know them and i am sure i hope they will do well the boy is very ready in the shop though he said only that he could earn sixpence a day he writes a good hand and is quick at casting up accounts for his age besides he is likely to do well in the world because he is never in idle company and i've known him since he was two foot high and never heard of his telling a lie this is an excellent character of the boy indeed said mr somerville and from his behaviour this morning i am inclined to think that he deserves all your praises mr somerville resolved to inquire more fully concerning this poor family and to attend to their conduct himself fully determined to assist them if he should find them such as they had been represented in the meantime this boy whose name was brian o'neill went to return the white pigeon to its owner you have saved its life said the woman to whom it belonged and i'll make you a present of it brian thanked her and he from that day began to grow fond of the pigeon he always took care to scatter some oats for it in his father's yard and the pigeon grew so tame at last that it would hop about the kitchen and eat off the same trencher with the dog brian after the shop was shut up at night used to amuse himself with reading some little books which the schoolmaster who formerly taught him arithmetic was so good as to lend him amongst these he one evening met with a little book full of the history of birds and beasts he looked immediately to see whether the pigeon was mentioned amongst the birds and to his great joy he found a full description and history of his favourite bird so brian i see your schooling has not been thrown away upon you you like your book i see when you have no master over you to bid you read said his father when he came in and saw brian reading his book very attentively thank you for having me taught to read father said brian here i've made a great discovery i've found out in this book little as it looks father a most curious way of making a fortune and i hope it will make your fortune father and if you'll sit down i'll tell it to you mr o'neill in hopes of pleasing his son rather than in the expectation of having his fortune made immediately sat down to listen and his son explained to him that he had found in his book an account of pigeons who carried notes and letters and father continued brian i find my pigeon is of this sort and i intend to make my pigeon carry messages why should not he if other pigeons have done so before him i think he is as good and i daresay will be as easy to teach as any pigeon in the world i shall begin to teach him to-morrow morning and then father you know people often pay a great deal for sending messengers and no boy can run no horse can gallop so fast as a bird can fly therefore the bird must be the best messenger and i should be paid the best price hey father to be sure to be sure my boy said his father laughing i wish you may make the best messenger in ireland of your pigeon but all i beg my dear boy is that you won't neglect our shop for your pigeon for i've a notion we have a better chance of making a fortune by the shop than by the white pigeon brian never neglected the shop but in his leisure hours he amused himself with training his pigeon and after much patience he at last succeeded so well that one day he went to his father and offered to send him word by his pigeon what beef was a pound in the market of ballynagrish where he was going the pigeon will be home long before me father and he will come in at the kitchen window and light upon the dresser then you must untie the little note which i shall have tied under his left wing and you'll know the price of beef directly the pigeon carried his message well and brian was much delighted with his success he soon was employed by the neighbours who were aroused by brian's fondness of his swift messenger and soon the fame of the white pigeon was spread amongst all who frequented the markets and fairs of somerville at one of these fairs a set of men of desperate fortunes met to drink and to concert plans of robberies their place of meeting was at the ale-house of mr cox the man who as our readers may remember was offended by mr somerville's hinting that he was fond of drinking and of quarrelling and who threatened vengeance for having been refused the new inn whilst these men were talking over their scheme one of them observed that one of their companions was not arrived another said no he's six miles off said another and a third wished that he could make him hear at that distance this turned the discourse upon the difficulties of sending messages secretly and quickly cox's son a lad of about nineteen who was one of this gang mentioned the white carrier-pigeon and he was desired to try all means to get it into his possession accordingly the next day young cox went to brian o'neill and tried at first by persuasion and afterwards by threats to prevail upon him to give up the pigeon brian was resolute in his refusal more especially when the petitioner began to bully him if we can't have it by fair means we will by foul said cox and a few days afterwards the pigeon was gone brian searched for it in vain -- inquired from all the neighbours if they had seen it and applied but to no purpose to cox he swore that he knew nothing about the matter but this was false for it was he who during the night-time had stolen the white pigeon he conveyed it to his employers and they rejoiced that they had gotten it into their possession as they thought it would serve them for a useful messenger nothing can be more shortsighted than cunning the very means which these people took to secure secrecy were the means of bringing their plots to light they endeavoured to teach the pigeon which they had stolen to carry messages for them in a part of the country at some distance from somerville and when they fancied that it had forgotten its former habits and its old master they thought that they might venture to employ him nearer home the pigeon however had a better memory than they imagined they loosed him from a bag near the town of ballynagrish in hopes that he would stop at the house of cox's cousin which was on its road between ballynagrish and somerville but the pigeon though he had been purposely fed at this house for a week before this trial did not stop there but flew on to his old master's house in somerville and pecked at the kitchen window as he had formerly been taught to do his father fortunately was within hearing and poor brian ran with the greatest joy to open the window and to let him in o father here's my white pigeon come back of his own accord exclaimed brian i must run and show him to my mother at this instant the pigeon spread his wings and brian discovered under one of its wings a small and very dirty looking billet he opened it in his father's presence the scrawl was scarcely legible but these words were at length deciphered -- thare are eight of uz sworn i send yo at botom thare names we meat at tin this nite at my faders and have harms and all in radiness to brak into the grate 'ouse mr summervill is to lye out to nite -- kip the pigeon untill to-morrow for ever yours murtagh cox jun scarcely had they finished reading this note than both father and son exclaimed let us go and show it to mr somerville before they set out they had however the prudence to secure the pigeon so that he should not be seen by anyone but themselves mr somerville in consequence of this fortunate discovery took proper measures for the apprehension of the eight men who had sworn to rob his house when they were all safely lodged in the county gaol he sent for brian o'neill and his father and after thanking them for the service they had done him he counted out ten bright guineas upon a table and pushed them towards brian saying i suppose you know that a reward of ten guineas was offered some weeks ago for the discovery of john mac dermod one of the eight men whom we have just taken up no sir said brian i did not know it and i did not bring that note to you to get ten guineas but because i thought it was right i don't want to be paid for doing it that's my own boy said his father we thank you sir but we'll not take the money i don't like to take the price of blood i know the difference my good friends said mr somerville between vile informers and courageous honest men why as to that please your honour though we are poor i hope we are honest and what is more said mr somerville i have a notion that you would continue to be honest even if you were rich will you my good lad continued mr somerville after a moment's pause -- will you trust me with your pigeon a few days o and welcome sir said the boy with a smile and he brought the pigeon to mr somerville when it was dark and nobody saw him a few days afterwards mr somerville called at o'neill's house and bid him and his son follow him they followed till he stopped opposite to the bow-window of the new inn the carpenter had just put up a sign which was covered over with a bit of carpeting go up the ladder will you said mr somerville to brian and pull that sign straight for it hangs quite crooked there now it is straight now pull off the carpet and let us see the new sign the boy pulled off the cover and saw a white pigeon painted upon the sign and the name of o'neill in large letters underneath take care you do not tumble down and break your neck upon this joyful occasion said mr somerville who saw that brian's surprise was too great for his situation come down from the ladder and wish your father joy of being master of the new inn called the 'white pigeon ' and i wish him joy of having such a son as you are those who bring up their children well will certainly be rewarded for it be they poor or rich the birthday present mamma said rosamond after a long silence do you know what i have been thinking of all this time no my dear -- what why mamma about my cousin bell's birthday do you know what day it is no i don't remember dear mother don't you remember it's the 22nd of december and her birthday is the day after to-morrow don't you recollect now but you never remember about birthdays mamma that was just what i was thinking of that you never remember my sister laura's birthday or-or-or mine mamma what do you mean my dear i remember your birthday perfectly well indeed but you never keep it though what do you mean by keeping your birthday oh mamma you know very well -- as bell's birthday is kept in the first place there is a great dinner and can bell eat more upon her birthday than upon any other day no nor i should not mind about the dinner except the mince-pies but bell has a great many nice things -- i don't mean nice eatable things but nice new playthings given to her always on her birthday and everybody drinks her health and she's so happy but stay rosamond how you jumble things together is it everybody's drinking her health that makes her so happy or the new playthings or the nice mince pies i can easily believe that she is happy whilst she is eating a mince pie or whilst she is playing but how does everybody's drinking her health at dinner make her happy rosamond paused and then said she did not know but added she the nice new playthings mother but why the nice new playthings do you like them only because they are new not only -- i do not like playthings only because they are new but bell does i believe -- for that puts me in mind -- do you know mother she had a great drawer full of old playthings that she never used and she said that they were good for nothing because they were old but i thought many of them were good for a great deal more than the new ones now you shall be judge mamma i'll tell you all that was in the drawer nay rosamond thank you not just now i have not time to listen to you well then mamma the day after to-morrow i can show you the drawer i want you to judge very much because i am sure i was in the right and mother added rosamond stopping her as she was going out of the room will you -- not now but when you've time -- will you tell me why you never keep my birthday -- why you never make any difference between that day and any other day and will you rosamond -- not now but when you have time to think about it -- tell me why i should make any difference between your birthday and any other day rosamond thought but she could not find out any reason besides she suddenly recollected that she had not time to think any longer for there was a certain work-basket to be finished which she was making for her cousin bell as a present upon her birthday the work was at a stand for want of some filigree-paper and as her mother was going out she asked her to take her with her that she might buy some her sister laura went with them sister said rosamond as they were walking along what have you done with your half-guinea i have it in my pocket dear you will keep it for ever in your pocket you know my godmother when she gave it to you said you would keep it longer than i should keep mine and i know what she thought by her look at the time i heard her say something to my mother yes said laura smiling she whispered so loud that i could not help hearing her too she said i was a little miser but did not you hear her say that i was very generous and she'll see that she was not mistaken i hope she'll be by when i give my basket to bell -- won't it be beautiful there is to be a wreath of myrtle you know round the handle and a frost ground and then the medallions -- stay interrupted her sister for rosamond anticipating the glories of her work-basket talked and walked so fast that she had passed without perceiving it the shop where the filigree-paper was to be bought they turned back now it happened that the shop was the corner house of a street and one of the windows looked out into a narrow lane a coach full of ladies stopped at the door just before they went in so that no one had time immediately to think of rosamond and her filigree-paper and she went to the window where she saw her sister laura looking earnestly at something that was passing in the lane opposite to the window at the door of a poor-looking house there was sitting a little girl weaving lace her bobbins moved as quick as lightning and she never once looked up from her work is not she very industrious said laura and very honest too added she in a minute afterwards for just then a baker with a basket of rolls on his head passed and by accident one of the rolls fell close to the little girl she took it up eagerly looked at it as if she was very hungry then put aside her work and ran after the baker to return it to him whilst she was gone a footman in a livery laced with silver who belonged to the coach that stood at the shop door as he was lounging with one of his companions chanced to spy the weaving pillow which she had left upon a stone before the door to divert himself for idle people do mischief often to divert themselves he took up the pillow and entangled all the bobbins the little girl came back out of breath to her work but what was her surprise and sorrow to find it spoiled she twisted and untwisted placed and replaced the bobbins while the footman stood laughing at her distress she got up gently and was retiring into the house when the silver laced footman stopped her saying insolently sit still child i must go to my mother sir said the child besides you have spoiled all my lace i can't stay can't you said the brutal footman snatching her weaving-pillow again i'll teach you to complain of me and he broke off one after another all the bobbins put them into his pocket rolled her weaving-pillow down the dirty lane then jumped up behind his mistress' coach and was out of sight in an instant poor girl exclaimed rosamond no longer able to restrain her indignation at this injustice poor little girl at this instant her mother said to rosamond -- come now my dear if you want this filigree paper buy it yes madam said rosamond and the idea of what her godmother and her cousin bell would think of her generosity rushed again upon her imagination all her feelings of pity were immediately suppressed satisfied with bestowing another exclamation upon the poor little girl she went to spend her half-guinea upon her filigree basket in the meantime she that was called the little miser beckoned to the poor girl and opening the window said pointing to the cushion is it quite spoiled quite quite spoiled and i can't nor mother neither buy another and i can't do anything else for my bread a few but very few tears fell as she said this how much would another cost said laura oh a great -- great deal more than that said laura holding up her half-guinea oh no then you can buy another with that said laura dropping the half- guinea into her hand and she shut the window before the child could find words to thank her but not before she saw a look of joy and gratitude which gave laura more pleasure probably than all the praise which could have been bestowed upon her generosity late on the morning of her cousin's birthday rosamond finished her work- basket the carriage was at the door -- laura came running to call her her father's voice was heard at the same instant so she was obliged to go down with her basket but half wrapped up in silver paper -- a circumstance at which she was a good deal disconcerted for the pleasure of surprising bell would be utterly lost if one bit of the filigree should peep out before the proper time as the carriage went on rosamond pulled the paper to one side and to the other and by each of the four corners it will never do my dear said her father who had been watching her operations i am afraid you will never make a sheet of paper cover a box which is twice as large as itself it is not a box father said rosamond a little peevishly it's a basket let us look at this basket said he taking it out of her unwilling hands for she knew of what frail materials it was made and she dreaded its coming to pieces under her father's examination he took hold of the handle rather roughly when starting off the coach seat she cried oh sir father sir you will spoil it indeed said she with increased vehemence when after drawing aside the veil of silver paper she saw him grasp the myrtle wreathed handle indeed sir you will spoil the poor handle but what is the use of the poor handle said her father if we are not to take hold of it and pray continued he turning the basket round with his finger and thumb rather in a disrespectful manner pray is this the thing you have been about all this week i have seen you all this week dabbling with paste and rags i could not conceive what you were about is this the thing yes sir you think then that i have wasted my time because the basket is of no use but then it is a present for my cousin bell your cousin bell will be very much obliged to you for a present that is of no use you had better have given her the purple jar oh father i thought you had forgotten that -- it was two years ago i'm not so silly now but bell will like the basket i know though it is of no use then you think bell is sillier now than you were two years ago -- well perhaps that is true but how comes it rosamond now that you are so wise that you are fond of such a silly person i father said rosamond hesitating i don't think i am very fond of her i did not say very fond well but i don't think i am at all fond of her but you have spent a whole week in making this thing for her yes and all my half guinea besides yet you think her silly and you are not fond of her at all and you say you know this thing will be of no use to her but it is her birthday sir and i am sure she will expect something and everybody else will give her something then your reason for giving is because she expects you to give her something and will you or can you or should you always give merely because others expect or because somebody else gives always -- no not always oh only on birthdays rosamond laughing now you are making a joke of me papa i see but i thought you liked that people should be generous -- my godmother said that she did so do i full as well as your godmother but we have not yet quite settled what it is to be generous why is it not generous to make presents said rosamond that is the question which it would take up a great deal of time to answer but for instance to make a present of a thing that you know can be of no use to a person you neither love nor esteem because it is her birthday and because everybody gives her something and because she expects something and because your godmother says she likes that people should be generous seems to me my dear rosamond to be since i must say it rather more like folly than generosity rosamond looked down upon the basket and was silent then i am a fool am i said she looking up at last because you have made one mistake no if you have sense enough to see your own mistakes and can afterwards avoid them you will never be a fool here the carriage stopped and rosamond recollected that the basket was uncovered now we must observe that rosamond's father had not been too severe upon bell when he called her a silly girl from her infancy she had been humoured and at eight years old she had the misfortune to be a spoiled child she was idle fretful and selfish so that nothing could make her happy on her birthday she expected however to be perfectly happy everybody in the house tried to please her and they succeeded so well that between breakfast and dinner she had only six fits of crying the cause of five of these fits no one could discover but the last and most lamentable was occasioned by a disappointment about a worked muslin frock and accordingly at dressing time her maid brought it to her exclaiming see here miss what your mamma has sent you on your birthday here's a frock fit for a queen -- if it had but lace round the cuffs and why has not it lace around the cuffs mamma said it should yes but mistress was disappointed about the lace it is not come home not come home indeed and didn't they know it was my birthday but then i say i won't wear it without the lace -- i can't wear it without the lace and i won't the lace however could not be had and bell at length submitted to let the frock be put on come miss bell dry your eyes said the maid who educated her dry your eyes and i'll tell you something that will please you what then said the child pouting and sobbing why -- but you must not tell that i told you no -- but if i am asked why if you are asked you must tell the truth to be sure so i'll hold my tongue miss nay tell me though and i'll never tell -- if i am asked well then said the maid your cousin rosamond is come and has brought you the most beautifullest thing you ever saw in your life but you are not to know anything about it till after dinner because she wants to surprise you and mistress has put it into her wardrobe till after dinner till after dinner repeated bell impatiently i can't wait till then i must see it this minute the maid refused her several times till bell burst into another fit of crying and the maid fearing that her mistress would be angry with her if bell's eyes were red at dinner time consented to show her the basket how pretty -- but let me have it in my own hands said bell as the maid held the basket up out of her reach oh no you must not touch it for if you should spoil it what would become of me become of you indeed exclaimed the spoiled child who never considered anything but her own immediate gratification -- become of you indeed what signifies that -- i sha'n't spoil it and i will have it in my own hands if you don't hold it down for me directly i'll tell that you showed it to me then you won't snatch it no no i won't indeed said bell but she had learned from her maid a total disregard of truth she snatched the basket the moment it was within her reach a struggle ensued in which the handle and lid were torn off and one of the medallions crushed inwards before the little fury returned to her senses calmed at this sight the next question was how she should conceal the mischief which she had done after many attempts the handle and lid were replaced the basket was put exactly in the same spot in which it had stood before and the maid charged the child to look as if nothing was the matter we hope that both children and parents will here pause for a moment to reflect the habits of tyranny meanness and falsehood which children acquire from living with bad servants are scarcely ever conquered in the whole course of their future lives after shutting up the basket they left the room and in the adjoining passage they found a poor girl waiting with a small parcel in her hand what's your business said the maid i have brought home the lace madam that was bespoke for the young lady oh you have have you at last said bell and pray why didn't you bring it sooner the girl was going to answer but the maid interrupted her saying -- come come none of your excuses you are a little idle good-for-nothing thing to disappoint miss bell upon her birthday but now you have brought it let us look at it the little girl gave the lace without reply and the maid desired her to go about her business and not to expect to be paid for that her mistress could not see anybody because she was in a room full of company may i call again madam this afternoon said the child timidly lord bless my stars replied the maid what makes people so poor i wonders i wish mistress would buy her lace at the warehouse as i told her and not of these folks call again yes to be sure i believe you'd call call call twenty times for twopence however ungraciously the permission to call again was granted it was received with gratitude the little girl departed with a cheerful countenance and bell teazed her maid till she got her to sew the long wished-for lace upon her cuffs unfortunate bell -- all dinner time passed and people were so hungry so busy or so stupid that not an eye observed her favourite piece of finery till at length she was no longer able to conceal her impatience and turning to laura who sat next to her she said you have no lace upon your cuffs look how beautiful mine is -- is not it don't you wish your mamma could afford to give some like it but you can't get any if she would for this was made on purpose for me on my birthday and nobody can get a bit more anywhere if they would give the world for it but cannot the person who made it said laura make any more like it no no no cried bell for she had already learned either from her maid or her mother the mean pride which values things not for being really pretty or useful but for being such as nobody else can procure nobody can get any like it i say repeated bell nobody in all london can make it but one person and that person will never make a bit for anybody but me i am sure mamma won't let her if i ask her not very well said laura coolly i do not want any of it you need not be so violent i assure you that i don't want any of it yes but you do though said bell more angrily no indeed said laura smiling you do in the bottom of your heart but you say you don't to plague me i know cried bell swelling with disappointed vanity it is pretty for all that and it cost a great deal of money too and nobody shall have any like it if they cried their eyes out laura received this declaration in silence -- rosamond smiled and at her smile the ill-suppressed rage of the spoiled child burst forth into the seventh and loudest fit of crying which had yet been heard on her birthday what's the matter my pet cried her mother come to me and tell me what's the matter bell ran roaring to her mother but no otherwise explained the cause of her sorrow than by tearing the fine lace with frantic gestures from her cuffs and throwing the fragments into her mother's lap oh the lace child -- are you mad said her mother catching hold of both her hands your beautiful lace my dear love -- do you know how much it cost i don't care how much it cost -- it is not beautiful and i'll have none of it replied bell sobbing for it is not beautiful but it is beautiful retorted her mother i chose the pattern myself who has put it into your head child to dislike it was it nancy no not nancy but them mamma said bell pointing to laura and rosamond oh fie don't point said her mother putting down her stubborn finger nor say them like nancy i am sure you misunderstood miss laura i am sure did not mean any such thing no madam and i did not say any such thing that i recollect said laura gently oh no indeed cried rosamond warmly rising in her sister's defence no defence or explanation however was to be heard for everybody had now gathered round bell to dry her tears and to comfort her for the mischief she had done to her own cuffs they succeeded so well that in about a quarter of an hour the young lady's eyes and the reddened arches over her eyebrows came to their natural colour and the business being thus happily hushed up the mother as a reward to her daughter for her good humour begged that rosamond would now be so good as to produce her charming present rosamond followed by all the company amongst whom to her great joy was her godmother proceeded to the dressing room now i am sure thought she bell will be surprised and my godmother will see she was right about my generosity the doors of the wardrobe were opened with due ceremony and the filigree basket appeared in all its glory well this is a charming present indeed said the godmother who was one of the company my rosamond knows how to make presents and as she spoke she took hold of the basket to lift it down to the admiring audience scarcely had she touched it when lo the basket fell to the ground and only the handle remained in her hand all eyes were fixed upon the wreck exclamations of sorrow were heard in various tones and who can have done this was all that rosamond could say bell stood in sullen silence which she obstinately preserved in the midst of the inquiries that were made about the disaster at length the servants were summoned and amongst them nancy miss bell's maid and governess she affected much surprise when she saw what had befallen the basket and declared that she knew nothing of the matter but that she had seen her mistress in the morning put it quite safe into the wardrobe and that for her part she had never touched it or thought of touching it in her born days nor miss bell neither ma'am -- i can answer for her for she never knew of its being there because i never so much as mentioned it to her that there was such a thing in the house because i knew miss rosamond wanted to surprise her with the secret so i never mentioned a sentence of it -- did i miss bell bell putting on the deceitful look which her maid had taught her answered boldly no but she had hold of rosamond's hand and at the instant she uttered this falsehood she squeezed it terribly why do you squeeze my hand so said rosamond in a low voice what are you afraid of afraid of cried bell turning angrily i'm not afraid of anything -- i've nothing to be afraid about nay i did not say you had whispered rosamond but only if you did by accident -- you know what i mean -- i should not be angry if you did -- only say so i say i did not cried bell furiously mamma mamma nancy my cousin rosamond won't believe me that's very hard it's very rude and i won't bear it -- i won't don't be angry love don't said the maid nobody suspects you darling said her mother but she has too much sensibility don't cry love nobody suspected you but you know continued she turning to the maid somebody must have done this and i must know how it was done miss rosamond's charming present must not be spoiled in this way in my house without my taking proper notice of it i assure you i am very angry about it rosamond rosamond did not rejoice in her anger and had nearly made a sad mistake by speaking aloud her thoughts -- i was very foolish -- she began and stopped ma'am cried the maid suddenly i'll venture to say i know who did it who said everyone eagerly who said bell trembling why miss don't you recollect that little girl with the lace that we saw peeping about in the passage i'm sure she must have done it for here she was by herself half an hour or more and not another creature has been in mistress' dressing-room to my certain knowledge since morning those sort of people have so much curiosity i'm sure she must have been meddling with it added the maid oh yes that's the thing said the mistress decidedly well miss rosamond for your comfort she shall never come into my house again oh that would not comfort me at all said rosamond besides we are not sure that she did it and if -- a single knock at the door was heard at this instant it was the little girl who came to be paid for her lace call her in said the lady of the house let us see her directly the maid who was afraid that the girl's innocence would appear if she were produced hesitated but upon her mistress repeating her commands she was forced to obey the girl came in with a look of simplicity but when she saw a room full of company she was a little abashed rosamond and laura looked at her and one another with surprise for it was the same little girl whom they had seen weaving lace is not it she whispered rosamond to her sister yes it is but hush said laura she does not know us don't say a word let us hear what she will say laura got behind the rest of the company as she spoke so that the little girl could not see her vastly well said bell's mother i am waiting to see how long you will have the assurance to stand there with that innocent look did you ever see that basket before yes ma'am said the girl yes ma'am cried the maid and what else do you know about it you had better confess it at once and mistress perhaps will say no more about it yes do confess it added bell earnestly confess what madam said the little girl i never touched the basket madam you never touched it but you confess interrupted bell's mother that you did see it before and pray how came you to see it you must have opened my wardrobe no indeed ma'am said the little girl but i was waiting in the passage ma'am and this door was partly open and looking at the maid you know i could not help seeing it why how could you see through the doors of my wardrobe rejoined the lady the maid frightened pulled the little girl by the sleeve answer me said the lady where did you see this basket another stronger pull i saw it madam in her hands looking at the maid and -- well and what became of it afterwards ma'am -- hesitating -- miss pulled and by accident -- i believe i saw ma'am -- miss you know what i saw i do not know -- i do not know and if i did you had no business there and mamma won't believe you i am sure everybody else however did believe and their eyes were fixed upon bell in a manner which made her feel rather ashamed what do you all look at me so for why do you all look so and am i to be put to shame on my birthday cried she bursting into a roar of passion and all for this nasty thing added she pushing away the remains of the basket and looking angrily at rosamond bell bell o fie fie -- now i am ashamed of you that's quite rude to your cousin said her mother who was more shocked at her daughter's want of politeness than at her falsehood take her away nancy till she has done crying added she to the maid who accordingly carried off her pupil rosamond during this scene especially at the moment when her present was pushed away with such disdain had been making reflections upon the nature of true generosity a smile from her father who stood by a silent spectator of the catastrophe of the filigree basket gave rise to these reflections nor were they entirely dissipated by the condolence of the rest of the company nor even by the praises of her godmother who for the purpose of condoling with her said well my dear rosamond i admire your generous spirit you know i prophesied that your half-guinea would be gone the soonest did i not laura said she appealing in a sarcastic tone to where she thought laura was where is laura i don't see her laura came forward you are too prudent to throw away your money like your sister your half-guinea i'll answer for it is snug in your pocket -- is it not no madam answered she in a low voice but low as the voice of laura was the poor little lace-girl heard it and now for the first time fixing her eyes upon laura recollected her benefactress oh that's the young lady she exclaimed in a tone of joyful gratitude the good good young lady who gave me the half- guinea and would not stay to be thanked for it but i will thank her now the half-guinea laura said her godmother what is all this i'll tell you madam if you please said the little girl it was not in expectation of being praised for it that laura had been generous and therefore everybody was really touched with the history of the weaving-pillow and whilst they praised felt a certain degree of respect which is not always felt by those who pour forth eulogiums respect is not an improper word even applied to a child of laura's age for let the age or situation of the person be what it may they command respect who deserve it ah madam said rosamond to her godmother now you see -- you see she is not a little miser i'm sure that's better than wasting half a guinea upon a filigree basket is it not ma'am said she with an eagerness which showed that she had forgotten all her own misfortunes in sympathy with her sister this is being really generous father is it not yes rosamond said her father and he kissed her this is being really generous it is not only by giving away money that we can show generosity it is by giving up to others anything that we like ourselves and therefore added he smiling it is really generous of you to give your sister the thing you like best of all others the thing i like the best of all others father said rosamond half pleased half vexed what is that i wonder you don't mean praise do you sir nay you must decide that yourself rosamond why sir said she ingenuously perhaps it was once the thing i liked best but the pleasure i have just felt makes me like something else much better eton montem extracted from the courier of may 1799 yesterday this triennial ceremony took place with which the public are too well acquainted to require a particular description a collection called salt is taken from the public which forms a purse to support the captain of the school in his studies at cambridge this collection is made by the scholars dressed in fancy dresses all round the country at eleven o'clock the youths being assembled in their habiliments at the college the royal family set off from the castle to see them and after walking round the courtyard they proceeded to salt hill in the following order -- his majesty his royal highness the prince of wales and the earl of uxbridge their royal highnesses the dukes of kent and cumberland earl morton and general gwynne all on horseback dressed in the windsor uniform except the prince of wales who wore a suit of dark blue and a brown surtout over then followed the scholars preceded by the marechal serjeant the musicians of the staffordshire band and mr ford captain of the seminary the serjeant major serjeants colonels corporals musicians ensign lieutenant steward salt bearers polemen and runners the cavalcade was brought up by her majesty and her amiable daughters in two carriages and a numerous company of equestrians and pedestrians all eager to behold their sovereign and his family among the former lady lade was foremost in the throng only two others dared venture their persons on horseback in such a multitude the king and royal family were stopped on eton bridge by messrs young and mansfield the salt bearers to whom their majesties delivered their customary donation of fifty guineas each at salt hill his majesty with his usual affability took upon himself to arrange the procession round the royal carriages and even when the horses were taken off with the assistance of the duke of kent fastened the traces round the pole of the coaches to prevent any inconvenience an exceeding heavy shower of rain coming on the prince took leave and went to the 'windmill inn ' till it subsided the king and his attendants weathered it out in their great-coats after the young gentlemen walked round the carriage ensign vince and the salt bearers proceeded to the summit of the hill but the wind being boisterous he could not exhibit his dexterity in displaying his flag and the space being too small before the carriages from the concourse of spectators the king kindly acquiesced in not having it displayed under such inconvenience their majesties and the princesses then returned home the king occasionally stopping to converse with the dean of windsor the earl of harrington and other noblemen the scholars partook of an elegant dinner at the 'windmill inn ' and in the evening walked on windsor terrace their royal highnesses the prince of wales and duke of cumberland after taking leave of their majesties set off for town and honoured the opera house with their presence in the evening the profit arising from the salt collected according to account amounted to 8oo pounds the stadtholder the duke of gordon lord and lady melbourne viscount brome and a numerous train of fashionable nobility were present the following is an account of their dresses made as usual very handsomely by mrs snow milliner of windsor -- mr ford captain with eight gentlemen to attend him as servitors mr sarjeant marechal mr bradith colonel mr plumtree lieutenant mr vince ensign mr young college salt bearer white and gold dress rich satin bag covered with gold netting mr mansfield oppidan white purple and orange dress trimmed with silver rich satin bag purple and silver each carrying elegant poles with gold and silver cord mr keity yellow and black velvet helmet trimmed with silver mr bartelot plain mantle and sandals scotch bonnet a very douglas mr knapp flesh-colour and blue

mr drury mazarin blue fancy cap mr davis slate-colour and straw mr routh pink and silver spanish hat mr curtis purple fancy cap mr lloyd blue ditto at the conclusion of the ceremony the royal family returned to windsor and the boys were all sumptuously entertained at the tavern at salt hill about six in the evening all the boys returned in the order of procession and marching round the great square of eton were dismissed the captain then paid his respects to the royal family at the queen's lodge windsor previously to his departure for king's college cambridge to defray which expense the produce of the montem was presented to him the day concluded by a brilliant promenade of beauty rank and fashion on windsor terrace enlivened by the performance of several bands of music the origin of the procession is from the custom by which the manor was held the custom of hunting the ram belonged to eton college as well as the custom of salt but it was discontinued by dr cook late dean of ely now this custom we know to have been entered on the register of the royal abbey of bec in normandy as one belonging to the manor of east or great wrotham in norfolk given by ralph de toni to the abbey of bec and was as follows -- when the harvest was finished the tenants were to have half an acre of barley and a ram let loose and if they caught him he was their own to make merry with but if he escaped from them he was the lord's the etonians in order to secure the ram houghed him in the irish fashion and then attacked him with great clubs the cruelty of this proceeding brought it into disuse and now it exists no longer -- see register of the royal abbey of bec folio 58 after the dissolution of the alien priories in 1414 by the parliament of leicester they remained in the crown till henry vi who gave wrotham manor to eton college and if the eton fellows would search they would perhaps find the manor in their possession that was held by the custom of salt men alderman bursal father of young bursal lord john talbot wheeler young gentlemen of eton from 17 to 19 years of age bursal rory o'ryan mr newington landlord of the inn at salt hill farmer hearty a waiter and crowd of eton lads women the marchioness of piercefield mother of lord john lady violetta -- her daughter a child of six or seven years old mrs talbot lousia talbot her daughter miss bursal daughter to the alderman mrs newington landlady of the inn at salt hill sally a chambermaid patty a country girl pipe and tabor and dance of peasants scene i the bar of the windmill inn at salt hill mr and mrs newington the landlord and landlady landlady 'tis an unpossibility mr newington and that's enough say no more about it 'tis an unpossibility in the natur of things she ranges jellies etc in the bar and pray do you take your great old fashioned tankard mr newington from among my jellies and confectioneries landlord takes his tankard and drinks anything for a quiet life if it is an impossibility i've no more to say only for the soul of me i can't see the great unpossibility wife landlady wife indeed -- wife -- wife wife every minute landlord heyday why what a plague would you have me call you the other day you quarrelled with me for calling you mrs landlady landlady to be sure i did and very proper in me i should i've turned off three waiters and five chambermaids already for screaming after me mrs landlady mrs landlady but 'tis all your ill manners landlord ill manners why if i may be so bold if you are not mrs landlady in the name of wonder what are you landlady mrs newington mr newington landlord drinks mrs newington mr newington drinks your health for i suppose i must not be landlord any more in my own house shrugs landlady oh as to that i have no objections nor impediments to your being called landlord you look it and become it very proper landlord why yes indeed thank my tankard i do look it and become it and am nowise ashamed of it but everyone to their mind as you wife don't fancy the being called mrs landlady landlady to be sure i don't why when folks hear the old fashioned cry of mrs landlady mrs landlady who do they expect think you to see but an overgrown fat featherbed of a woman coming waddling along with her thumbs sticking on each side of her apron o' this fashion now to see me coming nobody would take me to be a landlady landlord very true indeed wife -- mrs newington i mean -- i ask pardon but now to go on with what we were saying about the unpossibility of letting that old lady and the civil-spoken young lady there above have them there rooms for another day landlady now mr newington let me hear no more about that old gentlewoman and that civil-spoken young lady fair words cost nothing and i've a notion that's the cause they are so plenty with the young lady neither o' them i take it by what they've ordered since their coming into the house are such grand folk that one need be so petticular about them landlord why they came only in a chaise and pair to be sure i can't deny that landlady but bless my stars what signifies talking don't you know as well as i do mr newington that to-morrow is eton montem and that if we had twenty times as many rooms and as many more to the back of them it would not be one too many for all the company we've a right to expect and those the highest quality of the land nay what do i talk of to-morrow isn't my lady piercefield and suite expected and moreover mr and miss bursal's to be here and will call for as much in an hour as your civil-spoken young lady in a twelvemonth i reckon so mr newington if you don't think proper to go up and inform the ladies above that the dolphin rooms are not for them i must speak myself though 'tis a thing i never do when i can help it landlord aside she not like to speak aloud my dear you can speak a power better than i can so take it all upon yourself if you please for old-fashioned as i and my tankard here be i can't make a speech that borders on the uncivil order to a lady like for the life and lungs of me so in the name of goodness do you go up mrs newington landlady and so i will mr newington help ye civilities and rarities are out o' season for them that can't pay for them in this world and very proper exit landlady landlord and very proper ha who comes yonder the eton chap who wheedled me into lending him my best hunter last year and was the ruination of him but that must be paid for wheedle or no wheedle and for the matter of wheedling i'd stake this here mr wheeler that is making up to me do you see against e'er a boy or hobbledehoy in all eton london or christendom let the other be who he will enter wheeler wheeler a fine day mr newington landlord a fine day mr wheeler wheel and i hope for your sake we may have as fine a day for the montem to-morrow it will be a pretty penny in your pocket why all the world will be here and looking round at the jellies etc so much the better for them for here are good things enough and enough for them and here's the best thing of all the good old tankard still not empty i hope landlord not empty i hope here's to you mr wheeler wheel mr wheeler -- captain wheeler if you please landlord you captain wheeler why i thought in former times it was always the oldest scholar at eton that was captain at the montems and didn't mr talbot come afore you wheel not at all we came on the same day some say i came first some say talbot so the choice of which of us is to be captain is to be put to the vote amongst the lads -- most votes carry it and i have most votes i fancy so i shall be captain to-morrow and a pretty deal of salt i reckon i shall pocket why the collection at the last montem they say came to a plump thousand no bad thing for a young fellow to set out with for oxford or cambridge -- hey salt the cant name given by the eton lads to the money collected at montem landlord and no bad thing before he sets out for cambridge or oxford 'twould be for a young gentleman to pay his debts wheel debts oh time enough for that i've a little account with you in horses i know but that's between you and me you know -- mum landlord mum me no mums mr wheeler between you and me my best hunter has been ruinationed and i can't afford to be mum so you'll take no offence if i speak and as you'll set off to-morrow as soon as the montem's over you'll be pleased to settle with me some way or other to-day as we've no other time wheel no time so proper certainly where's the little account -- i have money sent me for my montem dress and i can squeeze that much out of it i came home from eton on purpose to settle with you but as to the hunter you must call upon talbot -- do you understand to pay for him for though talbot and i had him the same day 'twas talbot did for him and talbot must pay i spoke to him about it and charged him to remember you for i never forget to speak a good word for my friends landlord so i perceive wheel i'll make bold just to give you my opinion of these jellies whilst you are getting my account mr newington he swallows down a jelly or two -- landlord is going enter talbot talbot hallo landlord where are making off so fast here your jellies are all going as fast as yourself wheel aside talbot -- i wish i was a hundred miles off landlord you are heartily welcome mr talbot a good morning to you sir i'm glad to see you -- very glad to see you mr talbot talb then shake hands my honest landlord talbot in shaking hands with him puts a purse into the landlord's hands landlord what's here guineas talb the hunter you know since wheeler won't pay i must -- that's all good morning wheel aside what a fool landlord as talbot is going catches hold of his coat landlord hold mr talbot this won't do talb won't it well then my watch must go landlord nay nay but you are in such a hurry to pay -- you won't hear a man half this is enough for your share o' the mischief in all conscience mr wheeler there had the horse on the same day wheel but bursal's my witness -- talb oh say no more about witnesses a man's conscience is always his best witness or his worst landlord take your money and no more words wheel this is very genteel of you talbot i always thought you would do the genteel thing as i knew you to be so generous and considerate talb don't waste your fine speeches wheeler i advise you this election time keep them for bursal or lord john or some of those who like them they won't go down with me good morning to you i give you notice i'm going back to eton as fast as i can gallop and who knows what plain speaking may do with the eton lads i may be captain yet wheeler have a care is my horse ready there landlord mr talbot's horse there mr talbot's horse i say talbot sings he carries weight -- he rides a race -- 'tis for a thousand pound exit talbot wheel and dear me i shall be left behind a horse for me pray a horse for mr wheeler exit wheeler landlord calls very loud mr talbot's horse hang the hostler i'll saddle him myself exit landlord scene ii a dining room in the inn at salt hill mrs talbot and louisa louisa laughing with what an air mrs landlady made her exit mrs talbot when i was young they say i was proud but i am humble enough now these petty mortifications do not vex me louisa it is well my brother was gone before mrs landlady made her entree for if he had heard her rude speech he would at least have given her the retort courteous mrs talb now tell me honestly my louisa -- you were a few days ago at bursal house since you have left it and have felt something of the difference that is made in this world between splendour and no splendour you have never regretted that you did not stay there and that you did not bear more patiently with miss bursal's little airs louisa never for a moment at first miss bursal paid me a vast deal of attention but for what reason i know not she suddenly changed her manner grew first strangely cold then condescendingly familiar and at last downright rude i could not guess the cause of these variations mrs talb aside i guess the cause too well louisa but as i perceived the lady was out of tune i was in haste to leave her i should make a very bad and i am sure a miserable toad eater i had much rather if i were obliged to choose earn my own bread than live as toad eater with anybody mrs talb fine talking dear louisa louisa don't you believe me to be in earnest mother to be sure you cannot know what i would do unless i were put to the trial mrs talb nor you either my dear she sighs and is silent louisa takes her mother's hand what is the matter dear mother you used to say that seeing my brother always made you feel ten years younger yet even while he was here you had in spite of all your efforts to conceal them those sudden fits of sadness mrs talb the montem -- is not it to-morrow ay but my boy is not sure of being captain louisa no there is one wheeler who as he says is most likely to be chosen captain he has taken prodigious pains to flatter and win over many to his interest my brother does not so much care about it he is not avaricious mrs talb i love your generous spirit and his but alas my dear people may live to want and wish for money without being avaricious i would not say a word to talbot full of spirits as he was this morning i would not say a word to him till after the montem of what has happened louisa and what has happened dear mother sit down -- you tremble mrs talb sits down and puts a letter into louisa's hand read that love a messenger brought me that from town a few hours ago louisa reads by an express from portsmouth we hear the bombay castle east indiaman is lost with all your fortune on board all i hope there is something left for you to live upon mrs talb about 15o pounds a year for us all louisa that is enough is it not for you mrs talb for me love i am an old woman and want but little in this world and shall be soon out of it louisa kneels down beside her do not speak so dearest mother mrs talb enough for me love yes enough and too much for me i am not thinking of myself louisa then as to my brother he has such abilities and such industry he will make a fortune at the bar for himself most certainly mrs talb but his education is not completed how shall we provide him with money at cambridge louisa this montem the last time the captain had eight hundred the time before a thousand pounds oh i hope -- i fear now indeed i know that without being avaricious we may want and wish for money landlady's voice heard behind the scenes landlady waiter -- miss bursal's curricle and mr bursal's vis-a-vis run see that the dolphin's empty i say run -- run mrs talb i will rest for a few moments upon the sofa in this bedchamber before we set off louisa goes to open the door they have bolted or locked it how unlucky she turns the key and tries to unlock the door enter waiter waiter ladies i'm sorry -- miss bursal and mr bursal are come -- just coming upstairs mrs talb then will you be so good sir as to unlock this door waiter tries to unlock the door waiter it must be bolted on the inside chambermaid sally are you within there unbolt this door mr bursal's voice behind the scenes mr burs let me have a basin of good soup directly waiter i'll go round and have the door unbolted immediately ladies exit waiter enter miss bursal in a riding dress and with a long whip miss bursal those creatures the ponies have a'most pulled my 'and off who 'ave we 'ere ha mrs talbot louisa 'ow are ye i'm so vastly glad to see you but i'm so shocked to 'ear of the loss of the bombay castle mrs talbot you look but poorly but this montem will put everybody in spirits i 'ear everybody's to be 'ere and my brother tells me 'twill be the finest ever seen at heton louisa my dear i'm sorry i've not a seat for you in my curricle for to-morrow but i've promised lady betty so you know 'tis impossible for me louisa certainly and it would be impossible for me to leave my mother at present chambermaid opens the bedchamber door the room's ready now ladies mrs talb miss bursal we intrude upon you no longer miss burs nay why do you decamp mrs talbot i 'ad a thousand things to say to you louisa but am so tired and so annoyed -- seats herself exeunt mrs talbot louisa and chambermaid enter mr bursal with a basin of soup in his hand mr burs well thank my stars the airly castle is safe in the downs miss burs mr bursal can you inform me why joe my groom does not make his appearance mr burs eating and speaking yes that i can child because he is with his 'orses where he ought to be 'tis fit they should be looked after well for they cost me a pretty penny -- more than their heads are worth and yours into the bargain but i was resolved as we were to come to this montem to come in style miss burs in style to be sure for all the world's to be here -- the king the prince of whales and duke o' york and all the first people and we shall cut a dash dash dash will be the word to-morrow -- playing with her whip mr burs aside dash dash ay just like her brother he'll pay away finely i warrant by the time he's her age well well he can afford it and i do love to see my children make a figure for their money as jack bursal says what's money for if it e'nt to make a figure aloud there's your brother jack now the extravagant dog he'll have such a dress as never was seen i suppose at this here montem why now jack bursal spends more money at eton and has more to spend than my lord john though my lord john's the son of a marchioness miss burs oh that makes no difference nowadays i wonder whether her ladyship is to be at this montem the only good i ever got out of these stupid talbots was an introduction to their friend lady piercefield what she could find to like in the talbots heaven knows i've a notion she'll drop them when she hears of the loss of the bombay castle enter a waiter with a note waiter a note from my lady piercefield sir miss b charming woman is she here pray sir waiter just come yes ma'am exit waiter miss b well mr bursal what is it mr b reads business of importance to communicate -- hum what can it be -- going miss b aside perhaps some match to propose for me aloud mr bursal pray before you go to her ladyship do send my ooman to me to make me presentable exit miss bursal at one door mr b at the opposite door business of importance hum i'm glad i'm prepared with a good basin of soup there's no doing business well upon an empty stomach perhaps the business is to lend cash and i've no great stomach for that but it will be an honour to be sure exit scene iii landlady's parlour landlady -- mr finsbury a man-milliner with bandboxes -- a fancy cap or helmet with feathers in the landlady's hand -- a satin bag covered with gold netting in the man-milliner's hand -- a mantle hanging over his arm a rough looking farmer is sitting with his back towards them eating bread and cheese and reading a newspaper landlady well this to be sure will be the best dressed montem that ever was seen at eton and you lon'on gentlemen have the most fashionablest notions and this is the most elegantest fancy cap -- finsbury why as you observe ma'm that is the most elegant fancy cap of them all that is mr hector hogmorton's fancy cap ma'm and here ma'm is mr saul's rich satin bag covered with gold net he is college salt bearer i understand and has a prodigious superb white and gold dress but in my humble opinion ma'm the marshal's white and purple and orange fancy dress trimmed with silver will bear the bell though indeed i shouldn't say that -- for the colonel's and lieutenant's and ensign's are beautiful in the extreme and to be sure nothing could be better imagined than mr marlborough's lilac and silver with a roman cap and it must be allowed that nothing in nature can have a better effect than mr drake's flesh-colour and blue with this spanish hat ma'm you see the farmer looks over his shoulder from time to time during this speech with contempt farmer reads the newspaper french fleet at sea -- hum landlady o gemini mr drake's spanish hat is the sweetest tastiest thing mr finsbury i protest -- finsb why ma'm i knew a lady of your taste couldn't but approve of it my own invention entirely ma'm but it's nothing to the captain's cap ma'm indeed ma'm mr wheeler the captain that is to be has the prettiest taste in dress to be sure his sandals were my suggestion but the mantle he has the entire credit of to do him justice and when you see it ma'm you will be really surprised for for contrast and elegance and richness and lightness and propriety and effect and costume you've never yet seen anything at all to be compared to captain wheeler's mantle ma'm farmer to the landlady why now pray mrs landlady how long may it have been the fashion for milliners to go about in men's clothes landlady aside to farmer lord mr hearty hush this is mr finsbury the great man-milliner farm the great man-milliner this is a sight i never thought to see in old england finsb packing up band boxes well ma'm i'm glad i have your approbation it has ever been my study to please the ladies farm throws a fancy mantle over his frieze coat and is this the way to please the ladies mrs landlady nowadays finsb taking off the mantle sir with your leave -- i ask pardon -- but the least thing detriments these tender colours and as you have just been eating cheese with your hands -- farm 'tis my way to eat cheese with my mouth man finsb man farm i ask pardon -- man-milliner i mean enter landlord landlord why wife landlady wife landlord i ask pardon -- mrs newington i mean do you know who them ladies are that you have been and turned out of the dolphin landlady alarmed not i indeed who are they pray why if they are quality it's no fault of mine it is their own fault for coming like scrubs without four horses why if quality will travel the road this way incognito how can they expect to be known and treated as quality 'tis no fault of mine why didn't you find out sooner who they were mr newington what else in the 'versal world have you to do but to go basking about in the yards and places with your tankard in your hand from morning till night what have you else to ruminate all day long but to find out who's who i say farm clapper clapper clapper like my mill in a high wind landlord clapper clapper clapper -- enough to stun a body landlord that is not used to it but use is all they say landlady will you answer me mr newington who are the grandees that were in the dolphin -- and what's become on them landlord grandees was your own word wife they be not to call grandees but i reckon you'd be sorry not to treat 'em civil when i tell you their name is talbot mother and sister to our young talbot of eton he that paid me so handsome for the hunter this very morning landlady mercy is that all what a combustion for nothing in life finsb for nothing in life as you say ma'm that is nothing in high life i'm sure ma'm nay i dare a'most venture to swear would you believe it mr talbot is one of the few young gentlemen of eton that has not bespoke from me a fancy dress for this grand montem landlady there mr newington there's your talbot for you and there's your grandees o trust me i know your scrubs at first sight landlord scrubs i don't nor can't nor won't call them that pay their debts honestly scrubs i don't nor won't nor can't call them that behave as handsome as young mr talbot did here to me this morning about the hunter a scrub he is not wife fancy-dress or no fancy-dress mr finsbury this young gentleman is no scrub finsb dear me 'twas not i said scrub did i say scrub farm no matter if you did finsb no matter certainly and yet it is a matter for i'm confident i wouldn't for the world leave it in anyone's power to say that i said -- that i called -- any young gentleman of eton a scrub why you know sir it might breed a riot farm and a pretty figure you'd make in a riot landlady pray let me hear nothing about riots in my house farm nor about scrubs finsb but i beg leave to explain gentlemen all i ventured to remark or suggest was that as there was some talk of mr talbot's being captain to-morrow i didn't conceive how he could well appear without any dress that was all upon my word and honour a good morning to you gentlemen it is time for me to be off mrs newington you were so obliging as to promise to accommodate me with a return chaise as far as eton finsbury bows and exit farm a good day to you and your bandboxes there's a fellow for you now ha ha ha -- a man-milliner forsooth landlord mrs talbot's coming -- stand back landlady lord why does bob show them through this way enter mrs talbot leaning on louisa waiter showing the way landlady you are going on i suppose ma'am waiter aside to landlord not if she could help it but there's no beds since mr bursal and miss bursal's come landlord i say nothing for it is vain to say more but isn't it a pity she can't stay for the montem poor old lady her son -- as good and fine a lad as ever you saw -- they say has a chance too of being captain she may never live to see another such a sight as mrs talbot walks slowly on the farmer puts himself across her way so as to stop her short farm no offence madam i hope but i have a good snug farm house not far off hand and if so be you'd be so good to take a night's lodging you and the young lady with you you'd have a hearty welcome that's all i can say and you'd make my wife very happy for she's a good woman to say nothing of myself landlord if i may be so bold to put in my word madam you'd have as good beds and be as well lodged with farmer hearty as in e'er a house at salt hill mrs talb i am very much obliged -- farm o say nothing o' that madam i am sure i shall be as much obliged if you do come do miss speak for me louisa pray dear mother -- farm she will calls behind the scenes here waiter hostler driver what's your name drive the chaise up here to the door smart close lean on my arm madam and we'll have you in and home in a whiff exeunt mrs talbot louisa farmer landlord and waiter landlady sola what a noise and a rout this farmer man makes and my husband with his great broad face bowing as great a nincompoop as t'other the folks are all bewitched with the old woman i verily believe aloud a good morning to you ladies end of the first act act the second scene i a field near eton college -- several boys crossing backwards and forwards in the back-ground in front talbot wheeler lord john and bursal talbot fair play wheeler have at 'em my boy there they stand fair game there's bursal there with his dead forty-five votes at command and lord john with his -- how many live friends lord john

fifty-six friends wheeler inclusive hey my lord hey my lud lord j talbot exclusive i find contrary to my expectations talb ay contrary to your expectations you find that talbot is not a dog that will lick the dust but then there's enough of the true spaniel breed to be had for whistling for hey wheeler bursal aside to wheeler a pretty electioneerer so much the better for you wheeler why unless he bought a vote he'd never win one if he talked from this to the day of judgment wheeler aside to bursal and as he has no money to buy votes -- he he he -- we are safe enough talb that's well done wheeler fight the by-battle there with bursal now you are sure of the main with lord john lord j sure i never made mr wheeler any promise yet wheel o i ask no promise from his lordship we are upon honour i trust entirely to his lordship's good nature and generosity and to his regard for his own family i having the honour though distantly to be related lord j related how wheeler wheel connected i mean which is next door as i may say to being related related slipped out by mistake i beg pardon my lord john lord j related -- a strange mistake wheeler talb overshot yourself wheeler overshot yourself by all that's awkward and yet till now i always took you for a dead-shot at a yellow-hammer young noblemen at oxford wear yellow tufts at the tops of their caps hence their flatterers are said to be dead-shots at yellow-hammers wheel taking bursal by the arm bursal a word with you aside to bursal what a lump of family pride that lord john is talb keep out of my hearing wheeler lest i should spoil sport but never fear you'll please bursal sooner than i shall i can't for the soul of me bring myself to say that bursal's not purse-proud and you can give you joy burs a choice electioneerer -- ha ha ha wheel faintly he he he -- a choice electioneerer as you say exeunt wheeler and bursal manent lord j and talbot lord j there was a time talbot -- talb there was a time my lord -- to save trouble and a long explanation- -there was a time when you liked talbots better than spaniels you understand me lord j i have found it very difficult to understand you of late mr talbot talb yes because you have used other people's understandings instead of your own be yourself my lord see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears and then you'll find me still what i've been these seven years not your understrapper your hanger-on your flatterer but your friend if you choose to have me for a friend here's my hand i am your friend and you'll not find a better lord j giving his hand you are a strange fellow talbot i thought i never could have forgiven you for what you said last night talb what for i don't keep a register of my sayings oh it was something about gaming -- wheeler was flattering your taste for it and he put me into a passion -- i forget what i said but whatever it was i'm sure it was well meant and i believe it was well said lord j but you laugh at me sometimes to my face talb would you rather i should laugh at you behind your back lord j but of all things in the world i hate to be laughed at listen to me and don't fumble in your pockets while i'm talking to you talb i'm fumbling for -- oh here it is now lord john i once did laugh at you behind your back and what's droll enough it was at your back i laughed here's a caricature i drew of you -- i really am sorry i did it but 'tis best to show it to you myself lord j aside it is all i can do to forgive this after a pause he tears the paper i have heard of this caricature before but i did not expect talbot that you would come and show it to me yourself talbot so handsomely especially at such a time as this wheeler might well say you are a bad electioneerer talb oh hang it i forgot my election and your fifty-six friends enter rory o'ryan rory claps talbot on the back fifty-six friends have you talbot say seven -- fifty-seven i mean for i'll lay you a wager you've forget me and that's a shame for you too for out of the whole posse-comitatus entirely now you have not a stauncher friend than poor little rory o'ryan and a good right he has to befriend you for you stood by him when many who ought to have known better were hunting him down for a wild irishman now that same wild irishman has as much gratitude in him as any tame englishman of them all but don't let's be talking sintimint for for my share i'd not give a bogberry a bushel for sintimint when i could get anything better lord j and pray sir what may a bogberry be rory phoo don't be playing the innocent now where have you lived all your life i ask pardon my lard not to know a bogberry when you see or hear of it turns to talbot but what are ye standing idling here for sure there's wheeler and bursal along with him canvassing out yonder at a terrible fine rate and haven't i been huzzaing for you there till i'm hoarse so i am and just stepped away to suck an orange for my voice -- sucks an orange i am a thorough going friend at anyrate talb now rory you are the best fellow in the world and a thorough going friend but have a care or you'll get yourself and me into some scrape before you have done with this violent thorough going work rory never fear never fear man -- a warm frind and a bitter enemy that's my maxim talb yes but too warm a friend is as bad as a bitter enemy rory oh never fear me i'm as cool as a cucumber all the time and whilst they tink i'm tinking of nothing in life but making a noise i make my own snug little remarks in prose and verse as -- now my voice is after coming back to me you shall hear if you plase talb i do please rory i call it rory's song now mind i have a verse for everybody -- o' the leading lads i mean and i shall put 'em in or lave 'em out according to their inclinations and deserts wise-a-wee to you my little frind so you comprehend it will be rory's song with variations talbot and lord john let's have it let's have it without further preface rory sings i'm true game to the last and no wheeler for me rory there's a stroke in the first place for wheeler -- you take it talb o yes yes we take it go on rory sings i'm true game to the last and no wheeler for me of all birds beasts or fishes that swim in the sea webb'd or finn'd black or white man or child whig or tory none but talbot o talbot's the dog for rory talb talbot the dog is much obliged to you lord j but if i have any ear one of your lines is a foot too long mr o'ryan rory phoo put the best foot foremost for a frind slur it in the singing and don't be quarrelling anyhow for a foot more or less the more feet the better it will stand you know only let me go on and you'll come to something that will plase you rory sings then there's he with the purse that's as long as my arm rory that's bursal mind now whom i mean to allude to in this verse lord j if the allusion's good we shall probably find out your meaning talb on with you rory and don't read us notes on a song lord j go on and let us hear what you say of bursal rory sings then there's he with the purse that's as long as my arm his father's a tanner -- but then where's the harm heir to houses and hunters and horseponds in fee won't his skins sure soon buy him a pedigree lord j encore encore why rory i did not think you could make so good a song rory sure 'twas none of i made it -- 'twas talbot here talb i rory aside not a word i'll make you a present of it sure then it's your own talb i never wrote a word of it rory to lord j phoo phoo he's only denying it out of false modesty lord j well no matter who wrote it -- sing it again rory be easy so i will and as many more verses as you will to the back of it winking at talbot aside you shall have the credit of all aloud put me in when i'm out talbot and you to lord john join -- join rory sings and lord john sings with him then there's he with the purse that's as long as my arm his father's a tanner -- but then where's the harm heir to houses and hunters and horseponds in fee won't his skins sure soon buy him a pedigree there's my lord with the back that never was bent -- lord john stops singing talbot makes signs to rory to stop but rory does not see him and sings on there's my lord with the back that never was bent let him live with his ancestors i am content rory pushes lord j and talbot with his elbows rory join join both of ye -- why don't you join sings who'll buy my lord john the arch fishwoman cried a nice oyster shut up in a choice shell of pride rory but join or ye spoil all talb you have spoiled all indeed lord j making a formal low bow mr talbot lord john thanks you rory lord john blood and thunder i forgot you were by -- quite and clean lord j puts him aside and continues speaking to talbot lord john thanks you mr talbot this is the second part of the caricature lord john thanks you for these proofs of friendship -- lord john has reason to thank you mr talbot rory no reason in life now don't be thanking so much for nothing in life or if you must be thanking of somebody it's me you ought to thank lord j i ought and do sir for unmasking one who -- talb warmly unmasking my lord -- rory holding them asunder phoo phoo phoo be easy can't ye -- there's no unmasking at all in the case my lord john talbot's writing the song was all a mistake lord j as much a mistake as your singing it sir i presume -- rory just as much 'twas all a mistake so now don't you go and make a mistake into a misunderstanding it was i made every word of the song out o' the face -- that about the back that never was bent and the ancestors of the oyster and all he did not waste a word of it upon my conscience i wrote it all -- though i'll engage you didn't think i could write a good thing lord john turns away i'm telling you the truth and not a word of a lie and yet you won't believe me from beginning to end lord j you will excuse me sir if i cannot believe two contradictory assertions within two minutes mr talbot i thank you going rory tries to stop lord john from going but cannot -- exit lord john rory well if he will go let him go then and much good may it do him nay but don't you go too talb o rory what have you done -- talbot runs after lord j hear me my lord exit talbot rory hear him hear him hear him -- well i'm point blank mad with myself for making this blunder but how could i help it as sure as ever i am meaning to do the best thing on earth it turns out the worst enter a party of lads huzzaing rory joins huzza huzza -- who pray are ye huzzaing for 1st boy wheeler wheeler for ever huzza rory talbot talbot for ever huzza captain talbot for ever huzza 2nd boy captain he'll never be -- at least not to-morrow for lord john has just declared for wheeler lst boy and that turns the scale rory oh the

at your jokes -- he he he -- ready to kill myself burs sullenly you are easily killed then if that much laughing will do the business wheel coughing just then -- something stuck in my throat i beg your pardon burs still sullen oh you need not beg my pardon about the matter i don't care whether you laugh or no -- not i now you have got lord john to declare for you you are above laughing at my jokes i suppose wheel no upon my word and honour i did laugh burs aside a fig for your word and honour aloud i know i'm of no consequence now but you'll remember that if his lordship has the honour of making you captain he must have the honour to pay for your captain's accoutrements for i sha'n't pay the piper i promise you since i'm of no consequence wheel of no consequence but my dear bursal what could put that into your head that's the strangest oddest fancy of no consequence bursal of no consequence why everybody that knows anything -- everybody that has seen bursal house -- knows that you are of the greatest consequence my dear bursal burs taking out his watch and opening it looks at it no i'm of no consequence i wonder that rascal finsbury is not come yet with the dresses still looking at his watch wheel aside if bursal takes it into his head not to lend me the money to pay for my captain's dress what will become of me for i have not a shilling -- and lord john won't pay for me -- and finsbury has orders not to leave the house till he is paid by everybody what will become of me -- bites his nails burs aside how i love to make him bite his nails aloud i know i'm of no consequence strikes his repeater wheel what a fine repeater that is of yours bursal it is the best i ever heard burs so it well may be for it cost a mint of money wheel no matter to you what anything costs happy dog as you are you roll in money and yet you talk of being of no consequence burs but i am not of half so much consequence as lord john -- am i wheel are you why aren't you twice as rich as he burs very true but i'm not purse-proud wheel you purse-proud i should never have thought of such a thing burs nor i if talbot had not used the word wheel but talbot thinks everybody purse-proud that has a purse burs aside well this wheeler does put one into a good humour with one's self in spite of one's teeth aloud talbot says blunt things but i don't think he's what you can call clever -- hey wheeler wheel clever oh not he burs i think i could walk round him wheel to be sure you could why do you know i've quizzed him famously myself within this quarter of an hour burs indeed i wish i had been by wheel so do i 'faith it was the best thing i wanted you see to get him out of my way that i might have the field clear for electioneering to-day so i bowls up to him with a long face -- such a face as this mr talbot do you know -- i'm sorry to tell you here's jack smith has just brought the news from salt hill your mother in getting into the carriage slipped and has broke her leg and there she's lying at a farmhouse two miles off is not it true jack said i i saw the farmer helping her in with my own eyes cries jack off goes talbot like an arrow quizzed him quizzed him said i burs ha ha ha quizzed him indeed with all his cleverness that was famously done wheel ha ha ha with all his cleverness he will be all the evening hunting for the farmhouse and the mother that has broke her leg so he is out of our way burs but what need have you to want him out of your way now lord john has come over to your side you have the thing at a dead beat wheel not so dead either for there's a great independent party you know and if you don't help me bursal to canvass them i shall be no captain it is you i depend upon after all will you come and canvass them with me dear bursal pray -- all depends upon you pulls him by the arm -- bursal follows burs well if all depends upon me i'll see what i can do for you aside then i am of some consequence money makes a man of some consequence i see

flowers etc are dancing and singing enter patty dressed as the queen of the festival with a lamb in her arms the dancers break off when she comes in and direct their attention towards her 1st peasant oh here comes patty here comes the queen o' the day what has kept you from us so long patty 2nd peasant please your majesty you should say patty this poor little lamb of mine was what kept me so long it strayed away from the rest and i should have lost him so i should for ever if it had not been for a good young gentleman yonder he is talking to farmer hearty that's the young gentleman who pulled my lamb out of the ditch for me into which he had fallen -- pretty creature 1st peasant pretty creature -- or your majesty whichever you choose to be called -- come and dance with them and i'll carry your lamb exeunt singing and dancing enter farmer hearty and talbot farmer why young gentleman i'm glad i happened to light upon you here and so to hinder you from going farther astray and set your heart at ease like talb thanks good farmer you have set my heart at ease indeed but the truth is they did frighten me confoundedly -- more fool i farm no fool at all to my notion i should at your age ay or at my age just the self-same way have been frightened myself if so be that mention had been made to me that way of my own mother's having broke her leg or so and greater by a great deal the shame for them that frighted you than for you to be frighted how young gentlemen now can bring themselves for to tell such lies is to me now a matter of amazement like that i can't noways get over talb oh farmer such lies are very witty though you and i don't just now like the wit of them this is fun this is quizzing but you don't know what we young gentlemen mean by quizzing farm ay but i do though to my cost ever since last year look you now at yon fine field of wheat well it was just as fine and finer last year till a young eton jackanapes -- talb take care what you say farmer for i am a young eton jackanapes farm no but you be not the young eton jackanapes that i'm a-thinking on i tell you it was this time last year man he was a-horseback i tell ye mounted upon a fine bay hunter out a-hunting like talb i tell you it was this time last year man that i was mounted upon a fine bay hunter out a-hunting farm zooks would you argufy a man out of his wits you won't go for to tell me that you are that impertinent little jackanapes talb no no i'll not tell you that i am an impertinent little jackanapes farm wiping his forehead well don't then for i can't believe it and you put me out where was i talb mounted upon a fine bay hunter farm ay so he was here you says he meaning me -- open this gate for me now if he had but a-spoke me fair i would not have gainsaid him but he falls to swearing so i bid him open the gate for himself there's a bull behind you farmer says he i turns quizzed him cries my jackanapes and off he gallops him through the very thick of my corn but he got a fall leaping the ditch out yonder which pacified me like at the minute so i goes up to see whether he was killed but he was not a whit the worse for his tumble so i should ha' fell into a passion with him then to be sure about my corn but his horse had got such a terrible sprain i couldn't say anything to him for i was a- pitying the poor animal as fine a hunter as ever you saw i am sartain sure he could never come to good after talb aside i do think from the description that this was wheeler and i have paid for the horse which he spoiled aloud should you know either the man or the horse again if you were to see them farm ay that i should to my dying day talb will you come with me then and you'll do me some guineas' worth of service farm ay that i will with a deal of pleasure for you be a civil spoken young gentleman and besides i don't think the worse on you for being frighted a little about your mother being what i might ha' been at your age myself for i had a mother myself once

interest my friends perhaps have not been offended though i have by mr talbot i shall leave them to their own inclinations burs whistling wheugh wheugh wheugh wheeler the principal's nothing without the interest wheel oh the interest will go along with the principal of course for i'm persuaded if my lord leaves his friends to their inclinations it will be the inclination of my lord's friends to vote as he does if he says nothing to them to the contrary lord j i told you mr wheeler that i should leave them to themselves burs still whistling well i'll do my best to make that father of mine send me off to oxford i'm sure i'm fit to go -- along with wheeler why you'd best be my tutor wheeler -- a devilish good thought wheel an excellent thought burs and a cursed fine dust we should kick

for the life of me i couldn't be after begging so many pardons for nothing at all but many men many minds -- hums true game to the last no wheeler for me oh murder i forgot i was nigh letting the cat out o' the bag again lord j you had something to say to me sir i wait till your recollection returns rory 'faith and that's very kind of you and if you had always done so you would never have been offended with me my lord lord j you are mistaken mr o'ryan if you think that you did or could offend me rory mistaken was i then sure enough but we are all liable to mistakes and should forget and forgive one another that's the way to go through lord j you will go through the world your own way mr o'ryan and allow me to go through it my way rory very fair -- fair enough -- then we shan't cross but now to come to the point i don't like to be making disagreeable retrospects if i could any way avoid it nor to be going about the bush especially at this time o' day when as mr finsbury's come we've not so much time to lose as we had is there any truth then my lord in the report that is going about this hour past that you have gone in a huff and given your promise there to that sneaking wheeler to vote for him now lord j in answer to your question sir i am to inform you that i have promised mr wheeler to vote for him rory in a huff -- ay now there it is -- well when a man's mad to be sure he's mad -- and that's all that can be said about it and i know if i had been mad myself i might have done a foolish thing as well as another but now my lord that you are not mad -- lord j i protest sir i cannot understand you in one word sir i'm neither mad nor a fool -- your most obedient going angrily rory holding him take care now you are going mad with me again but phoo i like you the better for being mad i'm very often mad myself and i would not give a potato for one that had never been mad in his life lord j aside he'll not be quiet till he makes me knock him down rory agh agh agh -- i begin to guess whereabouts i am at last mad in your country i take it means fit for bedlam but with us in ireland now 'tis no such thing it mean's nothing in life but the being in a passion well one comfort is my lord as you're a bit of a scholar we have the latin proverb in our favour -- ira furor brevis est anger is short madness the shorter the better i think so my lord to put an end to whatever of the kind you may have felt against poor talbot i'll assure you he's as innocent o' that unfortunate song as the babe unborn lord j it is rather late for mr talbot to make apologies to me rory he make apologies not he 'faith he'd send me to coventry or maybe to a worse place did he but know i was condescending to make this bit of explanation unknown to him but upon my conscience i've a regard for you both and don't like to see you go together by the ears now look you my lord by this book and all the books that were ever shut and opened he never saw or heard of that unlucky song of mine till i came out with it this morning lord j but you told me this morning that it was he who wrote it rory for that i take shame to myself as it turned out but it was only a white lie to sarve a friend and make him cut a dash with a new song at election time but i've done for ever with white lies lord j walking about as if agitated i wish you had never begun with them mr o'ryan this may be a good joke to you but it is none to me or talbot so talbot never wrote a word of the song rory not a word or syllable good or bad lord j and i have given my promise to vote against him he'll lose his election rory not if you'll give me leave to speak to your friends in your name lord j i have promised to leave them to themselves and wheeler i am sure has engaged them by this time rory bless my body i'll not stay prating here then exit rory lord j follows but what can have become of talbot i have been too hasty for once in my life well i shall suffer for it more than anybody else for i love talbot since he did not make the song of which i hate to think exit scene iii a large hall in eton college -- a staircase at the end -- eton lads dressed in their montem dresses in the

thought finsbury knew you too well to give you credit for anything fins you are pleased to be pleasant sir mr wheeler knows in that sense of the word it is out of my power to give him credit and i'm sure he would not ask it wheel aside o bursal pay him and i'll pay you tomorrow burs now if you weren't to be captain after all wheeler what a pretty figure you'd cut ha ha ha -- hey wheel oh i am as

stupid starers and of loud huzzas curtain falls forgive and forget in the neighbourhood of a seaport town in the west of england there lived a gardener who had one son called maurice to whom he was very partial one day his father sent him to the neighbouring town to purchase some garden seeds for him when maurice got to the seed-shop it was full of people who were all impatient to be served first a great tall man and next a great fat woman pushed before him and he stood quietly beside the counter waiting till somebody should be at leisure to attend to him at length when all the other people who were in the shop had got what they wanted the shopman turned to maurice -- and what do you want my patient little fellow said he i want all these seeds for my father said maurice putting a list of seeds into the shopman's hand and i have brought money to pay for them all the seedsman looked out all the seeds that maurice wanted and packed them up in paper he was folding up some painted lady-peas when from a door at the back of the shop there came in a square rough-faced man who exclaimed the moment he came in are the seeds i ordered ready -- the wind's fair -- they ought to have been aboard yesterday and my china jar is it packed up and directed where is it it is up there on the shelf over your head sir answered the seedsman it is very safe you see but we have not had time to pack it yet it shall be done to-day and we will get the seeds ready for you sir immediately immediately then stir about it the seeds will not pack themselves up make haste pray immediately sir as soon as i have done up the parcel for this little boy what signifies the parcel for this little boy he can wait and i cannot -- wind and tide wait for no man here my good lad take your parcel and sheer off said the impatient man and as he spoke he took up the parcel of seeds from the counter as the shopman stooped to look for a sheet of thick brown paper and packthread to tie it up the parcel was but loosely folded up and as the impatient man lifted it the weight of the peas which were withinside of it burst the paper and all the seeds fell out upon the floor whilst maurice in vain held his hands to catch them the peas rolled to all parts of the shop the impatient man swore at them but maurice without being out of humour set about collecting them as fast as possible whilst the boy was busied in this manner the man got what seeds he wanted and as he was talking about them a sailor came into the shop and said captain the wind has changed within these five minutes and it looks as if we should have ugly weather well i'm glad of it replied the rough faced man who was the captain of a ship i am glad to have a day longer to stay ashore and i've business enough on my hands the captain pushed forward towards the shop door maurice who was kneeling on the floor picking up his seeds saw that the captain's foot was entangled in some packthread which hung down from the shelf on which the china jar stood maurice saw that if the captain took one more step forward he must pull the string so that it would throw down the jar round the bottom of which the packthread was entangled he immediately caught hold of the captain's leg and stopped him stay stand still sir said he or you will break your china jar the man stood still looked and saw how the packthread had caught in his shoe buckle and how it was near dragging down his beautiful china jar i am really very much obliged to you my little fellow said he you have saved my jar which i would not have broken for ten guineas for it is for my wife and i've brought it safe from abroad many a league it would have been a pity if i had broken it just when it was safe landed i am really much obliged to you my little fellow this was returning good for evil i am sorry i threw down your seeds as you are such a good natured forgiving boy be so kind continued he turning to the shopman as to reach down that china jar for me the shopman lifted down the jar very carefully and the captain took off the cover and pulled out some tulip roots you seem by the quantity of seeds you have got to belong to a gardener are you fond of gardening said he to maurice yes sir replied maurice very fond of it for my father is a gardener and he lets me help him at his work and he has given me a little garden of my own then here are a couple of tulip-roots for you and if you take care of them i'll promise you that you will have the finest tulips in england in your little garden these tulips were given to me by a dutch merchant who told me that they were some of the rarest and finest in holland they will prosper with you i'm sure wind and weather permitting maurice thanked the gentleman and returned home eager to show his precious tulip-roots to his father and to a companion of his the son of a nurseryman who lived near him arthur was the name of the nurseryman's son the first thing maurice did after showing his tulip-roots to his father was to run to arthur's garden in search of him their gardens were separated only by a low wall of loose stones arthur arthur where are you are you in your garden i want you but arthur made no answer and did not as usual come running to meet his friend i know where you are continued maurice and i'm coming to you as fast as the raspberry-bushes will let me i have good news for you -- something you'll be delighted to see arthur -- ha -- but here is something that i am not delighted to see i am sure said poor maurice who when he had got through the raspberry-bushes and had come in sight of his own garden beheld his bell-glass -- his beloved bell-glass under which his cucumbers were grown so finely -- his only bell-glass broken to pieces i am sorry for it said arthur who stood leaning upon his spade in his own garden i am afraid you will be very angry with me why was it you arthur broke my bell-glass oh how could you do so i was throwing weeds and rubbish over the wall and by accident a great lump of couch-grass with stones hanging to the roots fell upon your bell-glass and broke it as you see maurice lifted up the lump of couch-grass which had fallen through the broken glass upon his cucumbers and he looked at his cucumbers for a moment in silence -- oh my poor cucumbers you must all die now i shall see all your yellow flowers withered tomorrow but it is done and it cannot be helped so arthur let us say no more about it you are very good i thought you would have been angry i am sure i should have been exceedingly angry if you had broken the glass if it had been mine oh forgive and forget as my father always says that's the best way look what i have got for you then he told arthur the story of the captain of the ship and the china jar the seeds having been thrown down and of the fine tulip-roots which had been given to him and maurice concluded by offering one of the precious roots to arthur who thanked him with great joy and repeatedly said how good you were not to be angry with me for breaking your bell-glass i am much more sorry for it than if you had been in a passion with me arthur now went to plant his tulip-root and maurice looked at the beds which his companion had been digging and at all the things which were coming up in his garden i don't know how it is said arthur but you always seem as glad to see the things in my garden coming up and doing well as if they were all your own i am much happier since my father came to live here and since you and i have been allowed to work and to play together than i ever was before for you must know before we came to live here i had a cousin in the house with me who used to plague me he was not nearly so good-natured as you are he never took pleasure in looking at my garden or at anything that i did that was well done and he never gave me a share of anything that he had and so i did not like him how could i but i believe that hating people makes us unhappy for i know i never was happy when i was quarrelling with him and i am always happy with you maurice you know we never quarrel it would be well for all the world if they could be convinced like arthur that to live in friendship is better than to quarrel it would be well for all the world if they followed maurice's maxim of forgive and forget when they receive or when they imagine that they receive an injury arthur's father mr oakly the nurseryman was apt to take offence at trifles and when he thought that any of his neighbours disobliged him he was too proud to ask them to explain their conduct therefore he was often mistaken in his judgment of them he thought that it showed spirit to remember and to resent an injury and therefore though he was not an ill-natured man he was sometimes led by this mistaken idea of spirit to do ill-natured things a warm friend and a bitter enemy was one of his maxims and he had many more enemies than friends he was not very rich but he was proud and his favourite proverb was better live in spite than in pity when first he settled near mr grant the gardener he felt inclined to dislike him because he was told that mr grant was a scotchman and he had a prejudice against scotchmen all of whom he believed to be cunning and avaricious because he had once been over-reached by a scotch peddler grant's friendly manners in some degree conquered this prepossession but still he secretly suspected that this civility as he said was all show and that he was not nor could not being a scotchman be such a hearty friend as a true-born englishman grant had some remarkably fine raspberries the fruit was so large as to be quite a curiosity when it was in season many strangers came from the neighbouring town which was a sea-bathing place to look at these raspberries which obtained the name of brobdingnag raspberries how came you pray neighbour grant if a man may ask by these wonderful fine raspberries said mr oakly one evening to the gardener that's a secret replied grant with an arch smile oh in case it's a secret i've no more to say for i never meddle with any man's secrets that he does not choose to trust me with but i wish neighbour grant you would put down that book you are always poring over some book or another when a man comes to see you which is not according to my notions being a plain unlarned englishman bred and born so civil and neighbourly as might be mr grant hastily shut his book but remarked with a shrewd glance at his son that it was in that book he found his brobdingnag raspberries you are pleased to be pleasant upon them that have not the luck to be as book-larned as yourself mr grant but i take it being only a plain spoken englishman as i observed afore that one is to the full as like to find a raspberry in one's garden as in one's book mr grant grant observing that his neighbour spoke rather in a surly tone did not contradict him being well versed in the bible he knew that a soft word turneth away wrath and he answered in a good humoured voice i hear neighbour oakly you are likely to make a great deal of money of your nursery this year here's to the health of you and yours not forgetting the seedling larches which i see are coming on finely thank ye neighbour kindly the larches are coming on tolerably well that's certain and here's to your good health mr grant -- you and yours not forgetting your what dye call 'em raspberries -- drinks -- and after a pause resumes i'm not apt to be a beggar neighbour but if you could give me -- here mr oakly was interrupted by the entrance of some strangers and he did finish making his request -- mr oakly was not as he said of himself apt to ask favours and nothing but grant's cordiality could have conquered his prejudices so far as to tempt him to ask a favour from a scotchman he was going to have asked for some of the brobdingnag raspberry-plants the next day the thought of the raspberry-plants recurred to his memory but being a bashful man he did not like to go himself on purpose to make his request and he desired his wife who was just setting out to market to call at grant's gate and if he was at work in his garden to ask him for a few plants of his raspberries the answer which oakly's wife brought to him was that mr grant had not a raspberry-plant in the world to give him and that if he had ever so many he would not give one away except to his own son oakly flew into a passion when he received such a message declared it was just such a mean shabby trick as might have been expected from a scotchman -- called himself a booby a dupe and a blockhead for ever having trusted to the civil speeches of a scotchman -- swore that he would die in the parish workhouse before he would ever ask another favour be it ever so small from a scotchman related to his wife for the hundredth time the way in which he had been taken in by the scotch peddler ten years ago and concluded by forswearing all further intercourse with mr grant and all belonging to him son arthur said he addressing himself to the boy who just then came in from work -- son arthur do you hear me let me never again see you with grant's son with maurice father with maurice grant i say i forbid you from this day and hour forward to have anything to do with him oh why dear father ask no questions but do as i bid you arthur burst out a crying and only said yes father i'll do as you bid me to be sure why now what does the boy cry for is there no other boy simpleton think you to play with but this scotchman's son i'll find out another play-fellow for ye child if that be all that's not all father said arthur trying to stop himself from sobbing but the thing is i shall never have such another play-fellow - -i shall never have such another friend as maurice grant like father like son -- you may think yourself well off to have done with him done with him oh father and shall i never go again to work in his garden and may not he come to mine no replied oakly sturdily his father has used me uncivil and no man shall use me uncivil twice i say no wife sweep up this hearth boy don't take on like a fool but eat thy bacon and greens and let's hear no more of maurice grant arthur promised to obey his father he only begged that he might once more speak to maurice and tell him that it was by his father's orders he acted this request was granted but when arthur further begged to know what reason he might give for this separation his father refused to tell his reasons the two friends took leave of one another very sorrowfully mr grant when he heard of all this endeavoured to discover what could have offended his neighbour but all explanation was prevented by the obstinate silence of oakly now the message which grant really sent about the brobdingnag raspberries was somewhat different from that which mr oakly received the message was that the raspberries were not mr grant's that therefore he had no right to give them away that they belonged to his son maurice and that this was not the right time of year for planting them this message had been unluckily misunderstood grant gave his answer to his wife she to a welsh servant-girl who did not perfectly comprehend her mistress' broad scotch and she in her turn could not make herself intelligible to mrs oakly who hated the welsh accent and whose attention when the servant-girl delivered the message was principally engrossed by the management of her own horse the horse on which mrs oakly rode this day being ill-broken would not stand still quietly at the gate and she was extremely impatient to receive her answer and to ride on to market oakly when he had once resolved to dislike his neighbour grant could not long remain without finding out fresh causes of complaint there was in grant's garden a plum-tree which was planted close to the loose stone wall that divided the garden from the nursery the soil in which the plum tree was planted happened not to be quite so good as that which was on the opposite side of the wall and the plum-tree had forced its way through the wall and gradually had taken possession of the ground which it liked best oakly thought the plum-tree as it belonged to mr grant had no right to make its appearance on his ground an attorney told him that he might oblige grant to cut it down but mr grant refused to cut down his plum- tree at the attorney's desire and the attorney persuaded oakly to go to law about the business and the lawsuit went on for some months the attorney at the end of this time came to oakly with a demand for money to carry on his suit assuring him that in a short time it would be determined in his favour oakly paid his attorney ten golden guineas remarked that it was a great sum for him to pay and that nothing but the love of justice could make him persevere in this lawsuit about a bit of ground which after all said he is not worth twopence the plum- tree does me little or no damage but i don't like to be imposed upon by a scotchman the attorney saw and took advantage of oakly's prejudice against the natives of scotland and he persuaded him that to show the spirit of a true-born englishman it was necessary whatever it might cost him to persist in this law suit it was soon after this conversation with the attorney that mr oakly walked with resolute steps towards the plum-tree saying to himself if it cost me a hundred pounds i will not let this cunning scotchman get the better of me arthur interrupted his father's reverie by pointing to a book and some young plants which lay upon the wall i fancy father said he those things are for you for there is a little note directed to you in maurice's handwriting shall i bring it to you yes let me read it child since i must it contained these words dear mr oakly -- i don't know why you have quarrelled with us i am very sorry for it but though you are angry with me i am not angry with you i hope you will not refuse some of my brobdingnag raspberry-plants which you asked for a great while ago when we were all good friends it was not the right time of the year to plant them which was the reason they were not sent to you but it is just the right time to plant them now and i send you the book in which you will find the reason why we always put seaweed ashes about their roots and i have got some seaweed ashes for you you will find the ashes in the flower-pot upon the wall i have never spoken to arthur nor he to me since you bid us not so wishing your brobdingnag raspberries may turn out as well as ours and longing to be all friends again i am with love to dear arthur and self your affectionate neighbour's son maurice grant p s -- it is now about four months since the quarrel began and that is a very long while a great part of the effect of this letter was lost upon oakly because he was not very expert in reading writing and it cost him much trouble to spell it and put it together however he seemed affected by it and said i believe this maurice loves you well enough arthur and he seems a good sort of boy but as to the raspberries i believe all that he says about them is but an excuse and at anyrate as i could not get 'em when i asked for them i'll not have 'em now do you hear me i say arthur what are you reading there arthur was reading the page that was doubled down in the book which maurice had left along with the raspberry-plants upon the wall arthur read aloud as follows -- monthly magazine dec '98 p 421 there is a sort of strawberry cultivated at jersey which is almost covered with seaweed in the winter in like manner as many plants in england are with litter from the stable these strawberries are usually of the largeness of a middle-sized apricot and the flavour is particularly grateful in jersey and guernsey situate scarcely one degree farther south than cornwall all kinds of fruit pulse and vegetables are produced in their seasons a fortnight or three weeks sooner than in england even on the southern shores and snow will scarcely remain twenty-four hours on the earth although this may be attributed to these islands being surrounded with a salt and consequently a moist atmosphere yet the ashes seaweed ashes made use of as manure may also have their portion of influence it is necessary to observe that this experiment has never been actually tried upon raspberry-plants and here continued arthur is something written with a pencil on a slip of paper and it is maurice's writing i will read it to you 'when i read in this book what is said about the strawberries growing as large as apricots after they had been covered over with seaweed i thought that perhaps seaweed ashes might be good for my father's raspberries and i asked him if he would give me leave to try them he gave me leave and i went directly and gathered together some seaweed that had been cast on shore and i dried it and burned it and then i manured the raspberries with it and the year afterwards the raspberries grew to the size that you have seen now the reason i tell you this is first that you may know how to manage your raspberries and next because i remember you looked very grave as if you were not pleased with my father mr grant when he told you that the way by which he came by his brobdingnag raspberries was a secret perhaps this was the thing that has made you so angry with us all for you never have come to see father since that evening now i have told you all i know and so i hope you will not be angry with us any longer ' mr oakly was much pleased by this openness and said why now arthur this is something like this is telling one the thing one wants to know without fine speeches this is like an englishman more than a scotchman pray arthur do you know whether your friend maurice was born in england or in scotland no indeed sir i don't know -- i never asked -- i did not think it signified all i know is that wherever he was born he is very good look papa my tulip is blowing upon my word said his father this will be a beautiful tulip it was given to me by maurice and did you give him nothing for it was the father's inquiry nothing in the world and he gave it to me just at the time when he had good cause to be angry with me just when i had broken his bell-glass i have a great mind to let you play together again said arthur's father oh if you would cried arthur clapping his hands how happy we should be do you know father i have often sat for an hour at a time up in that crab-tree looking at maurice at work in his garden and wishing that i was at work with him here arthur was interrupted by the attorney who came to ask mr oakly some question about the lawsuit concerning the plum-tree oakly showed him maurice's letter and to arthur's extreme astonishment the attorney had no sooner read it than he exclaimed what an artful little gentleman this is i never in the course of all my practice met with anything better why this is the most cunning letter i ever read where's the cunning said oakly and he put on his spectacles my good sir don't you see that all this stuff about brobdingnag raspberries is to ward off your suit about the plum-tree they know -- that is mr grant who is sharp enough knows -- that he will be worsted in that suit that he must in short pay you a good round sum for damages if it goes on -- damages said oakly staring round him at the plum-tree but i don't know what you mean i mean nothing but what's honest i don't mean to ask for any good round sum for the plum-tree has done me no great harm by coming into my garden but only i don't choose it should come there without my leave well well said the attorney i understand all that but what i want to make you mr oakly understand is that this grant and his son only want to make up matters with you and prevent the thing's coming to a fair trial by sending on in this underhand sort of way a bribe of a few raspberries a bribe exclaimed oakly i never took a bribe and i never will and with sudden indignation he pulled the raspberry plants from the ground in which arthur was planting them and he threw them over the wall into grant's garden maurice had put his tulip which was beginning to blow in a flower-pot on the top of the wall in hopes that his friend arthur would see it from day to day alas he knew not in what a dangerous situation he had placed it one of his own brobdingnag raspberry-plants swung by the angry arm of oakly struck off the head of his precious tulip arthur who was full of the thought of convincing his father that the attorney was mistaken in his judgment of poor maurice did not observe the fall of the tulip the next day when maurice saw his raspberry-plants scattered upon the ground and his favourite tulip broken he was in much astonishment and for some moments angry but anger with him never lasted long he was convinced that all this must be owing to some accident or mistake he could not believe that anyone could be so malicious as to injure him on purpose -- and even if they did all this on purpose to vex me said he to himself the best thing i can do is not to let it vex me forgive and forget this temper of mind maurice was more happy in enjoying than he could have been made without it by the possession of all the tulips in holland tulips were at this time things of great consequence in the estimation of the country several miles round where maurice and arthur lived there was a florist's feast to be held at the neighbouring town at which a prize of a handsome set of gardening-tools was to be given to the person who could produce the finest flower of its kind a tulip was the flower which was thought the finest the preceding year and consequently numbers of people afterwards endeavoured to procure tulip-roots in hopes of obtaining the prize this year arthur's tulip was beautiful as he examined it from day to day and every day thought it improving he longed to thank his friend maurice for it and he often mounted into his crab-tree to look into maurice's garden in hopes of seeing his tulip also in full bloom and beauty he never could see it the day of the florist's feast arrived and oakly went with his son and the fine tulip to the place of meeting it was on a spacious bowling- green all the flowers of various sorts were ranged upon a terrace at the upper end of the bowling-green and amongst all this gay variety the tulip which maurice had given to arthur appeared conspicuously beautiful to the owner of this tulip the prize was adjudged and as the handsome garden-tools were delivered to arthur he heard a well known voice wish him joy he turned looked about him and saw his friend maurice but maurice where is your own tulip said mr oakly i thought arthur you told me that he kept one for himself so i did said maurice but somebody i suppose by accident broke it somebody who cried arthur and mr oakly at once somebody who threw the raspberry-plants back again over the wall replied maurice that was me -- that somebody was me said oakly i scorn to deny it but i did not intend to break your tulip maurice dear maurice said arthur -- you know i may call him dear maurice -- now you are by papa here are all the garden-tools take them and welcome not one of them said maurice drawing back offer them to the father -- offer them to mr grant whispered oakly he'll take them i'll answer for it mr oakly was mistaken the father would not accept of the tools mr oakly stood surprised -- certainly said he to himself this cannot be such a miser as i took him for and he walked immediately up to grant and bluntly said to him mr grant your son has behaved very handsomely to my son and you seem to be glad of it to be sure i am said grant which continued oakly gives me a better opinion of you than ever i had before -- i mean than ever i had since the day you sent me the shabby answer about those foolish what d'ye call em cursed raspberries what shabby answer said grant with surprise and oakly repeated exactly the message which he received and grant declared that he never sent any such message he repeated exactly the answer which he really sent and oakly immediately stretched out his hand to him saying i believe you no more need be said i'm only sorry i did not ask you about this four months ago and so i should have done if you had not been a scotchman till now i never rightly liked a scotchman we may thank this good little fellow continued he turning to maurice for our coming at last to a right understanding there was no holding out against his good nature i'm sure from the bottom of my heart i'm sorry i broke his tulip shake hands boys i'm glad to see you arthur look so happy again and hope mr grant will forgive -- oh forgive and forget said grant and his son at the same moment and from this time forward the two families lived in friendship with each other oakly laughed at his own folly in having been persuaded to go to law about the plum-tree and he in process of time so completely conquered his early prejudice against scotchmen that he and grant became partners in business mr grant's book-larning and knowledge of arithmetic he found highly useful to him and he on his side possessed a great many active good qualities which became serviceable to his partner the two boys rejoiced in this family union and arthur often declared that they owed all their happiness to maurice's favourite maxim forgive and forget waste not want not or two strings to your bow mr gresham a bristol merchant who had by honourable industry and economy accumulated a considerable fortune retired from business to a new house which he had built upon the downs near clifton mr gresham however did not imagine that a new house alone could make him happy he did not propose to live in idleness and extravagance for such a life would have been equally incompatible with his habits and his principles he was fond of children and as he had no sons he determined to adopt one of his relations he had two nephews and he invited both of them to his house that he might have an opportunity of judging of their dispositions and of the habits which they had acquired hal and benjamin mr gresham's nephews were about ten years old they had been educated very differently hal was the son of the elder branch of the family his father was a gentleman who spent rather more than he could afford and hal from the example of the servants in his father's family with whom he had passed the first years of his childhood learned to waste more of everything than he used he had been told that gentlemen should be above being careful and saving and he had unfortunately imbibed a notion that extravagance was the sign of a generous disposition and economy of an avaricious one benjamin on the contrary had been taught habits of care and foresight his father had but a very small fortune and was anxious that his son should early learn that economy ensures independence and sometimes puts it in the power of those who are not very rich to be very generous the morning after these two boys arrived at their uncle's they were eager to see all the rooms in the house mr gresham accompanied them and attended to their remarks and exclamations oh what an excellent motto exclaimed ben when he read the following words which were written in large characters over the chimney-piece in his uncle's spacious kitchen -- waste not want not 'waste not want not ' repeated his cousin hal in rather a contemptuous tone i think it looks stingy to servants and no gentleman's servants cooks especially would like to have such a mean motto always staring them in the face ben who was not so conversant as his cousin in the ways of cooks and gentlemen's servants made no reply to these observations mr gresham was called away whilst his nephews were looking at the other rooms in the house some time afterwards he heard their voices in the hall boys said he what are you doing there nothing sir said hal you were called away from us and we did not know which way to go and have you nothing to do said mr gresham no sir nothing answered hal in a careless tone like one who was well content with the state of habitual idleness no sir nothing replied ben in a voice of lamentation come said mr gresham if you have nothing to do lads will you unpack those two parcels for me the two parcels were exactly alike both of them well tied up with good whip cord ben took his parcel to a table and after breaking off the sealing wax began carefully to examine the knot and then to untie it hal stood still exactly in the spot where the parcel was put into his hands and tried first at one corner and then at another to pull the string off by force i wish these people wouldn't tie up their parcels so tight as if they were never to be undone cried he as he tugged at the cord and he pulled the knot closer instead of loosening it ben why how did you get yours undone man what's in your parcel -- i wonder what is in mine i wish i could get this string off -- i must cut it oh no said ben who now had undone the last knot of his parcel and who drew out the length of string with exultation don't cut it hal -- look what a nice cord this is and yours is the same it's a pity to cut it 'waste not want not ' you know pooh said hal what signifies a bit of packthread it is whip cord said ben well whip cord what signifies a bit of whip cord you can get a bit of whip cord twice as long as that for twopence and who cares for twopence not i for one so here it goes cried hal drawing out his knife and he cut the cord precipitately in sundry places lads have you undone the parcels for me said mr gresham opening the parlour door as he spoke yes sir cried hal and he dragged off his half cut half entangled string -- here's the parcel and here's my parcel uncle and here's the string said ben you may keep the string for your pains said mr gresham thank you sir said ben what an excellent whip cord it is and you hal continued mr gresham you may keep your string too if it will be of any use to you it will be of no use to me thank you sir said hal no i am afraid not if this be it said his uncle taking up the jagged knotted remains of hal's cord a few days after this mr gresham gave to each of his nephews a new top but how's this said hal these tops have no strings what shall we do for strings i have a string that will do very well for mine said ben and he pulled out of his pocket the fine long smooth string which had tied up the parcel with this he soon set up his top which spun admirably well oh how i wish i had but a string said hal what shall i do for a string i'll tell you what i can use the string that goes round my hat but then said ben what will you do for a hat-band i'll manage to do without one said hal and he took the string of his hat for his top it soon was worn through and he split his top by driving the pea too tightly into it his cousin ben let him set up his the next day but hal was not more fortunate or more careful when he meddled with other people's things than when he managed his own he had scarcely played half an hour before he split it by driving the peg too violently ben bore this misfortune with good humour come said he it can't be helped but give me the string because that may still be of use for something else it happened some time afterwards that a lady who had been intimately acquainted with hal's mother at bath -- that is to say who had frequently met her at the card-table during the winter -- now arrived at clifton she was informed by his mother that hal was at mr gresham's and her sons who were friends of his came to see him and invited him to spend the next day with them hal joyfully accepted the invitation he was always glad to go out to dine because it gave him something to do something to think of or at least something to say besides this he had been educated to think it was a fine thing to visit fine people and lady diana sweepstakes for that was the name of his mother's acquaintance was a very fine lady and her two sons intended to be very great gentlemen he was in a prodigious hurry when these young gentlemen knocked at his uncle's door the next day but just as he got to the hall door little patty called to him from the top of the stairs and told him that he had dropped his pocket- handkerchief pick it up then and bring it to me quick can't you child cried hal for lady di's sons are waiting for me little patty did not know anything about lady di's sons but as she was very good-natured and saw that her cousin hal was for some reason or other in a desperate hurry she ran downstairs as fast as she possibly could towards the landing-place where the handkerchief lay but alas before she reached the handkerchief she fell rolling down a whole flight of stairs and when her fall was at last stopped by the landing- place she did not cry out she writhed as if she was in great pain where are you hurt my love said mr gresham who came instantly on hearing the noise of someone falling downstairs where are you hurt my dear here papa said the little girl touching her ankle which she had decently covered with her gown i believe i am hurt here but not much added she trying to rise only it hurts me when i move i'll carry you don't move then said her father and he took her up in his arms my shoe i've lost one of my shoes said she ben looked for it upon the stairs and he found it sticking in a loop of whip cord which was entangled round one of the bannisters when this cord was drawn forth it appeared that it was the very same jagged entangled piece which hal had pulled off his parcel he had diverted himself with running up and downstairs whipping the bannisters with it as he thought he could convert it to no better use and with his usual carelessness he at last left it hanging just where he happened to throw it when the dinner bell rang poor little patty's ankle was terribly strained and hal reproached himself for his folly and would have reproached himself longer perhaps if lady di sweepstakes' sons had not hurried him away in the evening patty could not run about as she used to do but she sat upon the sofa and she said that she did not feel the pain of her ankle so much whilst ben was so good as to play at jack straws with her that's right ben never be ashamed of being good-natured to those who are younger and weaker than yourself said his uncle smiling at seeing him produce his whip cord to indulge his little cousin with a game at her favourite cat's cradle i shall not think you one bit less manly because i see you playing at cat's cradle with a little child of six years old hal however was not precisely of his uncle's opinion for when he returned in the evening and saw ben playing with his little cousin he could not help smiling contemptuously and asked if he had been playing at cat's cradle all night in a heedless manner he made some inquiries after patty's sprained ankle and then he ran on to tell all the news he had heard at lady diana sweepstakes' -- news which he thought would make him appear a person of vast importance do you know uncle -- do you know ben said he -- there's to be the most famous doings that ever were heard of upon the downs here the first day of next month which will be in a fortnight thank my stars i wish the fortnight was over i shall think of nothing else i know till that happy day comes mr gresham inquired why the first of september was to be so much happier than any other day in the year why replied hal lady diana sweepstakes you know is a famous rider and archer and all that -- very likely said mr gresham soberly but what then dear uncle cried hal but you shall hear there's to be a race upon the downs on the first of september and after the race there's to be an archery meeting for the ladies and lady diana sweepstakes is to be one of them and after the ladies have done shooting -- now ben comes the best part of it we boys are to have our turn and lady di is to give a prize to the best marksman amongst us of a very handsome bow and arrow do you know i've been practising already and i'll show you to-morrow as soon as it comes home the famous bow and arrow that lady diana has given me but perhaps added he with a scornful laugh you like a cat's cradle better than a bow and arrow ben made no reply to this taunt at the moment but the next day when hal's new bow and arrow came home he convinced him that he knew how to use it very well ben said his uncle you seem to be a good marksman though you have not boasted of yourself i'll give you a bow and arrow and perhaps if you practise you may make yourself an archer before the first of september and in the meantime you will not wish the fortnight to be over for you will have something to do oh sir interrupted hal but if you mean that ben should put in for the prize he must have a uniform why must he said mr gresham why sir because everybody has -- i mean everybody that's anybody and lady diana was talking about the uniform all dinner time and it's settled all about it except the buttons the young sweepstakes are to get theirs made first for patterns -- they are to be white faced with green and they'll look very handsome i'm sure and i shall write to mamma to-night as lady diana bid me about mine and i shall tell her to be sure to answer my letter without fail by return of post and then if mamma makes no objection which i know she won't because she never thinks much about expense and all that -- then i shall bespeak my uniform and get it made by the same tailor that makes for lady diana and the young sweepstakes mercy upon us said mr gresham who was almost stunned by the rapid vociferation with which this long speech about a uniform was pronounced i don't pretend to understand these things added he with an air of simplicity but we will inquire ben into the necessity of the case and if it is necessary -- or if you think it necessary that you shall have a uniform -- why i'll give you one you uncle will you indeed exclaimed hal with amazement painted in his countenance well that's the last thing in the world i should have expected you are not at all the sort of person i should have thought would care about a uniform and now i should have supposed you'd have thought it extravagant to have a coat on purpose only for one day and i'm sure lady diana sweepstakes thought as i do for when i told her of that motto over your kitchen chimney 'waste not want not ' she laughed and said that i had better not talk to you about uniforms and that my mother was the proper person to write to about my uniform but i'll tell lady diana uncle how good you are and how much she was mistaken take care how you do that said mr gresham for perhaps the lady was not mistaken nay did not you say just now you would give poor ben a uniform i said i would if he thought it necessary to have one oh i'll answer for it he'll think it necessary said hal laughing because it is necessary allow him at least to judge for himself said mr gresham my dear uncle but i assure you said hal earnestly there's no judging about the matter because really upon my word lady diana said distinctly that her sons were to have uniforms white faced with green and a green and white cockade in their hats may be so said mr gresham still with the same look of calm simplicity put on your hats boys and come with me i know a gentleman whose sons are to be at this archery meeting and we will inquire into all the particulars from him then after we have seen him it is not eleven o'clock yet we shall have time enough to walk on to bristol and choose the cloth for ben's uniform if it is necessary i cannot tell what to make of all he says whispered hal as he reached down his hat do you think ben he means to give you this uniform or not i think said ben that he means to give me one if it is necessary or as he said if i think it is necessary and that to be sure you will won't you or else you'll be a great fool i know after all i've told you how can anyone in the world know so much about the matter as i who have dined with lady diana sweepstakes but yesterday and heard all about it from beginning to end and as for this gentleman that we are going to i'm sure if he knows anything about the matter he'll say exactly the same as i do we shall hear said ben with a degree of composure which hal could by no means comprehend when a uniform was in question the gentleman upon whom mr gresham called had three sons who were all to be at this archery meeting and they unanimously assured him in the presence of hal and ben that they had never thought of buying uniforms for this grand occasion and that amongst the number of their acquaintance they knew of but three boys whose friends intended to be at such an unnecessary expense hal stood amazed such are the varieties of opinion upon all the grand affairs of life said mr gresham looking at his nephews what amongst one set of people you hear asserted to be absolutely necessary you will hear from another set of people is quite unnecessary all that can be done my dear boys in these difficult cases is to judge for yourselves which opinions and which people are the most reasonable hal who had been more accustomed to think of what was fashionable than of what was reasonable without at all considering the good sense of what his uncle said to him replied with childish petulance indeed sir i don't know what other people think but i only know what lady diana sweepstakes said the name of lady diana sweepstakes hal thought must impress all present with respect he was highly astonished when as he looked round he saw a smile of contempt upon everyone's countenance and he was yet further bewildered when he heard her spoken of as a very silly extravagant ridiculous woman whose opinion no prudent person would ask upon any subject and whose example was to be shunned instead of being imitated ay my dear hal said his uncle smiling at his look of amazement these are some of the things that young people must learn from experience all the world do not agree in opinion about characters you will hear the same person admired in one company and blamed in another so that we must still come round to the same point 'judge for yourself ' hal's thoughts were however at present too full of the uniform to allow his judgment to act with perfect impartiality as soon as their visit was over and all the time they walked down the hill from prince's building's towards bristol he continued to repeat nearly the same arguments which he had formerly used respecting necessity the uniform and lady diana sweepstakes to all this mr gresham made no reply and longer had the young gentleman expatiated upon the subject which had so strongly seized upon his imagination had not his senses been forcibly assailed at this instant by the delicious odours and tempting sight of certain cakes and jellies in a pastrycook's shop oh uncle said he as his uncle was going to turn the corner to pursue the road to bristol look at those jellies pointing to a confectioner's shop i must buy some of those good things for i have got some halfpence in my pocket your having halfpence in your pocket is an excellent reason for eating said mr gresham smiling but i really am hungry said hal you know uncle it is a good while since breakfast his uncle who was desirous to see his nephews act without restraint that he might judge their characters bid them do as they pleased come then ben if you've any halfpence in your pocket i'm not hungry said ben i suppose that means that you've no halfpence said hal laughing with the look of superiority which he had been taught to think the rich might assume towards those who were convicted either of poverty or economy waste not want not said ben to himself contrary to his cousin's surmise he happened to have two pennyworth of halfpence actually in his pocket at the very moment hal stepped into the pastrycook's shop a poor industrious man with a wooden leg who usually sweeps the dirty corner of the walk which turns at this spot to the wells held his hat to ben who after glancing his eye at the petitioner's well worn broom instantly produced his twopence i wish i had more halfpence for you my good man said he but i've only twopence hal came out of mr millar's the confectioner's shop with a hatful of cakes in his hand mr millar's dog was sitting on the flags before the door and he looked up with a wistful begging eye at hal who was eating a queen cake hal who was wasteful even in his good-nature threw a whole queen cake to the dog who swallowed it for a single mouthful there goes twopence in the form of a queen cake said mr gresham hal next offered some of his cakes to his uncle and cousin but they thanked him and refused to eat any because they said they were not hungry so he ate and ate as he walked along till at last he stopped and said this bun tastes so bad after the queen cakes i can't bear it and he was going to fling it from him into the river oh it is a pity to waste that good bun we may be glad of it yet said ben give it me rather than throw it away why i thought you said you were not hungry said hal true i am not hungry now but that is no reason why i should never be hungry again well there is the cake for you take it for it has made me sick and i don't care what becomes of it ben folded the refuse bit of his cousin's bun in a piece of paper and put it into his pocket i'm beginning to be exceeding tired or sick or something said hal and as there is a stand of coaches somewhere hereabouts had not we better take a coach instead of walking all the way to bristol for a stout archer said mr gresham you are more easily tired than one might have expected however with all my heart let us take a coach for ben asked me to show him the cathedral yesterday and i believe i should find it rather too much for me to walk so far though i am not sick with eating good things the cathedral said hal after he had been seated in the coach about a quarter of an hour and had somewhat recovered from his sickness -- the cathedral why are we only going to bristol to see the cathedral i thought we came out to see about a uniform there was a dulness and melancholy kind of stupidity in hal's countenance as he pronounced these words like one wakening from a dream which made both his uncle and his cousin burst out a-laughing why said hal who was now piqued i'm sure you did say uncle you would go to mr hall's to choose the cloth for the uniform very true and so i will said mr gresham but we need not make a whole morning's work need we of looking at a piece of cloth cannot we see a uniform and a cathedral both in one morning they went first to the cathedral hal's head was too full of the uniform to take any notice of the painted window which immediately caught ben's embarrassed attention he looked at the large stained figures on the gothic window and he observed their coloured shadows on the floor and walls mr gresham who perceived that he was eager on all subjects to gain information took this opportunity of telling him several things about the lost art of painting on glass gothic arches etc which hal thought extremely tiresome come come we shall be late indeed said hal surely you've looked long enough ben at this blue and red window i'm only thinking about these coloured shadows said ben i can show you when we go home ben said his uncle an entertaining paper upon such shadows vide priestley's history of vision chapter on coloured shadows hark cried ben did you hear that noise they all listened and they heard a bird singing in the cathedral it's our old robin sir said the lad who had opened the cathedral door for them yes said mr gresham there he is boys -- look -- perched upon the organ he often sits there and sings whilst the organ is playing and continued the lad who showed the cathedral he has lived here these many many winters they say he is fifteen years old and he is so tame poor fellow that if i had a bit of bread he'd come down and feed in my hand i've a bit of bun here cried ben joyfully producing the remains of the bun which hal but an hour before would have thrown away pray let us see the poor robin eat out of your hand the lad crumbled the bun and called to the robin who fluttered and chirped and seemed rejoiced at the sight of the bread but yet he did not come down from his pinnacle on the organ he is afraid of us said ben he is not used to eat before strangers i suppose ah no sir said the young man with a deep sigh that is not the thing he is used enough to eat afore company time was he'd have come down for me before ever so many fine folks and have eat his crumbs out of my hand at my first call but poor fellow it's not his fault now he does not know me now sir since my accident because of this great black patch the young man put his hand to his right eye which was covered with a huge black patch ben asked what accident he meant and the lad told him that but a few weeks ago he had lost the sight of his eye by the stroke of a stone which reached him as he was passing under the rocks at clifton unluckily when the workmen were blasting i don't mind so much for myself sir said the lad but i can't work so well now as i used to do before my accident for my old mother who has had a stroke of the palsy and i've a many little brothers and sisters not well able yet to get their own livelihood though they be as willing as willing can be where does your mother live said mr gresham hard by sir just close to the church here it was her that always had the showing of it to strangers till she lost the use of her poor limbs shall we may we uncle go that way this is the house is not it said ben when they went out of the cathedral they went into the house it was rather a hovel than a house but poor as it was it was as neat as misery could make it the old woman was sitting up in her wretched bed winding worsted four meagre ill- clothed pale children were all busy some of them sticking pins in paper for the pin-maker and others sorting rags for the paper-maker what a horrid place it is said hal sighing i did not know there were such shocking places in the world i've often seen terrible- looking tumble-down places as we drove through the town in mamma's carriage but then i did not know who lived in them and i never saw the inside of any of them it is very dreadful indeed to think that people are forced to live in this way i wish mamma would send me some more pocket-money that i might do something for them i had half a crown but continued he feeling in his pockets i'm afraid i spent the last shilling of it this morning upon those cakes that made me sick i wish i had my shilling now i'd give it to these poor people ben though he was all this time silent was as sorry as his talkative cousin for all these poor people but there was some difference between the sorrow of these two boys hal after he was again seated in the hackney-coach and had rattled through the busy streets of bristol for a few minutes quite forgot the spectacle of misery which he had seen and the gay shops in wine street and the idea of his green and white uniform wholly occupied his imagination now for our uniforms cried he as he jumped eagerly out of the coach when his uncle stopped at the woollen-draper's door uncle said ben stopping mr gresham before he got out of the carriage i don't think a uniform is at all necessary for me i'm very much obliged to you but i would rather not have one i have a very good coat and i think it would be waste well let me get out of the carriage and we will see about it said mr gresham perhaps the sight of the beautiful green and white cloth and the epaulettes have you ever considered the epaulettes may tempt you to change your mind oh no said ben laughing i shall not change my mind the green cloth and the white cloth and the epaulettes were produced to hal's infinite satisfaction his uncle took up a pen and calculated for a few minutes then showing the back of the letter upon which he was writing to his nephews cast up these sums boys said he and tell me whether i am right ben do you do it said hal a little embarrassed i am not quick at figures ben was and he went over his uncle's calculation very expeditiously it is right is it said mr gresham yes sir quite right then by this calculation i find i could for less than half the money your uniforms would cost purchase for each of you boys a warm great- coat which you will want i have a notion this winter upon the downs oh sir said hal with an alarmed look but it is not winter yet it is not cold weather yet we sha'n't want greatcoats yet don't you remember how cold we were hal the day before yesterday in that sharp wind when we were flying our kite upon the downs and winter will come though it is not come yet -- i am sure i should like to have a good warm great-coat very much mr gresham took six guineas out of his purse and he placed three of them before hal and three before ben young gentlemen said he i believe your uniforms would come to about three guineas a piece now i will lay out this money for you just as you please hal what say you why sir said hal a great-coat is a good thing to be sure and then after the great-coat as you said it would only cost half as much as the uniform there would be some money to spare would not there yes my dear about five-and-twenty shillings five-and-twenty shillings -- i could buy and do a great many things to be sure with five-and-twenty shillings but then the thing is i must go without the uniform if i have the great-coat certainly said his uncle ah said hal sighing as he looked at the epaulettes uncle if you would not be displeased if i choose the uniform -- i shall not be displeased at your choosing whatever you like best said mr gresham well then thank you sir said hal i think i had better have the uniform because if i have not the uniform now directly it will be of no use to me as the archery meeting is the week after next you know and as to the great-coat perhaps between this time and the very cold weather which perhaps won't be till christmas papa will buy a great- coat for me and i'll ask mamma to give me some pocket money to give away and she will perhaps to all this conclusive conditional reasoning which depended upon the word perhaps three times repeated mr gresham made no reply but he immediately bought the uniform for hal and desired that it should be sent to lady diana sweepstakes' son's tailor to be made up the measure of hal's happiness was now complete and how am i to lay out the three guineas for you ben said mr gresham speak what do you wish for first a great-coat uncle if you please gresham bought the coat and after it was paid for five-and-twenty shillings of ben's three guineas remained what next my boy said his uncle arrows uncle if you please three arrows my dear i promised you a bow and arrows no uncle you only said a bow well i meant a bow and arrows i'm glad you are so exact however it is better to claim less than more than what is promised the three arrows you shall have but go on how shall i dispose of these five-and- twenty shillings for you in clothes if you will be so good uncle for that poor boy who has the great black patch on his eye i always believed said mr gresham shaking hands with ben that economy and generosity were the best friends instead of being enemies as some silly extravagant people would have us think them choose the poor blind boy's coat my dear nephew and pay for it there's no occasion for my praising you about the matter your best reward is in your own mind child and you want no other or i'm mistaken now jump into the coach boys and let's be off we shall be late i'm afraid continued he as the coach drove on but i must let you stop ben with your goods at the poor boy's door when they came to the house mr gresham opened the coach door and ben jumped out with his parcel under his arm stay stay you must take me with you said his pleased uncle i like to see people made happy as well as you do and so do i too said hal let me come with you i almost wish my uniform was not gone to the tailor's so i do and when he saw the look of delight and gratitude with which the poor boy received the clothes which ben gave him and when he heard the mother and children thank him he sighed and said well i hope mamma will give me some more pocket money soon upon his return home however the sight of the famous bow and arrow which lady diana sweepstakes had sent him recalled to his imagination all the joys of his green and white uniform and he no longer wished that it had not been sent to the tailor's but i don't understand cousin hal said little patty why you call this bow a famous bow you say famous very often and i don't know exactly what it means a famous uniform -- famous doings i remember you said there are to be famous doings the first of september upon the downs what does famous mean oh why famous means -- now don't you know what famous means it means- -it is a word that people say -- it is the fashion to say it -- it means -- it means famous patty laughed and said this does not explain it to me no said hal nor can it be explained if you don't understand it that's not my fault everybody but little children i suppose understands it but there's no explaining those sort of words if you don't take them at once there's to be famous doings upon the downs the first of september that is grand fine in short what does it signify talking any longer patty about the matter give me my bow for i must go out upon the downs and practise ben accompanied him with the bow and the three arrows which his uncle had now given to him and every day these two boys went out upon the downs and practised shooting with indefatigable perseverance where equal pains are taken success is usually found to be pretty nearly equal our two archers by constant practice became expert marksmen and before the day of trial they were so exactly matched in point of dexterity that it was scarcely possible to decide which was superior the long expected lst of september at length arrived what sort of a day is it was the first question that was asked by hal and ben the moment that they wakened the sun shone bright but there was a sharp and high wind ha said ben i shall be glad of my good great-coat to-day for i've a notion it will be rather cold upon the downs especially when we are standing still as we must whilst all the people are shooting oh never mind i don't think i shall feel it cold at all said hal as he dressed himself in his new green and white uniform and he viewed himself with much complacency good morning to you uncle how do you do said he in a voice of exultation when he entered the breakfast-room how do you do seemed rather to mean how do you like me in my uniform and his uncle's cool very well i thank you hal disappointed him as it seemed only to say your uniform makes no difference in my opinion of you even little patty went on eating her breakfast much as usual and talked of the pleasure of walking with her father to the downs and of all the little things which interested her so that hal's epaulettes were not the principal object in anyone's imagination but his own papa said patty as we go up the hill where there is so much red mud i must take care to pick my way nicely and i must hold up my frock as you desired me and perhaps you will be so good if i am not troublesome to lift me over the very bad place where are no stepping- stones my ankle is entirely well and i'm glad of that or else i should not be able to walk so far as the downs how good you were to me ben when i was in pain the day i sprained my ankle you played at jack straws and at cat's-cradle with me oh that puts me in mind -- here are your gloves which i asked you that night to let me mend i've been a great while about them but are not they not very neatly mended papa look at the sewing i am not a very good judge of sewing my dear little girl said mr gresham examining the work with a close and scrupulous eye but in my opinion here is one stitch that is rather too long the white teeth are not quite even oh papa i'll take out that long tooth in a minute said patty laughing i did not think that you would observe it so soon i would not have you trust to my blindness said her father stroking her head fondly i observe everything i observe for instance that you are a grateful little girl and that you are glad to be of use to those who have been kind to you and for this i forgive you the long stitch but it's out it's out papa said patty and the next time your gloves want mending ben i'll mend them better they are very nice i think said ben drawing them on and i am much obliged to you i was just wishing i had a pair of gloves to keep my fingers warm to-day for i never can shoot well when my hands are benumbed look hal you know how ragged these gloves were you said they were good for nothing but to throw away now look there's not a hole in them said he spreading his fingers now is it not very extraordinary said hal to himself that they should go on so long talking about an old pair of gloves without saying scarcely a word about my new uniform well the young sweepstakes and lady diana will talk enough about it that's one comfort is not it time to think of setting out sir said hal to his uncle the company you know are to meet at the ostrich at twelve and the race to begin at one and lady diana's horses i know were ordered to be at the door at ten mr stephen the butler here interrupted the hurrying young gentleman in his calculations there's a poor lad sir below with a great black patch on his right eye who is come from bristol and wants to speak a word with the young gentlemen if you please i told him they were just going out with you but he says he won't detain them more than half a minute show him up show him up said mr gresham but i suppose said hal with a sigh that stephen mistook when he said the young gentlemen he only wants to see ben i daresay i'm sure he has no reason to want to see me here he comes -- oh ben he is dressed in the new coat you gave him whispered hal who was really a good-natured boy though extravagant how much better he looks than he did in the ragged coat ah he looked at you first ben -- and well he may the boy bowed without any cringing servility but with an open decent freedom in his manner which expressed that he had been obliged but that he knew his young benefactor was not thinking of the obligation he made as little distinction as possible between his bows to the two cousins as i was sent with a message by the clerk of our parish to redland chapel out on the downs to-day sir said he to mr gresham knowing your house lay in my way my mother sir bid me call and make bold to offer the young gentlemen two little worsted balls that she has worked for them continued the lad pulling out of his pocket two worsted balls worked in green and orange-coloured stripes they are but poor things sir she bid me say to look at but considering she has but one hand to work with and that her left hand you'll not despise 'em we hopes he held the balls to ben and hal they are both alike gentlemen said he if you'll be pleased to take 'em they're better than they look for they bound higher than your head i cut the cork round for the inside myself which was all i could do they are nice balls indeed we are much obliged to you said the boys as they received them and they proved them immediately the balls struck the floor with a delightful sound and rebounded higher than mr gresham's head little patty clapped her hands joyfully but now a thundering double rap at the door was heard the master sweepstakes sir said stephen are come for master hal they say that all the young gentlemen who have archery uniforms are to walk together in a body i think they say sir and they are to parade along the well walk they desired me to say sir with a drum and fife and so up the hill by prince's place and all to go upon the downs together to the place of meeting i am not sure i'm right sir for both the young gentlemen spoke at once and the wind is very high at the street door so that i could not well make out all they said but i believe this is the sense of it yes yes said hal eagerly it's all right i know that is just what was settled the day i dined at lady diana's and lady diana and a great party of gentlemen are to ride -- well that is nothing to the purpose interrupted mr gresham don't keep these master sweepstakes waiting decide -- do you choose to go with them or with us sir -- uncle -- sir you know since all the uniforms agreed to go together- - off with you then mr uniform if you mean to go said mr gresham hal ran downstairs in such a hurry that he forgot his bow and arrows ben discovered this when he went to fetch his own and the lad from bristol who had been ordered by mr gresham to eat his breakfast before he proceeded to redland chapel heard ben talking about his cousin's bow and arrows i know said ben he will be sorry not to have his bow with him because here are the green knots tied to it to match his cockade and he said that the boys were all to carry their bows as part of the show if you'll give me leave sir said the poor bristol lad i shall have plenty of time and i'll run down to the well walk after the young gentleman and take him his bow and arrows will you i shall be much obliged to you said ben and away went the boy with the bow that was ornamented with green ribands the public walk leading to the wells was full of company the windows of all the houses in st vincent's parade were crowded with well dressed ladies who were looking out in expectation of the archery procession parties of gentlemen and ladies and a motley crowd of spectators were seen moving backwards and forwards under the rocks on the opposite side of the water a barge with coloured streamers flying was waiting to take up a party who were going upon the water the bargemen rested upon their oars and gazed with broad faces of curiosity upon the busy scene that appeared upon the public walk the archers and archeresses were now drawn up on the flags under the semicircular piazza just before mrs yearsley's library a little band of children who had been mustered by lady diana sweepstakes' spirited exertions closed the procession they were now all in readiness the drummer only waited for her ladyship's signal and the archers' corps only waited for her ladyship's word of command to march where are your bow and arrows my little man said her ladyship to hal as she reviewed her lilliputian regiment you can't march man without your arms hal had despatched a messenger for his forgotten bow but the messenger returned not he looked from side to side in great distress -- oh there's my bow coming i declare cried he look i see the bow and the ribands look now between the trees charles sweepstakes on the hotwell walk it is coming but you've kept us all waiting a confounded time said his impatient friend it is that good-natured poor fellow from bristol i protest that has brought it me i'm sure i don't deserve it from him said hal to himself when he saw the lad with the black patch on his eye running quite out of breath towards him with his bow and arrows fall back my good friend -- fall back said the military lady as soon as he had delivered the bow to hal i mean stand out of the way for your great patch cuts no figure amongst us don't follow so close now as if you belonged to us pray the poor boy had no ambition to partake the triumph he fell back as soon as he understood the meaning of the lady's words the drum beat the fife played the archers marched the spectators admired hal stepped proudly and felt as if the eyes of the whole universe were upon his epaulettes or upon the facings of his uniform whilst all the time he was considered only as part of a show the walk appeared much shorter than usual and he was extremely sorry that lady diana when they were half-way up the hill leading to prince's place mounted her horse because the road was dirty and all the gentlemen and ladies who accompanied her followed her example we can leave the children to walk you know said she to the gentleman who helped her to mount her horse i must call to some of them though and leave orders where they are to join she beckoned and hal who was foremost and proud to show his alacrity ran on to receive her ladyship's orders now as we have before observed it was a sharp and windy day and though lady diana sweepstakes was actually speaking to him and looking at him he could not prevent his nose from wanting to be blowed he pulled out his handkerchief and out rolled the new ball which had been given to him just before he left home and which according to his usual careless habits he had stuffed into his pockets in his hurry oh my new ball cried he as he ran after it as he stopped to pick it up he let go his hat which he had hitherto held on with anxious care for the hat though it had a fine green and white cockade had no band or string round it the string as we may recollect our wasteful hero had used in spinning his top the hat was too large for his head without this band a sudden gust of wind blew it off lady diana's horse started and reared she was a famous horse woman and sat him to the admiration of all beholders but there was a puddle of red clay and water in this spot and her ladyship's uniform habit was a sufferer by the accident careless brat said she why can't he keep his hat upon his head in the meantime the wind blew the hat down the hill and hal ran after it amidst the laughter of his kind friends the young sweepstakes and the rest of the little regiment the hat was lodged at length upon a bank hal pursued it he thought this bank was hard but alas the moment he set his foot upon it the foot sank he tried to draw it back his other foot slipped and he fell prostrate in his green and white uniform into the treacherous bed of red mud his companions who had halted upon the top of the hill stood laughing spectators of his misfortune it happened that the poor boy with the black patch upon his eye who had been ordered by lady diana to fall back and to keep at a distance was now coming up the hill and the moment he saw our fallen hero he hastened to his assistance he dragged poor hal who was a deplorable spectacle out of the red mud the obliging mistress of a lodging house as soon as she understood that the young gentleman was nephew to mr gresham to whom she had formerly let her house received hal covered as he was with dirt the poor bristol lad hastened to mr gresham's for clean stockings and shoes for hal he was unwilling to give up his uniform it was rubbed and rubbed and a spot here and there was washed out and he kept continually repeating -- when it's dry it will all brush off -- when it's dry it will all brush off won't it but soon the fear of being too late at the archery meeting began to balance the dread of appearing in his stained habiliments and he now as anxiously repeated whilst the woman held the wet coat to the fire oh i shall be too late indeed i shall be too late make haste it will never dry hold it nearer -- nearer to the fire i shall lose my turn to shoot oh give me the coat i don't mind how it is if i can but get it on holding it nearer and nearer to the fire dried it quickly to be sure but it shrunk it also so that it was no easy matter to get the coat on again however hal who did not see the red splashes which in spite of all these operations were too visible upon his shoulders and upon the skirts of his white coat behind was pretty well satisfied to observe that there was not one spot upon the facings nobody said he will take notice of my coat behind i daresay i think it looks as smart almost as ever -- and under this persuasion our young archer resumed his bow -- his bow with green ribands now no more -- and he pursued his way to the downs all his companions were far out of sight i suppose said he to his friend with the black patch -- i suppose my uncle and ben had left home before you went for the shoes and stockings for me oh yes sir the butler said they had been gone to the downs a matter of a good half-hour or more hal trudged on as fast as he possibly could when he got upon the downs he saw numbers of carriages and crowds of people all going towards the place of meeting at the ostrich he pressed forwards he was at first so much afraid of being late that he did not take notice of the mirth his motley appearance excited in all beholders at length he reached the appointed spot there was a great crowd of people in the midst he heard lady diana's loud voice betting upon someone who was just going to shoot at the mark so then the shooting is begun is it said hal oh let me in pray let me into the circle i'm one of the archers -- i am indeed don't you see my green and white uniform your red and white uniform you mean said the man to whom he addressed himself and the people as they opened a passage for him could not refrain laughing at the mixture of dirt and finery which it exhibited in vain when he got into the midst of the formidable circle he looked to his friends the young sweepstakes for their countenance and support they were amongst the most unmerciful of the laughers lady diana also seemed more to enjoy than to pity his confusion why could you not keep your hat upon your head man said she in her masculine tone you have been almost the ruin of my poor uniform habit but i've escaped rather better than you have don't stand there in the middle of the circle or you'll have an arrow in your eyes just now i've a notion hal looked round in search of better friends oh where's my uncle -- where's ben said he he was in such confusion that amongst the number of faces he could scarcely distinguish one from another but he felt somebody at this moment pull his elbow and to his great relief he heard the friendly voice and saw the good natured face of his cousin ben come back come behind these people said ben and put on my great- coat here it is for you right glad was hal to cover his disgraced uniform with the rough great- coat which he had formerly despised he pulled the stained drooping cockade out of his unfortunate hat and he was now sufficiently recovered from his vexation to give an intelligible account of his accident to his uncle and patty who anxiously inquired what had detained him so long and what had been the matter in the midst of the history of his disaster he was just proving to patty that his taking the hatband to spin his top had nothing to do with his misfortune and he was at the same time endeavouring to refute his uncle's opinion that the waste of the whipcord that tied the parcel was the original cause of all his evils when he was summoned to try his skill with his famous bow my hands are benumbed i can scarcely feel said he rubbing them and blowing upon the ends of his fingers come come cried young sweepstakes i'm within one inch of the mark who'll go nearer i shall like to see shoot away hal but first understand our laws we settled them before you came upon the green you are to have three shots with your own bow and your own arrows and nobody's to borrow or lend under pretence of other's bows being better or worse or under any pretence do you hear hal this young gentleman had good reasons for being so strict in these laws as he had observed that none of his companions had such an excellent bow as he had provided for himself some of the boys had forgotten to bring more than one arrow with them and by his cunning regulation that each person should shoot with their own arrows many had lost one or two of their shots you are a lucky fellow you have your three arrows said young sweepstakes come we can't wait whilst you rub your fingers man -- shoot away hal was rather surprised at the asperity with which his friend spoke he little knew how easily acquaintance who call themselves friends can change when their interest comes in the slightest degree in competition with their friendship hurried by his impatient rival and with his hands so much benumbed that he could scarcely feel how to fix the arrow in the string he drew the bow the arrow was within a quarter of an inch of master sweepstakes' mark which was the nearest that had yet been hit hal seized his second arrow if i have any luck -- said he but just as he pronounced the word luck and as he bent his bow the string broke in two and the bow fell from his hands there it's all over with you cried master sweepstakes with a triumphant laugh here's my bow for him and welcome said ben no no sir said master sweepstakes that is not fair that's against the regulation you may shoot with your own bow if you choose it or you may not just as you think proper but you must not lend it sir it was now ben's turn to make his trial his first arrow was not successful his second was exactly as near as hal's first you have but one more said master sweepstakes -- now for it ben before he ventured his last arrow prudently examined the string of his bow and as he pulled it to try its strength it cracked master sweepstakes clapped his hands with loud exultations and insulting laughter but his laughter ceased when our provident hero calmly drew from his pocket an excellent piece of whip cord the everlasting whip cord i declare exclaimed hal when he saw that it was the very same that had tied up the parcel yes said ben as he fastened it to his bow i put it into my pocket to-day on purpose because i thought i might happen to want it he drew his bow the third and last time oh papa cried little patty as his arrow hit the mark it's the nearest is it not the nearest master sweepstakes with anxiety examined the hit there could be no doubt ben was victorious the bow the prize bow was now delivered to him and hal as he looked at the whip-cord exclaimed how lucky this whip-cord has been to you ben it is lucky perhaps you mean that he took care of it said mr gresham ay said hal very true he might well say 'waste not want not ' it is a good thing to have two strings to one's bow old poz lucy daughter to the justice mrs bustle landlady of the saracen's head justice headstrong old man william a servant scene i the house of justice headstrong -- a hall -- lucy

story after dinner after they go out the justice stops tell this story -- i don't know whether it tells well for me but i'll never be positive any more -- that's poz the mimic chapter i mr and mrs montague spent the summer of the year 1795 at clifton with their son frederick and their two daughters sophia and marianne they had taken much care of the education of their children nor were they ever tempted by any motive of personal convenience or temporary amusement to hazard the permanent happiness of their pupils sensible of the extreme importance of early impressions and of the powerful influence of external circumstances in forming the characters and the manners they were now anxious that the variety of new ideas and new objects which would strike the minds of their children should appear in a just point of view let children see and judge for themselves is often inconsiderately said where children see only a part they cannot judge of the whole and from the superficial view which they can have in short visits and desultory conversation they can form only a false estimate of the objects of human happiness a false notion of the nature of society and false opinions of characters for the above reasons mr and mrs montague were particularly cautious in the choice of their acquaintances as they were well aware that whatever passed in conversation before children became part of their education when they came to clifton they wished to have a house entirely to themselves but as they came late in the season almost all the lodging houses were full and for a few weeks they were obliged to remain in a house where some of the apartments were already occupied during the first fortnight they scarcely saw or heard anything of one of the families who lodged on the same floor with them an elderly quaker and his sister bertha were their silent neighbours the blooming complexion of the lady had indeed attracted the attention of the children as they caught a glimpse of her face when she was getting into her carriage to go out upon the downs they could scarcely believe that she came to the wells on account of her health besides her blooming complexion the delicate white of her garments had struck them with admiration and they observed that her brother carefully guarded her dress from the wheel of the carriage as he handed her in from this circumstance and from the benevolent countenance of the old gentleman they concluded that he was very fond of his sister and that they were certainly very happy except that they never spoke and could be seen only for a moment not so the maiden lady who occupied the ground floor on the stairs in the passages at her window she was continually visible and she appeared to possess the art of being present in all these places at once her voice was eternally to be heard and it was not particularly melodious the very first day she met mrs montague's children on the stairs she stopped to tell marianne that she was a charming dear and a charming little dear to kiss her to inquire her name and to inform her that her own name was mrs theresa tattle a circumstance of which there was little danger of their long remaining in ignorance for in the course of one morning at least twenty single and as many double raps at the door were succeeded by vociferations of mrs theresa tattle's servant mrs theresa tattle at home mrs theresa tattle not at home no person at the wells was oftener at home and abroad than mrs tattle she had as she deemed it the happiness to have a most extensive acquaintance residing at clifton she had for years kept a register of arrivals she regularly consulted the subscriptions to the circulating libraries and the lists at the ball and the pump-rooms so that with a memory unencumbered with literature and free from all domestic cares she contrived to retain a most astonishing and correct list of births deaths and marriages together with all the anecdotes amusing instructive or scandalous which are necessary to the conversation of a water drinking place and essential to the character of a very pleasant woman a very pleasant woman mrs tattle was usually called and conscious of her accomplishments she was eager to introduce herself to the acquaintance of her new neighbours having with her ordinary expedition collected from their servants by means of her own all that could be known or rather all that could be told about them the name of montague at all events she knew was a good name and justified in courting the acquaintance she courted it first by nods and becks and smiles at marianne whenever she met her and marianne who was a very little girl began presently to nod and smile in return persuaded that a lady who smiled so much could not be ill-natured besides mrs theresa's parlour door was sometimes left more than half open to afford a view of a green parrot marianne sometimes passed very slowly by this door one morning it was left quite wide open when she stopped to say pretty poll and immediately mrs tattle begged she would do her the honour to walk in and see pretty poll at the same time taking the liberty to offer her a piece of iced plum-cake the next day mrs theresa tattle did herself the honour to wait upon mrs montague to apologize for the liberty she taken in inviting mrs montague's charming miss marianne into her apartment to see pretty poll and for the still greater liberty she had taken in offering her a piece of plum-cake -- inconsiderate creature that she was -- which might possibly have disagreed with her and which certainly were liberties she never should have been induced to take if she had not been unaccountably bewitched by miss marianne's striking though highly flattering resemblance to a young gentleman an officer with whom she had danced now nearly twelve years ago of the name of montague a most respectable young man and of a most respectable family with which in a remote degree she might presume to say she herself was someway connected having the honour to be nearly related to the joneses of merionethshire who were cousins to the mainwarings of bedfordshire who married into the family of the griffiths the eldest branch of which she understood had the honour to be cousin-german to mr montague on which account she had been impatient to pay a visit so likely to be productive of most agreeable consequences by the acquisition of an acquaintance whose society must do her infinite honour having thus happily accomplished her first visit there seemed little probability of escaping mrs tattle's further acquaintance in the course of the first week she only hinted to mr montague that some people thought his system of education rather odd that she should be obliged to him if he would some time or other when he had nothing else to do just sit down and make her understand his notions that she might have something to say to her acquaintance as she always wished to have when she heard any friend attacked or any friend's opinions mr montague declining to sit down and make this lady understand a system of education only to give her something to say and showing unaccountable indifference about the attacks with which he was threatened mrs tattle next addressed herself to mrs montague prophesying in a most serious whisper that the charming miss marianne would shortly and inevitably grow quite crooked if she were not immediately provided with a back- board a french dancing-master and a pair of stocks this alarming whisper could not however have a permanent effect upon mrs montague's understanding because three days afterwards mrs theresa upon the most anxious inspection entirely mistook the just and natural proportions of the hip and shoulder this danger vanishing mrs tattle presently with a rueful length of face and formal preface hesitated to assure mrs montague that she was greatly distressed about her daughter sophy that she was convinced her lungs were affected and that she certainly ought to drink the waters morning and evening and above all things must keep one of the patirosa lozenges constantly in her mouth and directly consult dr cardamum the best physician in the world and the person she would send for herself upon her death-bed because to her certain knowledge he had recovered a young lady a relation of her own after she had lost one whole globe of her lungs lobe the medical opinion of a lady of so much anatomical precision could not have much weight neither was this universal adviser more successful in an attempt to introduce a tutor to frederick who she apprehended must want some one to perfect him in the latin and greek and dead languages of which she observed it would be impertinent for a woman to talk only she might venture to repeat what she had heard said by good authority that a competency of the dead tongues could be had nowhere but at a public school or else from a private tutor who had been abroad after the advantage of a classical education finished in one of the universities with a good family without which introduction it was idle to think of reaping solid advantages from any continental tour all which requisites from personal knowledge she could aver to be concentrated in the gentleman she had the honour to recommend as having been tutor to a young nobleman who had now no further occasion for him having unfortunately for himself and his family been killed in an untimely duel all mrs theresa tattle's suggestions being lost upon these stoical parents her powers were next tried upon the children and her success soon became apparent on sophy indeed she could not make any impression though she had expended on her some of her finest strokes of flattery sophy though very desirous of the approbation of her friends was not very desirous of winning the favour of strangers she was about thirteen -- that dangerous age at which ill educated girls in their anxiety to display their accomplishments are apt to become dependent for applause upon the praise of every idle visitor when the habits not being formed and the attention being suddenly turned to dress and manners girls are apt to affect and imitate indiscriminately everything that they conceive to be agreeable sophy whose taste had been cultivated at the same time with her powers of reasoning was not liable to fall into these errors she found that she could please those whom she wished to please without affecting to be anything but what she really was and her friends listened to what she said though she never repeated the sentiments or adopted the phrases which she might easily have copied from the conversation of those who were older or more fashionable than herself this word fashionable mrs theresa tattle knew had usually a great effect even at thirteen but she had not observed that it had much power upon sophy nor were her remarks concerning grace and manners much attended to her mother had taught sophy that it was best to let herself alone and not to distort either her person or her mind in acquiring grimace which nothing but the fashion of the moment can support and which is always detected and despised by people of real good sense and politeness bless me said mrs tattle to herself if i had such a tall daughter and so unformed before my eyes from morning to night it would certainly break my poor heart thank heaven i am not a mother if i were miss marianne for me miss marianne had heard so often from mrs tattle that she was very charming that she could not help believing it and from being a very pleasing unaffected little girl she in a short time grew so conceited that she could neither speak look nor be silent without imagining that everybody was or ought to be looking at her and when mrs theresa saw that mrs montague looked very grave upon these occasions she to repair the ill she had done would say after praising marianne's hair or her eyes oh but little ladies should never think about their beauty you know nobody loves anybody for being handsome but for being good people must think children are very silly or else they can never have reflected upon the nature of belief in their own minds if they imagine that children will believe the words that are said to them by way of moral when the countenance manner and every concomitant circumstance tell them a different tale children are excellent physiognomists -- they quickly learn the universal language of looks and what is said of them always makes a greater impression than what is said to them a truth of which those prudent people surely cannot be aware who comfort themselves and apologize to parents by saying oh but i would not say so and so to the child mrs theresa had seldom said to frederick montague that he had a vast deal of drollery and was a most incomparable mimic but she had said so of him in whispers which magnified the sound to his imagination if not to his ear he was a boy of much vivacity and had considerable abilities but his appetite for vulgar praise had not yet been surfeited even mrs theresa tattle's flattery pleased him and he exerted himself for her entertainment so much that he became quite a buffoon instead of observing characters and manners that he might judge of them and form his own he now watched every person he saw that he might detect some foible or catch some singularity in their gesture or pronunciation which he might successfully mimic alarmed by the rapid progress of these evils mr and mrs montague who from the first day that they had been honoured with mrs tattle's visit had begun to look out for new lodgings were now extremely impatient to decamp they were not people who from the weak fear of offending a silly acquaintance would hazard the happiness of their family they had heard of a house in the country which was likely to suit them and they determined to go directly to look at it as they were to be absent all day they foresaw that their officious neighbour would probably interfere with their children they did not choose to exact any promise from them which they might be tempted to break and therefore they only said at parting if mrs theresa tattle should ask you to come to her do as you think proper scarcely had mrs montague's carriage got out of hearing when a note was brought directed to frederick montague junior esq which he immediately opened and read as follows -- mrs theresa tattle presents her very best compliments to the entertaining mr frederick montague she hopes he will have the charity to drink tea with her this evening and bring his charming sister miss marianne with him as mrs theresa will be quite alone with a shocking headache and is sensible her nerves are affected and dr cardamum says that especially in mrs t t 's case it is downright death to nervous patients to be alone an instant she therefore trusts mr frederick will not refuse to come and make her laugh mrs theresa has taken care to provide a few macaroons for her little favourite who said she was particularly fond of them the other day mrs theresa hopes they will all come at six or before not forgetting miss sophy if she will condescend to be of the party at the first reading of this note the entertaining mr frederick and the charming miss marianne laughed heartily and looked at sophy as if they were afraid that she should think it possible they could like such gross flattery but upon a second perusal marianne observed that it certainly was very good-natured of mrs theresa to remember the macaroons and frederick allowed that it was wrong to laugh at the poor woman because she had the headache then twisting the note in his fingers he appealed to sophy -- well sophy leave off drawing for an instant said frederick and tell us what answer can we send can -- we can send what answer we please yes i know that said frederick i would refuse if i could but we ought not to do anything rude should we so i think we might as well go because we could not refuse if we would i say you have made such confusion replied sophy between 'couldn't' and 'wouldn't' and 'shouldn't ' that i can't understand you surely they are all different things different no cried frederick -- could would should might and ought are all the same thing in the latin grammar all of 'em signs of the potential mood you know sophy whose powers of reasoning were not to be confounded even by quotations from the latin grammar looked up soberly from her drawing and answered that very likely those words might be signs of the same thing in the latin grammar but she believed that they meant perfectly different things in real life that's just as people please said her sophistical brother you know words mean nothing in themselves if i choose to call my hat my cadwallader you would understand me just as well after i had once explained it to you that by cadwallader i meant this black thing that i put upon my head cadwallader and hat would then be just the same thing to you then why have two words for the same thing said sophy and what has this to do with 'could' and 'should' you wanted to prove -- i wanted to prove interrupted frederick that it's not worth while to dispute for two hours about two words do keep to the point sophy and don't dispute with me i was not disputing i was reasoning well reasoning or disputing women have no business to do either for how should they know how to chop logic like men at this contemptuous sarcasm upon her sex sophy's colour rose there cried frederick exulting now we shall see a philosopheress in a passion i'd give sixpence half-price for a harlequin entertainment to see sophy in a passion now marianne look at her brush dabbing so fast in the water sophy who could not easily bear to be laughed at with some little indignation said brother i wish -- there there cried frederick pointing to the colour which rose in her cheeks almost to her temples -- rising rising rising look at the thermometer blood heat blood fever heat boiling water heat marianne then said sophy smiling you should stand a little farther off both of you leave the thermometer to itself a little while give it time to cool it will come down to 'temperate' by the time you look again oh brother cried marianne she's so good-humoured don't tease her any more and don't draw heads upon her paper and don't stretch her india-rubber and don't let us dirty any more of her brushes see the sides of her tumbler are all manner of colours oh i only mixed red blue green and yellow to show you marianne that all colours mixed together make white but she is temperate now and i won't plague her she shall chop logic if she likes it though she is a woman but that's not fair brother said marianne to say 'woman' in that way i'm sure sophy found out how to tie that difficult knot which papa showed us yesterday long before you did though you are a man not long said frederick besides that was only a conjuring trick it was very ingenious though said marianne and papa said so besides she understood the 'rule of three ' which was no conjuring trick better than you did though she is a woman and she can reason too mamma says very well let her reason away said the provoking wit all i have to say is that she'll never be able to make a pudding why not pray brother inquired sophy looking up again very gravely why you know papa himself the other day at dinner said that the woman who talks greek and latin as well as i do is a fool after all and that she had better have learned something useful and mrs tattle said she'd answer for it she did not know how to make a pudding well but i am not talking greek and latin am i no but you are drawing and that's the same thing the same thing oh frederick said little marianne laughing you may laugh but i say it is the same sort of thing women who are always drawing and reasoning never know how to make puddings mrs theresa tattle said so when i showed her sophy's beautiful drawing yesterday mrs theresa tattle might say so replied sophy calmly but i do not perceive the reason brother why drawing should prevent me from learning how to make a pudding well i say you'll never learn how to make a good pudding i have learned continued sophy who was mixing her colours to mix such and such colours together to make the colour that i want and why should i not be able to learn to mix flour and butter and sugar and egg together to produce the taste that i want oh but mixing will never do unless you know the quantities like a cook and you would never learn the right quantities how did the cook learn them cannot i learn them as she did yes but you'd never do it exactly and mind the spoonfuls right by the recipe like a cook indeed indeed but she would cried marianne eagerly and a great deal more exactly for mamma has taught her to weigh and measure things very carefully and when i was ill she always weighed the bark in nicely and dropped my drops so carefully better than the cook when mamma took me down to see the cook make a cake once i saw her spoonfuls and her ounces and her handfuls she dashed and splashed without minding exactness or the recipe or anything i'm sure sophy would make a much better pudding if exactness only were wanting well granting that she could make the best pudding in the whole world what does that signify i say she never would so it comes to the same thing never would how can you tell that brother why now look at her with her books and her drawings and all this apparatus do you think she would ever jump up with all her nicety too and put by all these things to go down into the greasy kitchen and plump up to the elbows in suet like a cook for a plum-pudding i need not plump up to the elbows brother said sophy smiling nor is it necessary that i should be a cook but if it were necessary i hope i should be able to make a pudding yes yes cried marianne warmly and she would jump up and put by all her things in a minute if it were necessary and run down stairs and up again like lightning or do anything that was ever so disagreeable to her even about the suet with all her nicety brother i assure you as she used to do anything everything for me when i was ill last winter oh brother she can do anything and she could make the best plum- pudding in the whole world i'm sure in a minute if it were necessary chapter ii a knock at the door from mrs theresa tattle's servant recalled marianne to the business of the day there said frederick we have sent no answer all this time it's necessary to think of that in a minute the servant came with his mistress' compliments to let the young ladies and mr frederick know that she was waiting tea for them waiting then we must go said frederick the servant opened the door wider to let him pass and marianne thought she must follow her brother so they went downstairs together while sophy gave her own message to the servant and quietly stayed at her usual occupations mrs tattle was seated at her tea-table with a large plate of macaroons beside her when frederick and marianne entered she was delighted they were come and grieved not to see miss sophy along with them marianne coloured a little for though she had precipitately followed her brother and though he had quieted her conscience for a moment by saying you know papa and mamma told us to do what we thought best yet she did not feel quite pleased with herself and it was not till after mrs theresa had exhausted all her compliments and half her macaroons that she could restore her spirits to their usual height come mr frederick said she after tea you promised to make me laugh and nobody can make me laugh so well as yourself oh brother said marianne show mrs theresa dr carbuncle eating his dinner and i'll be mrs carbuncle marianne now my dear what shall i help you to frederick my dear she never calls him my dear you know but always doctor mar well then doctor what will you eat to-day fred eat madam eat nothing nothing i don't see anything here i can eat ma'am mar here's eels sir let me help you to some eel -- stewed eel -- you used to be fond of stewed eel fred used ma'am used but i'm sick of stewed eels you would tire one of anything am i to see nothing but eels and what's this at the bottom mar mutton doctor roast mutton if you'll be so good as to cut it fred cut it ma'am i can't cut it i say it's as hard as a deal board you might as well tell me to cut the table ma'am mutton indeed not a bit of fat roast mutton indeed not a drop of gravy mutton truly quite a cinder i'll have none of it here take it away take it downstairs to the cook it's a very hard case mrs carbuncle that i can never have a bit of anything that i can eat at my own table mrs carbuncle since i was married ma'am i that am the easiest man in the whole world to please about my dinner it's really very extraordinary mrs carbuncle what have you at that corner there under the cover mar patties sir oyster patties fred patties ma'am kickshaws i hate kickshaws not worth putting under a cover ma'am and why not have glass covers that one may see one's dinner before one before it grows cold with asking questions mrs carbuncle and lifting up covers but nobody has any sense and i see no water plates anywhere lately mar do pray doctor let me help you to a bit of chicken before it gets cold my dear fred aside my dear again marianne mar yes brother because she is frightened you know and mrs carbuncle always says my dear to him when she's frightened and looks so pale from side to side and sometimes she cries before dinner's done and then all the company are quite silent and don't know what to do oh such a little creature to have so much sense too exclaimed mrs theresa with rapture mr frederick you'll make me die with laughing pray go on dr carbuncle fred well ma'am then if i must eat something send me a bit of fowl a leg and wing the liver wing and a bit of the breast oyster sauce and a slice of that ham if you please ma'am dr carbuncle eats voraciously with his head down to his plate and dropping the sauce he buttons up his coat tight across the breast fred here a plate knife and fork bit o' bread a glass of dorchester ale oh admirable exclaimed mrs tattle clapping her hands now brother suppose that it is after dinner said marianne and show us how the doctor goes to sleep frederick threw himself back in an arm-chair leaning his head back with his mouth open snoring nodded from time to time crossed and uncrossed his legs tried to awake himself by twitching his wig settling his collar blowing his nose and rapping on the lid of his snuff-box all which infinitely diverted mrs tattle who when she could stop herself from laughing declared it made her sigh too to think of the life poor mrs carbuncle led with that man and all for nothing too for her jointure was nothing next to nothing though a great thing to be sure her friends thought for her when she was only sally ridgeway before she was married such a wife as she makes continued mrs theresa lifting up her hands and eyes to heaven and so much as she has gone through the brute ought to be ashamed of himself if he does not leave her something extraordinary in his will for turn it which way she will she can never keep a carriage or live like anybody else on her jointure after all she tells me poor soul a sad prospect after her husband's death to look forward to instead of being comfortable as her friends expected and she poor young thing knowing no better when they married her people should look into these things beforehand or never marry at all i say miss marianne miss marianne who did not clearly comprehend this affair of the jointure or the reason why mrs carbuncle would be so unhappy after her husband's death turned to frederick who was at that instant studying mrs theresa as a future character to mimic brother said marianne now sing an italian song for us like miss croker pray miss croker favour us with a song mrs theresa tattle has never had the pleasure of hearing you sing she's quite impatient to hear you sing yes indeed i am said mrs theresa frederick put his hands before him affectedly oh indeed ma'am indeed ladies i really am so hoarse it distresses me so to be pressed to sing besides upon my word i have quite left off singing i've never sung once except for very particular people this winter mar but mrs theresa tattle is a very particular person i'm sure you'll sing for her fred certainly ma'am i allow that you use a powerful argument but i assure you now i would do my best to oblige you but i absolutely have forgotten all my english songs nobody hears anything but italian now and i have been so giddy as to leave my italian music behind me besides i make it a rule never to hazard myself without an accompaniment mar oh try miss croker for once frederick sings after much preluding violante in the pantry gnawing of a mutton-bone how she gnawed it how she claw'd it when she found herself alone charming exclaimed mrs tattle so like miss croker i'm sure i shall think of you mr frederick when i hear her asked to sing again her voice however introduces her to very pleasant parties and she's a girl that's very much taken notice of and i don't doubt will go off vastly well she's a particular favourite of mine you must know and i mean to do her a piece of service the first opportunity by saying something or other that shall go round to her relations in northumberland and make them do something for her as well they may for they are all rolling in gold and won't give her a penny mar now brother read the newspaper like counsellor puff oh pray do mr frederick for i declare i admire you of all things you are quite yourself to-night here's a newspaper sir pray let us have counsellor puff it's not late frederick reads in a pompous voice as a delicate white hand has ever been deemed a distinguishing ornament in either sex messrs valiant and wise conceive it to be their duty to take the earliest opportunity to advertise the nobility and gentry of great britain in general and their friends in particular that they have now ready for sale as usual at the hippocrates' head a fresh assortment of new-invented much admired primrose soap to prevent impositions and counterfeits the public are requested to take notice that the only genuine primrose soap is stamped on the outside 'valiant and wise ' oh you most incomparable mimic 'tis absolutely the counsellor himself i absolutely must show you some day to my friend lady battersby you'd absolutely make her die with laughing and she'd quite adore you said mrs theresa who was well aware that every pause must be filled with flattery pray go on pray go on i shall never be tired if i sit looking at you these hundred years stimulated by these plaudits frederick proceeded to show how colonel epaulette blew his nose flourished his cambric handkerchief bowed to lady diana periwinkle and admired her work saying done by no hands as you may guess but those of fairly fair whilst lady diana he observed simpered so prettily and took herself so quietly for fairly fair not perceiving that the colonel was admiring his own nails all the while next to colonel epaulette frederick at marianne's particular desire came into the room like sir charles slang very well brother cried she your hand down to the very bottom of your pocket and your other shoulder up to your ear but you are not quite wooden enough and you should walk as if your hip were out of joint there now mrs tattle are not those good eyes they stare so like his without seeming to see anything all the while excellent admirable mr frederick i must say that you are the best mimic of your age i ever saw and i'm sure lady battersby will think so too that is sir charles to the very life but with all that you must know he's a mighty pleasant fashionable young man when you come to know him and has a great deal of sense under all that and is of a very good family -- the slangs you know sir charles will come into a fine fortune himself next year if he can keep clear of gambling which i hear is his foible poor young man pray go on i interrupt you mr frederick now brother said marianne no marianne i can do no more i'm quite tired and i will do no more said frederick stretching himself at full length upon a sofa even in the midst of laughter and whilst the voice of flattery yet sounded in his ear frederick felt sad displeased with himself and disgusted with mrs theresa what a deep sigh was there said mrs theresa what can make you sigh so bitterly you who make everybody else laugh oh such another sigh again marianne cried frederick do you remember the man in the mask what man in the mask brother the man -- the actor -- the buffoon that my father told us of who used to cry behind the mask that made everybody else laugh cry bless me said mrs theresa mighty odd very extraordinary but one can't be surprised at meeting with extraordinary characters amongst that race of people actors by profession you know for they are brought up from the egg to make their fortune or at least their bread by their oddities but my dear mr frederick you are quite pale quite exhausted no wonder -- what will you have a glass of cowslip-wine oh no thank you ma'am said frederick oh yes indeed you must not leave me without taking something and miss marianne must have another macaroon i insist upon it said mrs theresa ringing the bell it is not late and my man christopher will bring up the cowslip-wine in a minute but sophy and papa and mamma you know will come home presently said marianne oh miss sophy has her books and drawings you know she's never afraid of being alone besides to-night it was her own choice and as to your papa and mamma they won't be home to-night i'm pretty sure for a gentleman who had it from their own authority told me where they were going which is further off than they think but they did not consult me and i fancy they'll be obliged to sleep out so you need not be in a hurry about them we'll have candles the door opened just as mrs tattle was going to ring the bell again for candles and the cowslip-wine christopher christopher said mrs theresa who was standing at the fire with her back to the door when it opened christopher pray bring -- do you hear but no christopher answered and upon turning round mrs tattle instead of christopher beheld two little black figures which stood perfectly still and silent it was so dark that their forms could scarcely be discerned in the name of heaven who and what may you be speak i conjure you what are ye the chimney-sweepers ma'am an' please your ladyship chimney-sweepers repeated frederick and marianne bursting out a- laughing chimney-sweepers repeated mrs theresa provoked at the recollection of her late solemn address to them chimney-sweepers and could not you say so a little sooner pray what brings you here gentlemen at this time of night the bell rang ma'am answered a squeaking voice the bell rang yes for christopher the boy's mad or drunk ma'am said the tallest of the chimney-sweepers who had not yet spoken and who now began in a very blunt manner ma'am your brother desired us to come up when the bell rang so we did my brother i have no brother dunce said mrs theresa mr eden madam ho ho said mrs tattle in a more complacent tone the boy takes me for miss bertha eden i perceive and flattered to be taken in the dark by a chimney-sweeper for a young and handsome lady mrs theresa laughed and informed him that they had mistaken the room and they must go up another pair of stairs and turn to the left the chimney-sweeper with the squeaking voice bowed thanked her ladyship for this information said good night to ye quality and they both moved towards the door stay said mrs tattle whose curiosity was excited what can the edens want with chimney-sweepers at this time o' night i wonder christopher did you hear anything about it said the lady to her footman who was now lighting the candles upon my word ma'am said the servant i can't say but i'll step down below and inquire i heard them talking about it in the kitchen but i only got a word here and there for i was hunting for the snuff-dish as i knew it must be for candles when i heard the bell ring ma'am so i thought to find the snuff-dish before i answered the bell for i knew it must be for candles you rang but if you please i'll step down now ma'am and see about the chimney-sweepers yes step down do and christopher bring up the cowslip-wine and some more macaroons for my little marianne marianne withdrew rather coldly from a kiss which mrs tattle was going to give her for she was somewhat surprised at the familiarity with which this lady talked to her footman she had not been accustomed to these familiarities in her father and mother and she did not like them well said mrs tattle to christopher who was now returned what is the news ma'am the little fellow with the squeaking voice has been telling me the whole story the other morning ma'am early he and the other were down the hill sweeping in paradise row those chimneys they say are difficult and the square fellow ma'am the biggest of the two boys got wedged in the chimney the other little fellow was up at the top at the time and he heard the cry but in his fright and all he did not know what to do ma'am for he looked about from the top of the chimney and not a soul could he see stirring but a few that he could not make attend to his screech the boy within almost stifling too so he screeched and screeched all he could and by the greatest chance in life ma'am old mr eden was just going down the hill to fetch his morning walk ay interrupted mrs theresa friend ephraim is one of your early risers well said marianne impatiently so ma'am hearing the screech he turns and sees the sweep and at once he understands the matter -- i'm sure he must have taken some time to understand it interposed mrs tattle for he's the slowest creature breathing and the deafest in company go on christopher so the sweep did make him hear so he says ma'am and so the old gentleman went in and pulled the boy out of the chimney with much ado ma'am bless me exclaimed mrs theresa but did old eden go up the chimney himself after the boy wig and all why ma'am said christopher with a look of great delight that was all as one as the very 'dentical words i put to the boy myself when he telled me his story but ma'am that was what i couldn't get out of him neither rightly for he is a churl -- the big boy that was stuck in the chimney i mean for when i put the question to him about the wig laughing like he wouldn't take it laughing like at all but would only make answer to us like a bear 'he saved my life that's all i know' and this over again ma'am to all the kitchen round that cross-questioned him but i finds him stupid and ill-mannered like for i offered him a shilling ma'am myself to tell about the wig but he put it back in a way that did not become such as he to no lady's butler ma'am whereupon i turns to the slim fellow and he's smarterer and more mannerly ma'am with a tongue in his head for his betters but he could not resolve me my question either for he was up at the top of the chimney the best part o' the time and when he came down mr eden had his wig on but had his arm all bare and bloody ma'am poor mr eden exclaimed marianne oh miss continued the servant and the chimney-sweep himself was so bruised and must have been killed well well but he's alive now go on with your story christopher said mrs t chimney-sweepers get wedged in chimneys every day it's part of their trade and it's a happy thing when they come off with a few bruises to be sure added she observing that both frederick and marianne looked displeased at this speech to be sure if one may believe this story there was some real danger this atrocious practice is now happily superseded by the use of sweeping machines real danger yes indeed said marianne and i'm sure i think mr eden was very good certainly it was a most commendable action and quite providential so i shall take an opportunity of saying when i tell the story in all companies and the boy may thank his kind stars i'm sure to the end of his days for such an escape -- but pray christopher said she persisting in her conversation with christopher who was now laying the cloth for supper pray which house was it in paradise row where the eagles or the miss ropers lodge or which it was at my lady battersby's ma'am ha ha cried mrs theresa i thought we should get to the bottom of the affair at last this is excellent this will make an admirable story for my lady battersby the next time i see her these quakers are so sly old eden i know has long wanted to obtain an introduction into that house and a charming charitable expedient hit upon my lady battersby will enjoy this of all things chapter iii now continued mrs theresa turning to frederick as soon as the servant had left the room now mr frederick montague i have a favour- -such a favour -- to ask of you it's a favour which only you can grant you have such talents and would do the thing so admirably and my lady battersby would quite adore you for it she will do me the honour to be here to spend an evening to-morrow i'm convinced mr and mrs montague will find themselves obliged to stay out another day and i so long to show you off to her ladyship and your doctor carbuncle and your counsellor puff and your miss croker and all your charming characters you must let me introduce you to her ladyship to-morrow evening promise me oh ma'am said frederick i cannot promise you any such thing indeed i am much obliged to you but indeed i cannot come why not my dear sir why not you don't think i mean you should promise if you are certain your papa and mamma will be home if they do come home i will ask them about it said frederick hesitating for though he by no means wished to accept the invitation he had not yet acquired the necessary power of decidedly saying no ask them repeated mrs theresa my dear sir at your age must you ask your papa and mamma about such things must no ma'am said frederick but i said i would i know i need not because my father and mother always let me judge for myself almost about everything and about this i am sure cried marianne papa and mamma you know just as they were going away said 'if mrs theresa asks you to come do as you think best' well then said mrs theresa you know it rests with yourselves if you may do as you please to be sure i may madam said frederick colouring from that species of emotion which is justly called false shame and which often conquers real shame to be sure ma'am i may do as i please then i may make sure of you said mrs theresa for now it would be downright rudeness to tell a lady you won't do as she pleases mr frederick montague i'm sure is too wellbred a young gentleman to do so unpolite so ungallant a thing the jargon of politeness and gallantry is frequently brought by the silly acquaintance of young people to confuse their simple morality and clear good sense a new and unintelligible system is presented to them in a language foreign to their understanding and contradictory to their feelings they hesitate between new motives and old principles from the fear of being thought ignorant they become affected and from the dread of being thought to be children act like fools but all this they feel only when they are in the company of such people as mrs theresa tattle ma'am frederick began i don't mean to be rude but i hope you'll excuse me from coming to drink tea with you to-morrow because my father and mother are not acquainted with lady battersby and maybe they might not like -- take care take care said mrs theresa laughing at his perplexity you want to get off from obliging me and you don't know how you had very nearly made a most shocking blunder in putting it all upon poor lady battersby now you know it's impossible that mr and mrs montague could have in nature the slightest objection to introducing you to my lady battersby at my own house for don't you know that besides her ladyship's many unquestionable qualities which one need not talk of she is cousin but once removed to the trotters of lancashire -- your mother's great favourites and there is not a person at the wells i'll venture to say could be of more advantage to your sister sophy in the way of partners when she comes to go the balls which it's to be supposed she will some time or other and as you are so good a brother that's a thing to be looked to you know besides as to yourself there's nothing her ladyship delights in so much as in a good mimic and she'll quite adore you but i don't want her to adore me ma'am said frederick bluntly then correcting himself added i mean for being a mimic why not my love between friends can there be any harm in showing one's talents you that have such talents to show she'll keep your secret i'll answer for her and added she you needn't be afraid of her criticism for between you and me she's no great critic so you'll come well thank you that's settled how you have made me beg and pray but you know your own value i see as you entertaining people always do one must ask a wit like a fine singer so often well but now for the favour i was going to ask you frederick looked surprised for he thought that the favour of his company was what she meant but she explained herself farther as to the old quaker who lodges above old ephraim eden -- my lady battersby and i have so much diversion about him he is the best character the oddest creature if you were but to see him come into the rooms with those stiff skirts or walking with his eternal sister bertha and his everlasting broad-brimmed hat one knows him a mile off but then his voice and way and altogether if one could get them to the life they'd be better than anything on the stage better even than anything i've seen to-night and i think you'd make a capital quaker for my lady battersby but then the thing is one can never get to hear the old quiz talk now you who have so much invention and cleverness -- i have no invention myself but could you not hit upon some way of seeing him so that you might get him by heart i'm sure you who are so quick would only want to see him and hear him for half a minute to be able to take him off so as to kill one with laughing but i have no invention oh as to the invention said frederick i know an admirable way of doing the thing if that is all but then remember i don't say i will do the thing for i will not but i know a way of getting up into his room and seeing him without his knowing me to be there oh tell it me you charming clever creature but remember i do not say i will do it well well let us hear it and you shall do as you please afterwards merciful goodness exclaimed mrs tattle do my ears deceive me i declare i looked round and thought i heard the squeaking chimney-sweeper was in the room so did i frederick i declare cried marianne laughing i never heard anything so like his voice in my life frederick imitated the squeaking voice of this chimney-sweeper to great perfection now continued he this fellow is just my height the old quaker if my face were blackened and if i were to change clothes with the chimney- sweeper i'll answer for it would never know me oh it's an admirable invention i give you infinite credit for it exclaimed mrs theresa it shall it must be done i'll ring and have the fellow up this minute oh no do not ring said frederick stopping her hand i don't mean to do it you know you promised that i should do as i pleased i only told you my invention well well but only let me ring and ask whether the chimney-sweepers are below you shall do as you please afterwards christopher shut the door christopher said she to the servant who came up when she rang pray are the sweeps gone yet no ma'am but have they been up to old eden yet oh no ma'am nor be not to go till the bell rings for miss bertha ma'am was asleep a-lying down and her brother wouldn't have her wakened on no account whatsomever he came down hisself to the kitchen to the sweeps though but wouldn't have as i heard him say his sister waked for no account but miss bertha's bell will ring when she wakens for the sweeps ma'am 'twas she wanted to see the boy as her brother saved and i suppose sent for him to give him something charitable ma'am well never mind your suppositions said mrs theresa run down this very minute to the little squeaking chimney-sweep and send him up to me quick but don't let the other bear come up with him christopher who had curiosity as well as his mistress when he returned with the chimney-sweeper prolonged his own stay in the room by sweeping the hearth throwing down the tongs and shovel and picking them up again that will do christopher christopher that will do i say mrs theresa repeated in vain she was obliged to say christopher you may go before he would depart now said she to frederick step in here to the next room with this candle and you'll be equipped in an instant only just change clothes with the boy only just let me see what a charming chimney-sweeper you'd make you shall do as you please afterwards well i'll only change clothes with him just to show you for one minute but said marianne to mrs theresa whilst frederick was changing his clothes i think frederick is right about -- about what love i think he is in the right not to go up though he can do it so easily to see that gentleman i mean on purpose to mimic and laugh at him afterwards i don't think that would be quite right why pray miss marianne why because he is so good-natured to his sister he would not let her be wakened dear it's easy to be good in such little things and he won't have long to be good to her neither for i don't think she will trouble him long in this world anyhow what do you mean said marianne that she'll die child die die with that beautiful colour in her cheeks how sorry her poor poor brother will be but she will not die i'm sure for she walks about and runs upstairs so lightly oh you must be quite mistaken i hope if i'm mistaken dr panado cardamum's mistaken too then that's my comfort he says unless the waters work a miracle she stands a bad chance and she won't follow my advice and consult the doctor for her health he would frighten her to death perhaps said marianne i hope frederick won't go up to disturb her lud child you are turned simpleton all of a sudden how can your brother disturb her more than the real chimney-sweeper but i don't think it's right persisted marianne and i shall tell him so nay miss marianne i don't commend you now young ladies should not be so forward to give opinions and advice to their elder brothers unasked and i presume that mr frederick and i must know what's right as well as miss marianne hush here he is oh the capital figure cried mrs theresa bravo bravo cried she as frederick entered in the chimney- sweeper's dress and as he spoke saying i'm afraid please your ladyship to dirt your ladyship's carpet she broke out into immoderate raptures calling him her charming chimney-sweeper and repeating that she knew beforehand the character would do for him mrs theresa instantly rang the bell in spite of all expostulation -- ordered christopher to send up the other chimney-sweeper -- triumphed in observing that christopher did not know frederick when he came into the room and offered to lay any wager that the other chimney-sweeper would mistake him for his companion and so he did and when frederick spoke the voice was so very like that it was scarcely possible that he should have perceived the difference marianne was diverted by this scene but she started when in the midst of it they heard a bell ring that's the lady's bell and we must go said the blunt chimney-sweeper go then about your business said mrs theresa and here's a shilling for you to drink my honest fellow i did not know you were so much bruised when i first saw you i won't detain you go said she pushing frederick towards the door marianne sprang forward to speak to him but mrs theresa kept her off and though frederick resisted the lady shut the door upon him by superior force and having locked it there was no retreat mrs tattle and marianne waited impatiently for frederick's return i hear them cried marianne i hear them coming downstairs they listened again and all was silent at length they suddenly heard a great noise of many steps in the hall merciful exclaimed mrs theresa it must be your father and mother come back marianne ran to unlock the room door and mrs theresa followed her into the hall the hall was rather dark but under the lamp a crowd of people all the servants in the house having gathered together as mrs theresa approached the crowd opened in silence and in the midst she beheld frederick with blood streaming from his face his head was held by christopher and the chimney-sweeper was holding a basin for him merciful what will become of me exclaimed mrs theresa bleeding he'll bleed to death can nobody think of anything that will stop blood in a minute a key a large key down his back -- a key -- has nobody a key mr and mrs montague will be here before he has done bleeding a key cobwebs a puff ball for mercy's sake can nobody think of anything that will stop blood in a minute gracious me he'll bleed to death i believe he'll bleed to death oh my brother cried marianne catching hold of the words and terrified she ran upstairs crying sophy oh sophy come down this minute or he'll be dead my brother's bleeding to death sophy sophy come down or he'll be dead let go the basin you said christopher pulling the basin out of the chimney-sweeper's hand who had all this time stood in silence you are not fit to hold the basin for a gentleman let him hold it said frederick he did not mean to hurt me that's more than he deserves i'm certain sure he might have known well enough it was mr frederick all the time and he'd no business to go to fight -- such a one as he -- with a gentleman i did not know he was a gentleman said the chimney-sweeper how could i how could he indeed said frederick he shall hold the basin gracious me i'm glad to hear him speak like himself again at anyrate cried mrs theresa and here comes miss sophy too sophy cried frederick oh sophy don't you come -- don't look at me you'll despise me my brother where where said sophy looking as she thought at the two chimney-sweepers it's frederick said marianne that's my brother miss sophy don't be alarmed mrs theresa began but gracious goodness i wish miss bertha -- at this instant a female figure in white appeared upon the stairs she passed swiftly on whilst everyone gave way before her oh miss bertha cried mrs theresa catching hold of her gown to stop her as she came near frederick oh miss eden your beautiful india muslin take care of the chimney sweeper for heaven's sake but she pressed forward it's my brother will he die cried marianne throwing her arms round her and looking up as if to a being of a superior order will he bleed to death no my love answered a sweet voice do not frighten thyself i've done bleeding said frederick dear me miss marianne if you would not make such a rout cried mrs tattle miss bertha it's nothing but a frolic you see mr frederick montague only in a masquerade dress nothing in the world but a frolic ma'am you see he's stopped bleeding i was frightened out of my wits at first i thought it was his eye but i see it's only his nose all's well that ends well mr frederick we'll keep your counsel pray ma'am let us ask no questions it's only a boyish frolic come mr frederick this way into my room and i'll give you a towel and some clean water and you can get rid of this masquerade dress make haste for fear your father and mother should drop in upon us do not be afraid of thy father and mother they are surely thy best friends said a voice it was the voice of an elderly gentleman who now stood behind frederick oh sir oh mr eden said frederick turning to him don't betray me for goodness' sake whispered mrs tattle say nothing about me i'm not thinking about you let me speak cried he pushing away her hand which stopped his mouth i shall say nothing about you i promise you said frederick with a look of contempt no but for your own sake my dear sir your papa and mamma bless me is not that mrs montague's carriage my brother ma'am said sophy is not afraid of my father and mother's coming back let him speak he was going to speak the truth to be sure miss sophia i wouldn't hinder him from speaking the truth but it's not proper i presume ma'am to speak truth at all times and in all places and before everybody servants and all i only wanted ma'am to hinder your brother from exposing himself a hall i apprehend is not a proper place for explanation here said mr eden opening the door of his room which was on the opposite side of the hall to mrs tattle's here is a place said he to frederick where thou mayst speak the truth at all times and before everybody nay my room's at mr frederick montague's service and my door's open too this way pray said she pulling his arm but frederick broke from her and followed mr eden oh sir will you forgive me cried he forgive thee -- and what have i to forgive forgive brother without asking what said bertha smiling he shall know all cried frederick all that concerns myself i mean sir i disguised myself in this dress i came up to your room to-night on purpose to see you without your knowing it that i might mimic you the chimney-sweeper where is he said frederick looking round and he ran into the hall to see for him may he come in he may -- he is a brave an honest good grateful boy he never guessed who i was after we left you we went down to the kitchen together and there fool as i was for the pleasure of making mr christopher and the servants laugh began to mimic you this boy said he would not stand by and hear you laughed at that you had saved his life that i ought to be ashamed of myself that you had just given me half a crown and so you had but i went on and told him i'd knock him down if he said another word he did i gave the first blow we fought i came to the ground the servants pulled me up again they found out i don't know how that i was not a chimney- sweeper the rest you saw and now can you forgive me sir said frederick to mr eden seizing hold of his hand the other hand friend said the quaker gently withdrawing his right hand which everybody now observed was much swelled and putting it into his bosom again this and welcome offering his other hand to frederick and shaking his with a smile oh that other hand said frederick that was hurt i remember how ill i have behaved -- extremely ill but this is a lesson that i shall never forget as long as i live i hope for the future i shall behave like a gentleman and like a man -- and like a good man i am sure thou wilt said the good quaker shaking frederick's hand affectionately or i am much mistaken friend in that black countenance you are not mistaken cried marianne frederick will never be persuaded again by anybody to do what he does not think right and now brother you may wash your black countenance just when frederick had got rid of half his black countenance a double knock was heard at the door it was mr and mrs montague what will you do now whispered mrs theresa to frederick as his father and mother came into the room a chimney-sweeper covered with blood exclaimed mr and mrs montague father i am frederick said he stepping forward towards them as they stood in astonishment frederick my son yes mother i'm not hurt half so much as i deserve i'll tell you -- nay interrupted bertha let my brother tell the story this time thou hast told it once and told it well no one but my brother could tell it better a story never tells so well the second time to be sure said mrs theresa but mr eden will certainly make the best of it without taking any notice of mrs tattle or her apprehensive looks mr eden explained all he knew of the affair in a few words your son concluded he will quickly put off his dirty dress the dress hath not stained the mind that is fair and honourable when he found himself in the wrong he said so nor was he in haste to conceal his adventure from his father this made me think well of both father and son i speak plainly friend for that is best but what is become of the other chimney-sweeper he will want to go home said mr eden turning to mrs theresa without making any reply she hurried out of the room as fast as possible and returned in a few moments with a look of extreme consternation here is a catastrophe indeed now indeed mr frederick your papa and mamma have reason to be angry a new suit of clothes -- the bare faced villain gone no sign of them in my closet or anywhere the door was locked he must have gone up the chimney out upon the leads and so escaped but christopher is after him i protest mrs montague you take it too quietly the wretch -- a new suit of clothes blue coat and buff waistcoat i never heard of such a thing i declare mr montague you are vastly good not to be in a passion added mrs theresa madam replied mr montague with a look of much civil contempt i think the loss of a suit of clothes and even the disgrace that my son has been brought to this evening fortunate circumstances in his education he will i am persuaded judge and act for himself more wisely in future nor will he be tempted to offend against humanity for the sake of being called 'the best mimic in the world ' the barring out or party spirit the mother of mischief says an old proverb is no bigger than a midge's wing at doctor middleton's school there was a great tall dunce of the name of fisher who never could be taught how to look out a word in the dictionary he used to torment everybody with -- do pray help me i can't make out this one word the person who usually helped him in his distress was a very clever good natured boy of the name of de grey who had been many years under dr middleton's care and who by his abilities and good conduct did him great credit the doctor certainly was both proud and fond of him but he was so well beloved or so much esteemed by his companions that nobody had ever called him by the odious name of favourite until the arrival of a new scholar of the name of archer till archer came the ideas of favourites and parties were almost unknown at dr middleton's but he brought all these ideas fresh from a great public school at which he had been educated -- at which he had acquired a sufficient quantity of greek and latin and a superabundant quantity of party spirit his aim the moment he came to a new school was to get to the head of it or at least to form the strongest party his influence for he was a boy of considerable abilities was quickly felt though he had a powerful rival as he thought proper to call him in de grey and with him a rival was always an enemy de grey so far from giving him any cause of hatred treated him with a degree of cordiality which would probably have had an effect upon archer's mind if it had not been for the artifices of fisher it may seem surprising that a great dunce should be able to work upon a boy like an archer who was called a great genius but when genius is joined to a violent temper instead of being united to good sense it is at the mercy even of dunces fisher was mortally offended one morning by de grey's refusing to translate his whole lesson for him he went over to archer who considering him as a partisan deserting from the enemy received him with open arms and translated his whole lesson without expressing much contempt for his stupidity from this moment fisher forgot all de grey's former kindness and considered only how he could in his turn mortify the person whom he felt to be so much his superior de grey and archer were now reading for a premium which was to be given in their class fisher betted on archer's head who had not sense enough to despise the bet of a blockhead on the contrary he suffered him to excite the spirit of rivalship in its utmost fury by collecting the bets of all the school so that this premium now became a matter of the greatest consequence and archer instead of taking the means to secure a judgment in his favour was listening to the opinions of all his companions it was a prize which was to be won by his own exertions but he suffered himself to consider it as an affair of chance the consequence was that he trusted to chance -- his partisans lost their wagers and he the premium -- and his temper mr archer said dr middleton after the grand affair was decided you have done all that genius alone could do but you de grey have done all that genius and industry united could do well cried archer with affected gaiety as soon as the doctor had left the room -- well i'm content with my sentence genius alone for me -- industry for those who want it added he with a significant look at de grey fisher applauded this as a very spirited speech and by insinuations that dr middleton always gave the premium to de grey and that those who had lost their bets might thank themselves for it for being such simpletons as to bet against the favourite he raised a murmur highly flattering to archer amongst some of the most credulous boys whilst others loudly proclaimed their belief in dr middleton's impartiality these warmly congratulated de grey at this archer grew more and more angry and when fisher was proceeding to speak nonsense for him pushed forward into the circle to de grey crying i wish mr fisher you would let me fight my own battles and i wish said young townsend who was fonder of diversions than of premiums or battles or of anything else -- i wish that we were not to have any battles after having worked like horses don't set about to fight like dogs come said he tapping de grey's shoulder let us see your new playhouse do -- it's a holiday and let us make the most of it let us have the 'school for scandal ' do and i'll play charles for you and you de grey shall be my little premium come do open this new playhouse of yours to-night come then said de grey and he ran across the playground to a waste building at the farthest end of it in which at the earnest request of the whole community and with the permission of dr middleton he had with much pain and ingenuity erected a theatre the new theatre is going to be opened follow the manager follow the manager echoed a multitude of voices follow the manager echoed very disagreeably in archer's ear but as he could not be left alone he was also obliged to follow the manager the moment that the door was unlocked the crowd rushed in the delight and wonder expressed at the sight was great and the applause and thanks which were bestowed upon the manager were long and loud archer at least thought them long for he was impatient till his voice could be heard when at length the acclamations had spent themselves he walked across the stage with a knowing air and looking round contemptuously and is this your famous playhouse cried he i wish you had any of you seen the playhouse i have been used to these words made a great and visible change in the feelings and opinions of the public who would be a servant of the public or who would toil for popular applause a few words spoken in a decisive tone by a new voice operated as a charm and the playhouse was in an instant metamorphosed in the eyes of the spectators all gratitude for the past was forgotten and the expectation of something better justified to the capricious multitude their disdain of what they had so lately pronounced to be excellent everyone now began to criticise one observed that the green curtain was full of holes and would not draw up another attacked the scenes scenes they were not like real scenes -- archer must know best because he was used to these things so everybody crowded to hear something of the other playhouse they gathered round archer to hear the description of his playhouse and at every sentence insulting comparisons were made when he had done his auditors looked round sighed and wished that archer had been their manager they turned from de grey as from a person who had done them an injury some of his friends -- for he had friends who were not swayed by the popular opinion -- felt indignation at this ingratitude and were going to express their feelings but de grey stopped them and begged that he might speak for himself gentlemen said he coming forward as soon as he felt that he had sufficient command of himself my friends i see you are discontented with me and my playhouse i have done my best to please you but if anybody else can please you better i shall be glad of it i did not work so hard for the glory of being your manager you have my free leave to tear down -- here his voice faltered but he hurried on -- you have my free leave to tear down all my work as fast as you please archer shake hands first however to show that there's no malice in the case archer who was touched by what his rival said and stopping the hand of his new partisan fisher cried no fisher no -- no pulling down we can alter it there is a great deal of ingenuity in it considering in vain archer would now have recalled the public to reason -- the time for reason was passed enthusiasm had taken hold of their minds down with it down with it archer for ever cried fisher and tore down the curtain the riot once begun nothing could stop the little mob till the whole theatre was demolished the love of power prevailed in the mind of archer he was secretly flattered by the zeal of his party and he mistook their love of mischief for attachment to himself de grey looked on superior i said i could bear to see all this and i can said he now it is all over and now it was all over there was silence the rioters stood still to take breath and to look at what they had done there was a blank space before them in this moment of silence there was heard something like a voice hush what strange voice is that said archer fisher caught fast hold of his arm everybody looked round to see where the voice came from it was dusk two window-shutters at the farthest end of the building were seen to move slowly inwards de grey and in the same instant archer went forward and as the shutters opened there appeared through the hole the dark face and shrivelled hands of a very old gipsy she did not speak but she looked first at one and then at another at length she fixed her eyes on de grey well woman said he what do you want with me want -- nothing -- with you said the old woman do you want nothing with me nothing said de grey her eye immediately turned upon archer -- you want something with me said she with emphasis i -- what do i want replied archer no said she changing her tone you want nothing -- nothing will you ever want or i am much mistaken in that face in that watch-chain she should have said for her quick eye had espied archer's watch-chain he was the only person in the company who had a watch and she therefore judged him to be the richest had you ever your fortune told sir in your life not i said he looking at de grey as if he was afraid of his ridicule if he listened to the gipsy not you no for you will make your own fortune and the fortune of all that belong to you there's good news for my friends cried archer and i'm one of them remember that cried fisher and i and i joined a number of voices good luck to them cried the gipsy good luck to them all then as soon as they had acquired sufficient confidence in her good will they pressed up to the window there cried townsend as he chanced to stumble over the carpenter's mitre box which stood in the way there's a good omen for me i've stumbled on the mitre box i shall certainly be a bishop happy he who had sixpence for he bid fair to be a judge upon the bench and happier he who had a shilling for he was in the high road to be one day upon the woolsack lord high chancellor of england no one had half a crown or no one would surely have kept it in his pocket upon such an occasion for he might have been an archbishop a king or what he pleased fisher who like all weak people was extremely credulous kept his post immovable in the front row all the time his mouth open and his stupid eyes fixed upon the gipsy in whom he felt implicit faith those who have least confidence in their own powers and who have least expectation from the success of their own exertions are always most disposed to trust in fortune-tellers and fortune they hope to win when they cannot earn and as they can never be convinced by those who speak sense it is no wonder they are always persuaded by those who talk nonsense i have a question to put said fisher in a solemn tone put it then said archer what hinders you but they will hear me said he looking suspiciously at de grey i shall not hear you said de grey i am going everybody else drew back and left him to whisper his question in the gipsy's ear what is become of my livy your sister livy do you mean said the gipsy no my latin livy the gipsy paused for information it had a leaf torn out in the beginning and i hate dr middleton -- written in it interrupted the gipsy right -- the very book cried fisher with joy but how could you know it was dr middleton's name i thought i had scratched it so that nobody could make it out nobody could make it out but me replied the gipsy but never think to deceive me said she shaking her head at him in a manner that made him tremble i don't deceive you indeed i tell you the whole truth i lost it a week ago true and when shall i find it meet me here at this hour to-morrow evening and i will answer you no more i must be gone not a word more to-night she pulled the shutters towards her and left the youth in darkness all his companions were gone he had been so deeply engaged in this conference that he had not perceived their departure he found all the world at supper but no entreaties could prevail upon him to disclose his secret townsend rallied in vain as for archer he was not disposed to destroy by ridicule the effect which he saw that the old woman's predictions in his favour had had upon the imagination of many of his little partisans he had privately slipped two good shillings into the gipsy's hand to secure her for he was willing to pay any price for any means of acquiring power the watch-chain had not deceived the gipsy for archer was the richest person in the community his friends had imprudently supplied him with more money than is usually trusted to boys of his age dr middleton had refused to give him a larger monthly allowance than the rest of his companions but he brought to school with him secretly the sum of five guineas this appeared to his friends and to himself an inexhaustible treasure riches and talents would he flattered himself secure to him that ascendancy of which he was so ambitious am i your manager or not was now his question i scorn to take advantage of a hasty moment but since last night you have had time to consider if you desire me to be your manager you shall see what a theatre i will make for you in this purse said he showing through the network a glimpse of the shining treasure -- in this purse is aladdin's wonderful lamp am i your manager put it to the vote it was put to the vote about ten of the most reasonable of the assembly declared their gratitude and high approbation of their old friend de grey but the numbers were in favour of the new friend and as no metaphysical distinctions relative to the idea of a majority had ever entered their thoughts the most numerous party considered themselves as now beyond dispute in the right they drew off on one side in triumph and their leader who knew the consequence of a name in party matters immediately distinguished his partisans by the gallant name of archers stigmatizing the friends of de grey by the odious epithet of greybeards amongst the archers was a class not very remarkable for their mental qualifications but who by their bodily activity and by the peculiar advantages annexed to their way of life rendered themselves of the highest consequence especially to the rich and enterprising the judicious reader will apprehend that i allude to the persons called day scholars amongst these fisher was distinguished by his knowledge of all the streets and shops in the adjacent town and though a dull scholar he had such reputation as a man of business that whoever had commissions to execute at the confectioner's was sure to apply to him some of the youngest of his employers had it is true at times complained that he made mistakes of halfpence and pence in their accounts but as these affairs could never be brought to a public trial fisher's character and consequence were undiminished till the fatal day when his aunt barbara forbade his visits to the confectioner's or rather till she requested the confectioner who had his private reasons for obeying her not to receive her nephew's visits as he had made himself sick at his house and mrs barbara's fears for his health were incessant though his visits to the confectioner's were thus at an end there were many other shops open to him and with officious zeal he offered his services to the new manager to purchase whatever might be wanting for the theatre since his father's death fisher had become a boarder at dr middleton's but his frequent visits to his aunt barbara afforded him opportunities of going into the town the carpenter de grey's friend was discarded by archer for having said lack-a-daisy when he saw that the old theatre was pulled down a new carpenter and paper hanger recommended by fisher were appointed to attend with their tools for orders at two o'clock archer impatient to show his ingenuity and his generosity gave his plan and his orders in a few minutes in a most decided manner these things he observed should be done with some spirit to which the carpenter readily assented and added that gentlemen of spirit never looked to the expense but always to the effect upon this principle mr chip set to work with all possible alacrity in a few hours' time he promised to produce a grand effect high expectations were formed nothing was talked of but the new playhouse and so intent upon it was every head that no lessons could be got archer was obliged in the midst of his various occupations to perform the part of grammar and dictionary for twenty different people o ye athenians he exclaimed how hard do i work to obtain your praise impatient to return to the theatre the moment the hours destined for instruction or as they are termed by schoolboys school-hours were over each prisoner started up with a shout of joy stop one moment gentlemen if you please said dr middleton in an awful voice mr archer return to your place are you all here the names of all the boys were called over and when each had answered to his name dr middleton said -- gentlemen i am sorry to interrupt your amusements but till you have contrary orders from me no one on pain of my serious displeasure must go into that building pointing to the place where the theatre was erecting mr archer your carpenter is at the door you will be so good as to dismiss him i do not think proper to give my reasons for these orders but you who know me said the doctor and his eye turned towards de grey will not suspect me of caprice i depend gentlemen upon your obedience to the dead silence with which these orders were received succeeded in a few minutes a universal groan so said townsend all our diversion is over so whispered fisher in the manager's ear this is some trick of the greybeard's did you not observe how he looked at de grey fired by this thought which had never entered his mind before archer started from his reverie and striking his hand upon the table swore that he would not be outwitted by any greybeard in europe -- no nor by all of them put together the archers were surely a match for them he would stand by them if they would stand by him he declared with a loud voice against the whole world and dr middleton himself with 'little premiums' at his right hand everybody admired archer's spirit but were a little appalled at the sound of standing against dr middleton why not resumed the indignant manager neither dr middleton nor any doctor upon earth shall treat me with injustice this you see is a stroke at me and my party and i won't bear it oh you are mistaken said de grey who was the only one who dared to oppose reason to the angry orator it cannot be a stroke aimed at 'you and your party ' for he does not know that you have a party i'll make him know it and i'll make you know it too said archer before i came here you reigned alone now your reign is over mr de grey remember my majority this morning and your theatre last night he has remembered it said fisher you see the moment he was not to be our manager we were to have no theatre no playhouse no plays we must all sit down with our hands before us -- all for 'good reasons' of dr middleton's which he does not vouchsafe to tell us i won't be governed by any man's reasons that he won't tell me cried archer he cannot have good reasons or why not tell them nonsense said de grey we shall not suspect him of caprice why not because we who know him have never known him capricious perhaps not i know nothing about him said archer no said de grey for that very reason i speak who do know him don't be in a passion archer i will be in a passion i won't submit to tyranny i won't be made a fool of by a few soft words you don't know me de grey i'll go through with what i've begun i am manager and i will be manager and you shall see my theatre finished in spite of you and my party triumphant party repeated de grey i cannot imagine what is in the word 'party' that seems to drive you mad we never heard of parties till you came amongst us no before i came i say nobody dared oppose you but i dare and i tell you to your face take care of me -- a warm friend and a bitter enemy is my motto i am not your enemy i believe you are out of your senses archer said he laughing out of my senses no you are my enemy are you not my rival did not you win the premium did not you want to be manager answer me are not you in one word a greybeard you called me a greybeard but my name is de grey said he still laughing laugh on cried the other furiously come archers follow me we shall laugh by-and-by i promise you at the door archer was stopped by mr chip oh mr chip i am ordered to discharge you yes sir and here's a little bill -- bill mr chip why you have not been at work for two hours not much over sir but if you'll please to look into it you'll see 'tis for a few things you ordered the stuff is all laid out and delivered the paper and the festoon-bordering for the drawing room scene is cut out and left yander within yander within i wish you had not been in such a confounded hurry -- six-and-twenty shillings cried he but i can't stay to talk about it now i'll tell you mr chip said archer lowering his voice what you must do for me my good fellow then drawing mr chip aside he begged him to pull down some of the wood work which had been put up and to cut it into a certain number of wooden bars of which he gave him the dimensions with orders to place them all when ready under a haystack which he pointed out mr chip scrupled and hesitated and began to talk of the doctor archer immediately began to talk of the bill and throwing down a guinea and a half the conscientious carpenter pocketed the money directly and made his bow well master archer said he there's no refusing you nothing you have such a way of talking one out of it you manage me just like a child ay ay said archer knowing that he had been cheated and yet proud of managing a carpenter ay ay i know the way to manage everybody let the things be ready in an hour's time and hark'e leave your tools by mistake behind you and a thousand of twenty-penny nails ask no questions and keep your own counsel like a wise man off with you and take care of 'the doctor ' archers archers to the archers' tree follow your leader cried he sounding his well known whistle as a signal his followers gathered round him and he raising himself upon the mount at the foot of the tree counted his numbers and then in a voice lower than usual addressed them thus -- my friends is there a greybeard amongst us if there is let him walk off at once he has my free leave no one stirred then we are all archers and we will stand by one another join hands my friends they all joined hands promise me not to betray me and i will go on i ask no security but your honour they all gave their honour to be secret and faithful as he called it and he went on did you ever hear of such a thing as a 'barring out ' my friends they had heard of such a thing but they had only heard of it archer gave the history of a barring out in which he had been concerned at his school in which the boys stood out against the master and gained their point at last which was a week's more holidays at easter but if we should not succeed said they dr middleton is so steady he never goes back from what he has said did you ever try to push him back let us be steady and he'll tremble tyrants always tremble when -- oh interrupted a number of voices but he is not a tyrant -- is he all schoolmasters are tyrants -- are not they replied archer and is not he a schoolmaster to this logic there was no answer but still reluctant they asked what they should get by a barring out get -- everything -- what we want -- which is everything to lads of spirit- -victory and liberty bar him out till he repeals his tyrannical law till he lets us into our own theatre again or till he tells us his 'good reasons' against it but perhaps he has reasons for not telling us impossible cried archer that's the way we are always to be governed by a man in a wig who says he has good reasons and can't tell them are you fools go go back to de grey i see you are all greybeards go who goes first nobody would go first i will have nothing to do with ye if ye are resolved to be slaves we won't be slaves they all exclaimed at once then said archer stand out in the right and be free this custom of barring out was very general especially in the northern parts of england during the 17th and 18th centuries and it has been fully described by brand and other antiquarian writers dr johnson mentions that addison while under the tuition of mr shaw master of the lichfield grammar school led and successfully conducted a plan for barring out his master a disorderly privilege says the doctor which in his time prevailed in the principal seminaries of education in the gentleman's magazine of 1828 dr p a nuttall under the signature of ii a n has given a spirited sketch of a barring out at the ormskirk grammar school which has since been republished at length though without acknowledgment by sir henry ellis in bohn's recent edition of brand's popular antiquities this operation took place early in the present century and is interesting from its being perhaps the last attempt on record and also from the circumstance of the writer himself having been one of the juvenile leaders in the daring adventure quo rum pars magna fuit -- ed the right it would have taken up too much time to examine what the right was archer was always sure that the right was what his party chose to do that is what he chose to do himself and such is the influence of numbers upon each other in conquering the feelings of shame and in confusing the powers of reasoning that in a few minutes the right was forgotten and each said to himself to be sure archer is a very clever boy and he can't be mistaken or to be sure townsend thinks so and he would not do anything to get us into a scrape or to be sure everybody will agree to this but myself and i can't stand out alone to be pointed at as a greybeard and a slave everybody thinks it is right and everybody can't be wrong by some of these arguments which passed rapidly through the mind without his being conscious of them each boy decided and deceived himself -- what none would have done alone none scrupled to do as a party it was determined then that there should be a barring out the arrangement of the affair was left to their new manager to whom they all pledged implicit obedience obedience it seems is necessary even from rebels to their ringleaders not reasonable but implicit obedience scarcely had the assembly adjourned to the ball-alley when fisher with an important length of face came up to the manager and desired to speak one word to him my advice to you archer is to do nothing in this till we have consulted you know who about whether it's right or wrong 'you know who ' whom do you mean make haste and don't make so many faces for i'm in a hurry who is 'you know who ' the old woman said fisher gravely the gipsy you may consult the old woman said archer bursting out a-laughing about what's right and wrong if you please but no old woman shall decide for me no but you don't take me said fisher you don't take me by right and wrong i mean lucky and unlucky whatever i do will be lucky replied archer my gipsy told you that already i know i know said fisher and what she said about your friends being lucky -- that went a great way with many added he with a sagacious nod of his head i can tell you that -- more than you think do you know said he laying hold of archer's button i'm in the secret there are nine of us have crooked our little fingers upon it not to stir a step till we get her advice and she has appointed me to meet her about particular business of my own at eight so i'm to consult her and to bring her answer archer knew too well how to govern fools to attempt to reason with them and instead of laughing any longer at fisher's ridiculous superstition he was determined to take advantage of it he affected to be persuaded of the wisdom of the measure looked at his watch urged him to be exact to a moment conjured him to remember exactly the words of the oracle and above all things to demand the lucky hour and minute when the barring out should begin with these instructions archer put his watch into the solemn dupe's hand and left him to count the seconds till the moment of his appointment whilst he ran off himself to prepare the oracle at a little gate which looked into a lane through which he guessed that the gipsy must pass he stationed himself saw her gave her half a crown and her instructions made his escape and got back unsuspected to fisher whom he found in the attitude in which he had left him watching the motion of the minute hand proud of his secret commission fisher slouched his hat he knew not why over his face and proceeded towards the appointed spot to keep as he had been charged by archer within the letter of the law he stood behind the forbidden building and waited some minutes through a gap in the hedge the old woman at length made her appearance muffled up and looking cautiously about her there's nobody near us said fisher and he began to be a little afraid what answer said he recollecting himself about my livy lost lost lost said the gipsy lifting up her hands never never never to be found but no matter for that now that is not your errand to-night no tricks with me speak to me of what is next your heart fisher astonished put his hand upon his heart told her all that she knew before and received the answers that archer had dictated that the archers should be lucky as long as they stuck to their manager and to one another that the barring out should end in woe if not begun precisely as the clock should strike nine on wednesday night but if begun in that lucky moment and all obedient to their lucky leader all should end well a thought a provident thought now struck fisher for even he had some foresight where his favourite passion was concerned pray in our barring out shall we be starved no said the gipsy not if you trust to me for food and if you give me money enough silver won't do for so many gold is what must cross my hand i have no gold said fisher and i don't know what you mean by 'so many ' i'm only talking of number one you know i must take care of that first so as fisher thought it was possible that archer clever as he was might be disappointed in his supplies he determined to take secret measures for himself his aunt barbara's interdiction had shut him out of the confectioner's shop but he flattered himself that he could outwit his aunt he therefore begged the gipsy to procure him twelve buns by thursday morning and bring them secretly to one of the windows of the schoolroom as fisher did not produce any money when he made this proposal it was at first absolutely rejected but a bribe at length conquered his difficulties and the bribe which fisher found himself obliged to give -- for he had no pocket money left of his own he being as much restricted in that article as archer was indulged -- the bribe that he found himself obliged to give to quiet the gipsy was half a crown which archer had intrusted to him to buy candles for the theatre oh thought he to himself archer's so careless about money he will never think of asking me for the half-crown again and now he'll want no candles for the theatre or at anyrate it will be some time first and maybe aunt barbara may be got to give me that much at christmas then if the worst comes to the worst one can pay archer my mouth waters for the buns and have 'em i must now so for the hope of twelve buns he sacrificed the money which had been intrusted to him thus the meanest motives in mean minds often prompt to the commission of those great faults to which one should think nothing but some violent passion could have tempted the ambassador having thus in his opinion concluded his own and the public business returned well satisfied with the result after receiving the gipsy's reiterated promise to tap three times at the window on thursday morning the day appointed for the barring out at length arrived and archer assembling the confederates informed them that all was prepared for carrying their design into execution that he now depended for success upon their punctuality and courage he had within the last two hours got all their bars ready to fasten the doors and window shutters of the schoolroom he had with the assistance of two of the day scholars who were of the party sent into the town for provisions at his own expense which would make a handsome supper for that night he had also negotiated with some cousins of his who lived in the town for a constant supply in future bless me exclaimed archer suddenly stopping in this narration of his services there's one thing after all i've forgot we shall be undone without it fisher pray did you ever buy the candles for the playhouse no to be sure replied fisher extremely frightened you know you don't want candles for the playhouse now not for the playhouse but for the barring out we shall be in the dark man you must run this minute run for candles said fisher confused how many -- what sort stupidity exclaimed archer you are a pretty fellow at a dead lift lend me a pencil and a bit of paper do i'll write down what i want myself well what are you fumbling for for money said fisher colouring money man didn't i give you half a crown the other day yes replied fisher stammering but i wasn't sure that that might be enough enough yes to be sure it will i don't know what you are at nothing nothing said fisher here write upon this then said fisher putting a piece of paper into archer's hand upon which archer wrote his orders away away cried he away went fisher he returned but not until a considerable time afterwards they were at supper when he returned fisher always comes in at supper-time observed one of the greybeards carelessly well and would you have him come in after supper-time said townsend who always supplied his party with ready wit i've got the candles whispered fisher as he passed by archer to his place and the tinder-box said archer yes i got back from my aunt barbara under pretence that i must study for repetition day an hour later to-night so i got leave was not that clever a dunce always thinks it clever to cheat even by sober lies how mr fisher procured the candles and the tinder box without money and without credit we shall discover further on archer and his associates had agreed to stay the last in the schoolroom and as soon as the greybeards were gone out to bed he as the signal was to shut and lock one door townsend the other a third conspirator was to strike a light in case they should not be able to secure a candle a fourth was to take charge of the candle as soon as lighted and all the rest were to run to their bars which were secreted in a room then to fix them to the common fastening bars of the window in the manner in which they had been previously instructed by the manager thus each had his part assigned and each was warned that the success of the whole depended upon their order and punctuality order and punctuality it appears are necessary even in a barring out and even rebellion must have its laws the long expected moment at length arrived de grey and his friends unconscious of what was going forward walked out of the schoolroom as usual at bedtime the clock began to strike nine there was one greybeard left in the room who was packing up some of his books which had been left about by accident it is impossible to describe the impatience with which he was watched especially by fisher and the nine who depended upon the gipsy oracle when he had got all his books together under his arm he let one of them fall and whilst he stooped to pick it up archer gave the signal the doors were shut locked and double-locked in an instant a light was struck and each ran to his post the bars were all in the same moment put up to the windows and archer when he had tried them all and seen that they were secure gave a loud huzza -- in which he was joined by all the party most manfully -- by all but the poor greybeard who the picture of astonishment stood stock still in the midst of them with his books under his arm at which spectacle townsend who enjoyed the frolic of the fray more than anything else burst into an immoderate fit of laughter so my little greybeard said he holding a candle full in his eyes what think you of all this -- how came you amongst the wicked ones i don't know indeed said the little boy very gravely you shut me up amongst you won't you let me out let you out no no my little greybeard said archer catching hold of him and dragging him to the window bars look ye here -- touch these- -put your hand to them -- pull push kick -- put a little spirit into it man -- kick like an archer if you can away with ye it's a pity that the king of the greybeards is not here to admire me i should like to show him our fortifications but come my merry men all now to the feast out with the table into the middle of the room good cheer my jolly archers i'm your manager townsend delighted with the bustle rubbed his hands and capered about the room whilst the preparations for the feast were hurried forward four candles -- four candles on the table let's have things in style when we are about it mr manager cried townsend places -- places there's nothing like a fair scramble my boys let everyone take care of himself hallo greybeard i've knocked greybeard down here in the scuffle get up again my lad and see a little life no no cried fisher he sha'n't sup with us no no cried the manager he shan't live with us a greybeard is not fit company for archers no no cried townsend evil communication corrupts good manners so with one unanimous hiss they hunted the poor little gentle boy into a corner and having pent him up with benches fisher opened his books for him which he thought the greatest mortification and set up a candle beside him -- there now he looks like a greybeard as he is cried they tell me what's the latin for cold roast beef said fisher exultingly and they returned to their feast long and loud they revelled they had a few bottles of cider give me the corkscrew the cider sha'n't be kept till it's sour cried townsend in answer to the manager who when he beheld the provisions vanishing with surprising rapidity began to fear for the morrow hang to- morrow cried townsend let greybeards think of to-morrow mr manager here's your good health the archers all stood up as their cups were filled to drink the health of their chief with a universal cheer but at the moment that the cups were at their lips and as archer bowed to thank the company a sudden shower from above astonished the whole assembly they looked up and beheld the rose of a watering-engine whose long neck appeared through a trap door in the ceiling your good health mr manager said a voice which was known to be the gardener's and in the midst of their surprise and dismay the candles were suddenly extinguished the trap-door shut down and they were left in utter darkness the devil said archer don't swear mr manager said the same voice from the ceiling i hear every word you say mercy upon us exclaimed fisher the clock added he whispering must have been wrong for it had not done striking when we began only you remember archer it had just done before you had done locking your door hold your tongue blockhead said archer well boys were ye never in the dark before you are not afraid of a shower of rain i hope is anybody drowned no said they with a faint laugh but what shall we do here in the dark all night long and all day to-morrow we can't unbar the shutters it's a wonder nobody ever thought of the trap-door said townsend the trap-door had indeed escaped the manager's observation as the house was new to him and the ceiling being newly white-washed the opening was scarcely perceptible vexed to be out-generalled and still more vexed to have it remarked archer poured forth a volley of incoherent exclamations and reproaches against those who were thus so soon discouraged by a trifle and groping for the tinder-box he asked if anything could be easier than to strike a light again the light appeared but at the moment that it made the tinder-box visible another shower from above aimed and aimed exactly at the tinder-box drenched it with water and rendered it totally unfit for further service archer in a fury dashed it to the ground and now for the first time he felt what it was to be the unsuccessful head of a party he heard in his turn the murmurs of a discontented changeable populace and recollecting all his bars and bolts and ingenious contrivances he was more provoked at their blaming him for this one only oversight than he was grieved at the disaster itself lucifer matches were then unknown -- ed oh my hair is all wet cried one dolefully wring it then said archer my hand's cut with your broken glass cried another glass cried a third mercy is there broken glass and it's all about i suppose amongst the supper and i had but one bit of bread all the time bread cried archer eat if you want it here's a piece here and no glass near it it's all wet and i don't like dry bread by itself that's no feast heigh-day what nothing but moaning and grumbling if these are the joys of a barring out cried townsend i'd rather be snug in my bed i expected that we should have sat up till twelve o'clock talking and laughing and singing so you may still what hinders you said archer sing and we'll join you and i should be glad those fellows overhead heard us singing begin townsend -- 'come now all ye social powers spread your influence o'er us' -- or else -- 'rule britannia britannia rules the waves britons never will be slaves ' nothing can be more melancholy than forced merriment in vain they roared in chorus in vain they tried to appear gay it would not do the voices died away and dropped off one by one they had each provided himself with a great-coat to sleep upon but now in the dark there was a peevish scrambling contest for the coats and half the company in very bad humour stretched themselves upon the benches for the night there is great pleasure in bearing anything that has the appearance of hardship as long as there is any glory to be acquired by it but when people feel themselves foiled there is no further pleasure in endurance and if in their misfortune there is any mixture of the ridiculous the motives for heroism are immediately destroyed dr middleton had probably considered this in the choice he made of his first attack archer who had spent the night as a man who had the cares of government upon his shoulders rose early in the morning whilst everybody else was fast asleep in the night he had resolved the affair of the trap-door and a new danger had alarmed him it was possible that the enemy might descend upon them through the trap-door the room had been built high to admit a free circulation of air it was twenty feet so that it was in vain to think of reaching to the trap-door as soon as the daylight appeared archer rose softly that he might reconnoitre and devise some method of guarding against this new danger luckily there were round holes in the top of the window-shutters which admitted sufficient light for him to work by the remains of the soaked feast wet candles and broken glass spread over the table in the middle of the room looked rather dismal this morning 'a pretty set of fellows i have to manage said archer contemplating the group of sleepers before him it is well they have somebody to think for them now if i wanted -- which thank goodness i don't -- but if i did want to call a cabinet council to my assistance whom could i pitch upon not this stupid snorer who is dreaming of gipsies if he is dreaming of anything continued archer as he looked into fisher's open mouth this next chap is quick enough but then he is so fond of having everything his own way and this curl pated monkey who is grinning in his sleep is all tongue and no brains here are brains though nobody would think it in this lump said he looking at a fat rolled up heavy breathing sleeper but what signify brains to such a lazy dog i might kick him for my football this half hour before i should get him awake this lank jawed harlequin beside him is a handy fellow to be sure but then if he has hands he has no head -- and he'd be afraid of his own shadow too by this light he is such a coward and townsend why he has puns in plenty but when there's any work to be done he's the worst fellow to be near one in the world -- he can do nothing but laugh at his own puns this poor little fellow that we hunted into the corner has more sense than all of them put together but then he is a greybeard thus speculated the chief of a party upon his sleeping friends and how did it happen that he should be so ambitious to please and govern this set when for each individual of which it was composed he felt such supreme contempt he had formed them into a party had given them a name and he was at their head if these be not good reasons none better can be assigned for archer's conduct i wish ye could all sleep on said he but i must waken ye though you will be only in my way the sound of my hammering must waken them so i may as well do the thing handsomely and flatter some of them by pretending to ask their advice accordingly he pulled two or three to waken them come townsend waken my boy here's some diversion for you -- up up diversion cried townsend i'm your man i'm up -- up to anything so under the name of diversion archer set townsend to work at four o'clock in the morning they had nails a few tools and several spars still left from the wreck of the playhouse these by archer's directions they sharpened at one end and nailed them to the ends of several forms all hands were now called to clear away the supper things to erect these forms perpendicularly under the trap-door and with the assistance of a few braces a chevaux-de-frise was formed upon which nobody could venture to descend at the farthest end of the room they likewise formed a penthouse of the tables under which they proposed to breakfast secure from the pelting storm if it should again assail them through the trap- door they crowded under the penthouse as soon as it was ready and their admiration of its ingenuity paid the workmen for the job lord i shall like to see the gardener's phiz through the trap-door when he beholds the spikes under him cried townsend now for breakfast ay now for breakfast said archer looking at his watch past eight o'clock and my town boys not come i don't understand this archer had expected a constant supply of provisions from two boys who lived in the town who were cousins of his and who had promised to come every day and put food in at a certain hole in the wall in which a ventilator usually turned this ventilator archer had taken down and had contrived it so that it could be easily removed and replaced at pleasure but upon examination it was now perceived that the hole had been newly stopped up by an iron back which it was impossible to penetrate or remove it never came into my head that anybody would ever have thought of the ventilator but myself exclaimed archer in great perplexity he listened and waited for his cousins but no cousins came and at a late hour the company were obliged to breakfast upon the scattered fragments of the last night's feast that feast had been spread with such imprudent profusion that little now remained to satisfy the hungry guests archer who well knew the effect which the apprehension of a scarcity would have upon his associates did everything that could be done by a bold countenance and reiterated assertions to persuade them that his cousins would certainly come at last and that the supplies were only delayed the delay however was alarming fisher alone heard the manager's calculations and saw the public fears unmoved secretly rejoicing in his own wisdom he walked from window to window slily listening for the gipsy's signal there it is cried he with more joy sparkling in his eyes than had ever enlightened them before come this way archer but don't tell anybody hark do ye hear those three taps at the window this is the old woman with twelve buns for me i'll give you one whole one for yourself if you will unbar the window for me unbar the window interrupted archer no that i won't for you or the gipsy either but i have heard enough to get your buns without that but stay there is something of more consequence than your twelve buns i must think for ye all i see regularly so he summoned a council and proposed that everyone should subscribe and trust the subscription to the gipsy to purchase a fresh supply of provisions archer laid down a guinea of his own money for his subscription at which sight all the company clapped their hands and his popularity rose to a high pitch with their renewed hopes of plenty now having made a list of their wants they folded the money in the paper put it into a bag which archer tied to a long string and having broken the pane of glass behind the round hole in the window-shutter he let down the bag to the gipsy she promised to be punctual and having filled the bag with fisher's twelve buns they were drawn up in triumph and everybody anticipated the pleasure with which they should see the same bag drawn up at dinner-time the buns were a little squeezed in being drawn through the hole in the window-shutter but archer immediately sawed out a piece of the shutter and broke the corresponding panes in each of the other windows to prevent suspicion and to make it appear that they had all been broken to admit air what a pity that so much ingenuity should have been employed to no purpose it may have surprised the intelligent reader that the gipsy was so punctual to her promise to fisher but we must recollect that her apparent integrity was only cunning she was punctual that she might be employed again that she might be intrusted with the contribution which she foresaw must be raised amongst the famishing garrison no sooner had she received the money than her end was gained dinner-time came it struck three four five six they listened with hungry ears but no signal was heard the morning had been very long and archer had in vain tried to dissuade them from devouring the remainder of the provisions before they were sure of a fresh supply and now those who had been the most confident were the most impatient of their disappointment archer in the division of the food had attempted by the most scrupulous exactness to content the public and he was both astonished and provoked to perceive that his impartiality was impeached so differently do people judge in different situations he was the first person to accuse his master of injustice and the least capable of bearing such an imputation upon himself from others he now experienced some of the joys of power and the delight of managing unreasonable numbers have not i done everything i could to please you have not i spent my money to buy you food have not i divided the last morsel with you i have not tasted one mouthful today did not i set to work for you at sunrise did not i lie awake all night for you have not i had all the labour and all the anxiety look round and see my contrivances my work my generosity and after all you think me a tyrant because i want you to have common sense is not this bun which i hold in my hand my own did not i earn it by my own ingenuity from that selfish dunce pointing to fisher who could never have gotten one of his twelve buns if i had not shown him how eleven of them he has eaten since morning for his own share without offering anyone a morsel but i scorn to eat even what is justly my own when i see so many hungry creatures longing for it i was not going to touch this last morsel myself i only begged you to keep it till supper-time when perhaps you'll want it more and townsend who can't bear the slightest thing that crosses his own whims and who thinks there's nothing in this world to be minded but his own diversion calls me a tyrant you all of you promised to obey me the first thing i ask you to do for your own good and when if you had common sense you must know i can want nothing but your good you rebel against me traitors fools ungrateful fools archer walked up and down unable to command his emotion whilst for the moment the discontented multitude was silenced here said he striking his hand upon the little boy's shoulder here's the only one amongst you who has not uttered one word of reproach or complaint and he has had but one bit of bread -- a bit that i gave him myself this day here said he snatching the bun which nobody had dared to touch take it -- it's mine -- i give it to you though you are a greybeard you deserve it eat it and be an archer you shall be my captain will you said he lifting him up in his arm above the rest i like you now said the little boy courageously but i love de grey better he has always been my friend and he advised me never to call myself any of those names archer or greybeard so i won't though i am shut in here i have nothing to do with it i love dr middleton he was never unjust to me and i daresay that he has very good reasons as de grey said for forbidding us to go into that house besides it's his own instead of admiring the good sense and steadiness of this little lad archer suffered townsend to snatch the untasted bun out of his hands he flung it at a hole in the window but it fell back the archers scrambled for it and fisher ate it archer saw this and was sensible that he had not done handsomely in suffering it a few moments ago he had admired his own generosity and though he had felt the injustice of others he had not accused himself of any he turned away from the little boy and sitting down at one end of the table hid his face in his hands he continued immovable in this posture for some time lord said townsend it was an excellent joke pooh said fisher what a fool to think so much about a bun never mind mr archer if you are thinking about me said the little boy trying gently to pull his hands from his face archer stooped down and lifted him up upon the table at which sight the partisans set up a general hiss he has forsaken us he deserts his party he wants to be a greybeard after he has got us all into this scrape he will leave us i am not going to leave you cried archer no one shall ever accuse me of deserting my party i'll stick by the archers right or wrong i tell you to the last moment but this little fellow -- take it as you please mutiny if you will and throw me out of the window call me traitor coward greybeard -- this little fellow is worth you all put together and i'll stand by him against anyone who dares to lay a finger upon him and the next morsel of food that i see shall be his touch him who dares the commanding air with which archer spoke and looked and the belief that the little boy deserved his protection silenced the crowd but the storm was only hushed no sound of merriment was now to be heard -- no battledore and shuttlecock- -no ball no marbles some sat in a corner whispering their wishes that archer would unbar the doors and give up others stretching their arms and gaping as they sauntered up and down the room wished for air or food or water fisher and his nine who had such firm dependence upon the gipsy now gave themselves up to utter despair it was eight o'clock growing darker and darker every minute and no candles no light could they have the prospect of another long dark night made them still more discontented townsend at the head of the yawners and fisher at the head of the hungry malcontents gathered round archer and the few yet unconquered spirits demanding how long he meant to keep them in this dark dungeon and whether he expected that they should starve themselves for his sake the idea of giving up was more intolerable to archer than all the rest he saw that the majority his own convincing argument was against him he was therefore obliged to condescend to the arts of persuasion he flattered some with hopes of food from the town boys some he reminded of their promises others he praised for former prowess and others he shamed by the repetition of their high vaunts in the beginning of the business it was at length resolved that at all events they would hold out with this determination they stretched themselves again to sleep for the second night in weak and weary obstinacy archer slept longer and more soundly than usual the next morning and when he awoke he found his hands tied behind him three or four boys had just got hold of his feet which they pressed down whilst the trembling hands of fisher were fastening the cord round them with all the force which rage could inspire archer struggled and roared to his archers -- his friends his party -- for help against the traitors but all kept aloof townsend in particular stood laughing and looking on i beg your pardon archer but really you look so droll all alive and kicking don't be angry i'm so weak i cannot help laughing today the packthread cracked his hands are free he's loose cried the least of the boys and ran away whilst archer leaped up and seizing hold of fisher with a powerful grasp sternly demanded what he meant by this ask my party said fisher terrified they set me on ask my party your party cried archer with a look of ineffable contempt you reptile -- your party can such a thing as you have a party to be sure said fisher settling his collar which archer in his surprise had let go to be sure why not any man who chooses it may have a party as well as yourself i suppose i have nine fishermen at these words spoken with much sullen importance archer in spite of his vexation could not help laughing fishermen cried he fishermen and why not fishermen as well as archers cried they one party is just as good as another it is only a question which can get the upper hand and we had your hands tied just now that's right townsend said archer laugh on my boy friend or foe it's all the same to you i know how to value your friendship now you are a mighty good fellow when the sun shines but let a storm come and how you slink away at this instant archer felt the difference between a good companion and a good friend a difference which some people do not discover till late in life have i no friend -- no real friend amongst you all and could ye stand by and see my hands tied behind me like a thief's what signifies such a party -- all mute we want something to eat answered the fishermen what signifies such a party indeed and such a manager who can do nothing for one and have i done nothing don't let's hear any more prosing said fisher we are too many for you i've advised my party if they've a mind not to be starved to give you up for the ringleader as you were and dr middleton will not let us all off i daresay so depending upon the sullen silence of the assembly he again approached archer with a cord a cry of no no no don't tie him was feebly raised archer stood still but the moment fisher touched him he knocked him down to the ground and turning to the rest with eyes sparkling with indignation archers cried he a voice at this instant was heard at the door it was de grey's voice i have got a large basket of provisions for your breakfast a general shout of joy was sent forth by the voracious public breakfast provisions a large basket de grey for ever huzza de grey promised upon his honour that if he would unbar the door nobody should come in with him and no advantage should be taken of them this promise was enough even for archer i will let him in said he myself for i'm sure he'll never break his word he pulled away the bar the door opened and having bargained for the liberty of melson the little boy who had been shut in by mistake de grey entered with his basket of provisions when he locked and barred the door instantly joy and gratitude sparkled in every face when he unpacked his basket and spread the table with a plentiful breakfast a hundred questions were asked him at once eat first said he and we will talk afterwards this business was quickly despatched by those who had not tasted food for a long while their curiosity increased as their hunger diminished who sent us breakfast does dr middleton know were questions reiterated from every mouth he does know answered de grey and the first thing i have to tell you is that i am your fellow-prisoner i am to stay here till you give up this was the only condition on which dr middleton would allow me to bring you food and he will allow no more everyone looked at the empty basket but archer in whom half vanquished party spirit revived with the strength he had got from his breakfast broke into exclamations in praise of de grey's magnanimity as he now imagined that de grey had become one of themselves and you will join us will you that's a noble fellow no answered de grey calmly but i hope to persuade or rather to convince you that you ought to join me you would have found it no hard task to have persuaded or convinced us whichever you pleased said townsend if you had appealed to archers fasting but archers feasting are quite other animals even caesar himself after breakfast is quite another thing added he pointing to archer you may speak for yourself mr townsend replied the insulted hero but not for me or for archers in general if you please we unbarred the door upon the faith of de grey's promise -- that was not giving up and it would have been just as difficult i promise you to persuade or convince me either that i should give up against my honour before breakfast as after this spirited speech was applauded by many who had now forgotten the feelings of famine not so fisher whose memory was upon this occasion very distinct what nonsense and the orator paused for a synonymous expression but none was at hand what nonsense and -- nonsense is here why don't you remember that dinner-time and supper-time and breakfast-time will come again so what signifies mouthing about persuading and convincing we will not go through again what we did yesterday honour me no honour i don't understand it i'd rather be flogged at once as i have been many's the good time for a less thing i say we'd better all be flogged at once which must be the end of it sooner or later than wait here to be without dinner breakfast and supper all only because mr archer won't give up because of his honour and nonsense many prudent faces amongst the fishermen seemed to deliberate at the close of this oration in which the arguments were brought so home to each man's business and bosom but said de grey when we yield i hope it will not be merely to get our dinner gentlemen when we yield archer -- don't address yourself to me interrupted archer struggling with his pride you have no further occasion to try to win me i have no power no party you see and now i find that i have no friends i don't care what becomes of myself i suppose i'm to be given up as a ringleader here's this fisher and a party of his fishermen were going to tie me hand and foot if i had not knocked him down just as you came to the door de grey and now perhaps you will join fisher's party against me de grey was going to assure him that he had no intention of joining any party when a sudden change appeared on archer's countenance silence cried archer in an imperious tone and there was silence someone was heard to whistle the beginning of a tune that was perfectly new to everybody present except to archer who immediately whistled the conclusion there cried he looking at de grey with triumph that's a method of holding secret correspondence whilst a prisoner which i learned from 'richard coeur de lion ' i know how to make use of everything hallo friend are you there at last cried he going to the ventilator yes but we are barred out here round to the window then and fill our bag we'll let it down my lad in a trice bar me out who can archer let down the bag with all the expedition of joy and it was filled with all the expedition of fear pull away make haste for heaven's sake said the voice from without the gardener will come from dinner else and we shall be caught he mounted guard all yesterday at the ventilator and though i watched and watched till it was darker than pitch i could not get near you i don't know what has taken him out of the way now make haste pull away the heavy bag was soon pulled up have you any more said archer yes plenty let down quick i've got the tailor's bag full which is three times as large as yours and i've changed clothes with the tailor's boy so nobody took notice of me as i came down the street there's my own cousin exclaimed archer there's a noble fellow there's my own cousin i acknowledge fill the bag then several times the bag descended and ascended and at every unlading of the crane fresh acclamations were heard i have no more at length the boy with the tailor's bag cried off with you then we've enough and thank you a delightful review was now made of their treasure busy hands arranged and sorted the heterogeneous mass archer in the height of his glory looked on the acknowledged master of the whole townsend who in his prosperity as in adversity saw and enjoyed the comic foibles of his friends pushed de grey who was looking on with a more good-natured and more thoughtful air friend said he you look like a great philosopher and archer a great hero and you townsend said archer may look like a wit if you will but you will never be a hero no no replied townsend wits were never heroes because they are wits you are out of your wits and therefore may set up for a hero laugh and welcome i'm not a tyrant i don't want to restrain anybody's wit but i cannot say i admire puns nor i either said the time serving fisher sidling up to the manager and picking the ice off a piece of plum-cake nor i either i hate puns i can never understand townsend's puns besides anybody can make puns and one doesn't want wit either at all times for instance when one is going to settle about dinner or business of consequence bless us all archer continued he with sudden familiarity what a sight of good things are here i'm sure we are much obliged to you and your cousin i never thought he'd have come why now we can hold out as long as you please let us see said he dividing the provisions upon the table we can hold out to-day and all to-morrow and part of next day maybe why now we may defy the doctor and the greybeards the doctor will surely give up to us for you see he knows nothing of all this and he'll think we are starving all this while and he'd be afraid you see to let us starve quite in reality for three whole days because of what would be said in the town my aunt barbara for one would be at him long before that time was out and besides you know in that case he'd be hanged for murder which is quite another thing in law from a barring out you know archer had not given to this harangue all the attention which it deserved for his eye was fixed upon de grey what is de grey thinking of he asked impatiently i am thinking said de grey that dr middleton must believe that i have betrayed his confidence in me the gardener was ordered away from his watch-post for one half-hour when i was admitted this half-hour the gardener has made nearly a hour i never would have come near you if i had foreseen all this dr middleton trusted me and now he will repent of his confidence in me de grey cried archer with energy he shall not repent of his confidence in you -- nor shall you repent of coming amongst us you shall find that we have some honour as well as yourself and i will take care of your honour as if it were my own hey-day interrupted townsend are heroes allowed to change sides pray and does the chief of the archers stand talking sentiment to the chief of the greybeards in the middle of his own party too party repeated archer disdainfully i have done with parties i see what parties are made of i have felt the want of a friend and i am determined to make one if i can that you may do said de grey stretching out his hand unbar the doors unbar the windows exclaimed archer away with all these things i give up for de grey's sake he shall not lose his credit on my account no said de grey you shall not give up for my sake well then i'll give up to do what is honourable said archer why not to do what is reasonable said de grey reasonable oh the first thing that a man of spirit should think of is what is honourable but how will he find out what is honourable unless he can reason replied de grey oh said archer his own feelings always tell him what is honourable have not your feelings asked de grey changed within these few hours yes with circumstances replied archer but right or wrong as long as i think it honourable to do so and so i'm satisfied but you cannot think anything honourable or the contrary observed de grey without reasoning and as to what you call feeling it's only a quick sort of reasoning the quicker the better said archer perhaps not said de grey we are apt to reason best when we are not in quite so great a hurry but said archer we have not always time enough to reason at first you must however acknowledge replied de grey smiling that no man but a fool thinks it honourable to be in the wrong at last is it not therefore best to begin by reasoning to find out the right at first to be sure said archer and did you reason with yourself at first and did you find out that it was right to bar dr middleton out of his own schoolroom because he desired you not to go into one of his own houses no replied archer but i should never have thought of heading a barring out if he had not shown partiality and if you had flown into a passion with me openly at once for pulling down your scenery which would have been quite natural and not have gone slily and forbid us the house out of revenge there would have been none of this work why said de grey should you suspect me of such a mean action when you have never seen or known me do anything mean and when in this instance you have no proofs will you give me your word and honour now de grey before everybody here that you did not do what i suspected i do assure you upon my honour i never indirectly spoke to dr middleton about the playhouse then said archer i'm as glad as if i had found a thousand pounds now you are my friend indeed and dr middleton -- why should you suspect him without reason any more than me as to that said archer he is your friend and you are right to defend him and i won't say another word against him will that satisfy you not quite not quite then indeed you are unreasonable no replied de grey for i don't wish you to yield out of friendship to me any more than to honour if you yield to reason you will be governed by reason another time well but then don't triumph over me because you have the best side of the argument not i how can i said de grey for now you are on the best side as well as myself are not you so we may triumph together you are a good friend said archer and with great eagerness he pulled down the fortifications whilst every hand assisted the room was restored to order in a few minutes -- the shutters were thrown open the cheerful light let in the windows were thrown up and the first feeling of the fresh air was delightful the green playgound opened before them and the hopes of exercise and liberty brightened the countenances of these voluntary prisoners but alas they were not yet at liberty the idea of dr middleton and the dread of his vengeance smote their hearts when the rebels had sent an ambassador with their surrender they stood in pale and silent suspense waiting for their doom ah said fisher looking up at the broken panes in the windows the doctor will think the most of that -- he'll never forgive us for that hush here he comes his steady step was heard approaching nearer and nearer archer threw open the door and dr middleton entered fisher instantly fell on his knees it is no delight to me to see people on their knees stand up mr fisher i hope you are all conscious that you have done wrong sir said archer they are conscious that they have done wrong and so am i i am the ringleader punish me as you think proper i submit your punishments -- your vengeance ought to fall on me alone sir said dr middleton calmly i perceive that whatever else you may have learned in the course of your education you have not been taught the meaning of the word punishment punishment and vengeance do not with us mean the same thing punishment is pain given with the reasonable hope of preventing those on whom it is inflicted from doing in future what will hurt themselves or others vengeance never looks to the future but is the expression of anger for an injury that is past i feel no anger you have done me no injury here many of the little boys looked timidly up to the windows yes i see that you have broken my windows that is a small evil oh sir how good how merciful exclaimed those who had been most panic-struck he forgives us stay resumed dr middleton i cannot forgive you i shall never revenge but it is my duty to punish you have rebelled against the just authority which is necessary to conduct and govern you whilst you have not sufficient reason to govern and conduct yourselves without obedience to the laws added he turning to archer as men you cannot be suffered in society you sir think yourself a man i observe and you think it the part of a man not to submit to the will of another i have no pleasure in making others whether men or children submit to my will but my reason and experience are superior to yours your parents at least think so or they would not have intrusted me with the care of your education as long as they do intrust you to my care and as long as i have any hopes of making you wiser and better by punishment i shall steadily inflict it whenever i judge it to be necessary and i judge it to be necessary now this is a long sermon mr archer not preached to show my own eloquence but to convince your understanding now as to your punishment name it sir said archer whatever it is i will cheerfully submit to it name it yourself said dr middleton and show me that you now understand the nature of punishment archer proud to be treated like a reasonable creature and sorry that he had behaved like a foolish schoolboy was silent for some time but at length replied that he would rather not name his own punishment he repeated however that he trusted he should bear it well whatever it might be i shall then said dr middleton deprive you for two months of pocket-money as you have had too much and have made a bad use of it sir said archer i brought five guineas with me to school this guinea is all that i have left dr middleton received the guinea which archer offered him with a look of approbation and told him that it should be applied to the repairs of the schoolroom the rest of the boys waited in silence for the doctor's sentence against them but not with those looks of abject fear with which boys usually expect the sentence of a schoolmaster you shall return from the playground all of you said dr middleton one quarter of an hour sooner for two months to come than the rest of your companions a bell shall ring at the appointed time i give you an opportunity of recovering my confidence by your punctuality oh sir we will come the instant the very instant the bell rings you shall have confidence in us cried they eagerly i deserve your confidence i hope said dr middleton for it is my first wish to make you all happy you do not know the pain that it has cost me to deprive you of food for so many hours here the boys with one accord ran to the place where they had deposited their last supplies archer delivered them up to the doctor proud to show that they were not reduced to obedience merely by necessity the reason resumed dr middleton having now returned to the usual benignity of his manner -- the reason why i desired that none of you should go to that building pointing out of the window was this -- i had been informed that a gang of gipsies had slept there the night before i spoke to you one of whom was dangerously ill of a putrid fever i did not choose to mention my reason to you or your friends i have had the place cleaned and you may return to it when you please the gipsies were yesterday removed from the town de grey you were in the right whispered archer and it was i that was unjust the old woman continued the doctor whom you employed to buy food has escaped the fever but she has not escaped a gaol whither she was sent yesterday for having defrauded you of your money mr fisher said dr middleton as to you i shall not punish you i have no hope of making you either wiser or better do you know this paper -- the paper appeared to be a bill for candles and a tinder-box i desired him to buy those things sir said archer colouring and did you desire him not to pay for them no said archer he had half a crown on purpose to pay for them i know he had but he chose to apply it to his private use and gave it to the gipsy to buy twelve buns for his own eating to obtain credit for the tinder-box and candles he made use of this name said he turning to the other side of the bill and pointing to de grey's name which was written at the end of a copy of one of de grey's exercises i assure you sir -- cried archer you need not assure me sir said dr middleton i cannot suspect a boy of your temper of having any part in so base an action when the people in the shop refused to let mr fisher have the things without paying for them he made use of de grey's name who was known there suspecting some mischief however from the purchase of the tinder-box the shopkeeper informed me of the circumstance nothing in this whole business gave me half so much pain as i felt for a moment when i suspected that de grey was concerned in it a loud cry in which archer's voice was heard most distinctly declared de grey's innocence dr middleton looked round at their eager honest faces with benevolent approbation archer said he taking him by the hand i am heartily glad to see that you have got the better of your party spirit i wish you may keep such a friend as you have now beside you one such friend is worth two such parties as for you mr fisher depart you must never return hither again in vain he solicited archer and de grey to intercede for him everybody turned away with contempt and he sneaked out whimpering in a doleful voice what shall i say to my aunt barbara the bracelets in a beautiful and retired part of england lived mrs villars a lady whose accurate understanding benevolent heart and steady temper peculiarly fitted her for the most difficult as well as most important of all occupations -- the education of youth this task she had undertaken and twenty young persons were put under her care with the perfect confidence of their parents no young people could be happier they were good and gay emulous but not envious of each other for mrs villars was impartially just her praise they felt to be the reward of merit and her blame they knew to be the necessary consequence of ill- conduct to the one therefore they patiently submitted and in the other consciously rejoiced they rose with fresh cheerfulness in the morning eager to pursue their various occupations they returned in the evening with renewed ardour to their amusements and retired to rest satisfied with themselves and pleased with each other nothing so much contributed to preserve a spirit of emulation in this little society as a small honorary distinction given annually as a prize of successful application the prize this year was peculiarly dear to each individual as it was the picture of a friend whom they dearly loved it was the picture of mrs villars in a small bracelet it wanted neither gold pearls nor precious stones to give it value the two foremost candidates for this prize were cecilia and leonora cecilia was the most intimate friend of leonora but leonora was only the favourite companion of cecilia cecilia was of an active ambitious enterprising disposition more eager in the pursuit than happy in the enjoyment of her wishes leonora was of a contented unaspiring temperate character not easily roused to action but indefatigable when once excited leonora was proud cecilia was vain her vanity made her more dependent upon the approbation of others and therefore more anxious to please than leonora but that very vanity made her at the same time more apt to offend in short leonora was the most anxious to avoid what was wrong cecilia the most ambitious to do what was right few of her companions loved but many were led by cecilia for she was often successful many loved leonora but none were ever governed by her for she was too indolent to govern on the first day of may about six o'clock in the evening a great bell rang to summon this little society into a hall where the prize was to be decided a number of small tables were placed in a circle in the middle of the hall seats for the young competitors were raised one above another in a semicircle some yards distant from the table and the judges' chairs under canopies of lilacs and laburnums forming another semicircle closed the amphitheatre everyone put their writings their drawings their works of various kinds upon the tables appropriated for each how unsteady were the last steps to these tables how each little hand trembled as it laid down its claims till this moment everyone thought herself secure of success and the heart which exulted with hope now palpitated with fear the works were examined the preference adjudged and the prize was declared to be the happy cecilia's mrs villars came forward smiling with the bracelet in her hand cecilia was behind her companions on the highest row all the others gave way and she was on the floor in an instant mrs villars clasped the bracelet on her arm the clasp was heard through the whole hall and a universal smile of congratulation followed mrs villars kissed cecilia's little hand and now said she go and rejoice with your companions the remainder of the day is yours oh you whose hearts are elated with success whose bosoms beat high with joy in the moment of triumph command yourselves let that triumph be moderate that it may be lasting consider that though you are good you may be better and though wise you may be weak as soon as mrs villars had given her the bracelet all cecilia's little companions crowded round her and they all left the hall in an instant she was full of spirits and vanity she ran on running down the flight of steps which led to the garden in her violent haste cecilia threw down the little louisa who had a china mandarin in her hand which her mother had sent her that very morning and which was all broken to pieces by her fall oh my mandarin cried louisa bursting into tears the crowd behind cecilia suddenly stopped louisa sat on the lowest step fixing her eyes upon the broken pieces then turning round she hid her face in her hands upon the step above her in turning louisa threw down the remains of the mandarin the head which she placed in the socket fell from the shoulders and rolled bounding along the gravel walk cecilia pointed to the head and to the socket and burst into laughter the crowd behind laughed too at any other time they would have been more inclined to cry with louisa but cecilia had just been successful and sympathy with the victorious often makes us forget justice leonora however preserved her usual consistency poor louisa said she looking first at her and then reproachfully at cecilia cecilia turned sharply round colouring half with shame and half with vexation i could not help it leonora said she but you could have helped laughing cecilia i didn't laugh at louisa and i surely may laugh for it does nobody any harm i am sure however replied leonora i should not have laughed if i had -- no to be sure you wouldn't because louisa is your favourite i can buy her another mandarin when the old peddler comes to the door if that's all i can do no more can i said she again turning round to her companions no to be sure said they that's all fair cecilia looked triumphantly at leonora leonora let go her hand she ran on and the crowd followed when she got to the end of the garden she turned round to see if leonora had followed her too but was vexed to see her still sitting on the steps with louisa i'm sure i can do no more than buy her another can i said she again appealing to her companions no to be sure said they eager to begin their play how many games did these juvenile playmates begin and leave off before cecilia could be satisfied with any her thoughts were discomposed and her mind was running upon something else no wonder then that she did not play with her usual address she grew still more impatient she threw down the ninepins come let us play at something else -- at threading the needle said she holding out her hand they all yielded to the hand which wore the bracelet but cecilia dissatisfied with herself was discontented with everybody else her tone grew more and more peremptory one was too rude another too stiff one too slow another too quick in short everything went wrong and everybody was tired of her humours the triumph of success is absolute but short cecilia's companions at length recollected that though she had embroidered a tulip and painted a peach better than they yet that they could play as well and keep their tempers better for she was discomposed walking towards the house in a peevish mood cecilia met leonora but passed on cecilia cried leonora well what do you want with me are we friends you know best said cecilia we are if you will let me tell louisa that you are sorry -- cecilia interrupting her oh pray let me hear no more about louisa what not confess that you were in the wrong oh cecilia i had a better opinion of you your opinion is of no consequence to me now for you don't love me no not when you are unjust cecilia unjust i am not unjust and if i were you are not my governess no but am not i your friend i don't desire to have such a friend who would quarrel with me for happening to throw down little louisa how could i tell that she had a mandarin in her hand and when it was broken could i do more than promise her another was that unjust but you know cecilia -- i know ironically i know leonora that you love louisa better than you love me that's the injustice if i did replied leonora gravely it would be no injustice if she deserved it better how can you compare louisa to me exclaimed cecilia indignantly leonora made no answer for she was really hurt at her friend's conduct she walked on to join the rest of her companions they were dancing in a round upon the grass leonora declined dancing but they prevailed upon her to sing for them her voice was not so sprightly but it was sweeter than usual who sang so sweetly as leonora or who danced so nimbly as louisa away she was flying all spirits and gaiety when leonora's eyes full of tears caught hers louisa silently let go her companion's hand and quitting the dance ran up to leonora to inquire what was the matter with her nothing replied she that need interrupt you go my dear go and dance again louisa immediately ran away to her garden and pulling off her little straw hat she lined it with the freshest strawberry-leaves and was upon her knees before the strawberry-bed when cecilia came by cecilia was not disposed to be pleased with louisa at that instant for two reasons because she was jealous of her and because she had injured her the injury however louisa had already forgotten perhaps to tell things just as they were she was not quite so much inclined to kiss cecilia as she would have been before the fall of her mandarin but this was the utmost extent of her malice if it can be called malice what are you doing there little one said cecilia in a sharp tone are you eating your early strawberries here all alone no said louisa mysteriously i am not eating them what are you doing with them can't you answer then i'm not playing with you child oh as to that cecilia you know i need not answer you unless i choose it not but what i would if you would only ask me civilly and if you would not call me child why should not i call you child because -- because -- i don't know but i wish you would stand out of my light cecilia for you are trampling upon all my strawberries i have not touched one you covetous little creature indeed -- indeed cecilia i am not covetous i have not eaten one of them they are all for your friend leonora see how unjust you are unjust that's a cant word which you learnt of my friend leonora as you call her but she is not my friend now not your friend now exclaimed louisa then i am sure you must have done something very naughty how cried cecilia catching hold of her let me go let me go cried louisa struggling i won't give you one of my strawberries for i don't like you at all you don't don't you cried cecilia provoked and catching the hat from louisa she flung the strawberries over the hedge will nobody help me exclaimed louisa snatching her hat again and running away with all her force what have i done said cecilia recollecting herself louisa louisa she called very loud but louisa would not turn back she was running to her companions who were still dancing hand in hand upon the grass whilst leonora sitting in the middle was singing to them stop stop and hear me cried louisa breaking through them and rushing up to leonora she threw her hat at her feet and panting for breath -- it was full -- almost full of my own strawberries said she the first i ever got out of my garden they should all have been for you leonora but now i have not one left they are all gone said she and she hid her face in leonora's lap gone gone where said everyone at once running up to her cecilia cecilia said she sobbing cecilia repeated leonora what of cecilia yes it was -- it was come with me said leonora unwilling to have her friend exposed come and i will get you some more strawberries oh i don't mind the strawberries indeed but i wanted to have had the pleasure of giving them to you leonora took her up in her arms to carry her away but it was too late what cecilia cecilia who won the prize it could not surely be cecilia whispered every busy tongue at this instant the bell summoned them in there she is there she is cried they pointing to an arbour where cecilia was standing ashamed and alone and as they passed her some lifted up their hands and eyes with astonishment others whispered and huddled mysteriously together as if to avoid her leonora walked on her head a little higher than usual leonora said cecilia timorously as she passed oh cecilia who would have thought that you had a bad heart cecilia turned her head aside and burst into tears oh no indeed she has not a bad heart cried louisa running up to her and throwing her arms around her neck she's very sorry are not you cecilia but don't cry any more for i forgive you with all my heart -- and i love you now though i said i did not when i was in a passion oh you sweet-tempered girl how i love you said cecilia kissing her well then if you do come along with me and dry your eyes for they are so red go my dear and i'll come presently then i will keep a place for you next to me but you must make haste or you will have to come in when we have all sat down to supper and then you will be so stared at so don't stay now cecilia followed louisa with her eyes till she was out of sight and is louisa said she to herself the only one who would stop to pity me mrs villars told me that this day should be mine she little thought how it would end saying these words cecilia threw herself down upon the ground her arm leaned upon a heap of turf which she had raised in the morning and which in the pride and gaiety of her heart she had called her throne at this instant mrs villars came out to enjoy the serenity of the evening and passing by the arbour where cecilia lay she started cecilia rose hastily who is there said mrs villars it is i madam and who is i cecilia why what keeps you here my dear where are your companions this is perhaps one of the happiest days of your life oh no madam said cecilia hardly able to repress her tears why my dear what is the matter cecilia hesitated speak my dear you know that when i ask you to tell me anything as your friend i never punish you as your governess therefore you need not be afraid to tell me what is the matter no madam i am not afraid but ashamed you asked me why i was not with my companions why madam because they have all left me and -- and what my dear and i see that they all dislike me and yet i don't know why they should for i take as much pains to please as any of them all my masters seem satisfied with me and you yourself madam were pleased this very morning to give me this bracelet and i am sure you would not have given it to anyone who did not deserve it certainly not said mrs villars you well deserve it for your application -- for your successful application the prize was for the most assiduous not for the most amiable then if it had been for the most amiable it would not have been for me mrs villars smiling -- why what do you think yourself cecilia you are better able to judge than i am i can determine whether or no you apply to what i give you to learn whether you attend to what i desire you to do and avoid what i desire you not to do i know that i like you as a pupil but i cannot know that i should like you as a companion unless i were your companion therefore i must judge of what i should do by seeing what others do in the same circumstances oh pray don't madam for then you would not love me either and yet i think you would love me for i hope that i am as ready to oblige and as good-natured as -- yes cecilia i don't doubt but that you would be very good natured to me but i'm afraid that i should not like you unless you were good- tempered too but madam by good-natured i mean good-tempered -- it's all the same thing no indeed i understand by them two very different things you are good-natured cecilia for you are desirous to oblige and serve your companions -- to gain them praise and save them from blame -- to give them pleasure and relieve them from pain but leonora is good-tempered for she can bear with their foibles and acknowledge her own without disputing about the right she sometimes yields to those who are in the wrong in short her temper is perfectly good for it can bear and forbear i wish that mine could said cecilia sighing it may replied mrs villars but it is not wishes alone which can improve us in anything turn the same exertion and perseverance which have won you the prize to-day to this object and you will meet with the same success perhaps not on the first the second or the third attempt but depend upon it that you will at last every new effort will weaken your bad habits and strengthen your good ones but you must not expect to succeed all at once i repeat it to you for habit must be counteracted by habit it would be as extravagant in us to expect that all our faults could be destroyed by one punishment were it ever so severe as it was in the roman emperor we were reading of a few days ago to wish that all the heads of his enemies were upon one neck that he might cut them off at one blow here mrs villars took cecilia by the hand and they began to walk home such was the nature of cecilia's mind that when any object was forcibly impressed on her imagination it caused a temporary suspension of her reasoning faculties hope was too strong a stimulus for her spirits and when fear did take possession of her mind it was attended with total debility her vanity was now as much mortified as in the morning it had been elated she walked on with mrs villars in silence until they came under the shade of the elm-tree walk and there fixing her eyes upon mrs villars she stopped short do you think madam said she with hesitation -- do you think madam that i have a bad heart a bad heart -- my dear why what put that into your head leonora said that i had madam and i felt ashamed when she said so but my dear how can leonora tell whether your heart be good or bad however in the first place tell me what you mean by a bad heart indeed i do not know what is meant by it madam but it is something which everybody hates and why do they hate it because they think that it will hurt them ma'am i believe and that those who have bad hearts take delight in doing mischief and that they never do anybody any good but for their own ends then the best definition said mrs villars which you can give me of a bad heart is that it is some constant propensity to hurt others and to do wrong for the sake of doing wrong yes madam but that is not all either there is still something else meant something which i cannot express -- which indeed i never distinctly understood but of which therefore i was the more afraid well then to begin with what you do understand tell me cecilia do you really think it possible to be wicked merely for the love of wickedness no human being becomes wicked all at once a man begins by doing wrong because it is or because he thinks it for his interest if he continue to do so he must conquer his sense of shame and lose his love of virtue but how can you cecilia who feel such a strong sense of shame and such an eager desire to improve imagine that you have a bad heart indeed madam i never did until everybody told me so and then i began to be frightened about it this very evening madam when i was in a passion i threw little louisa's strawberries away which i am sure i was very sorry for afterwards and leonora and everybody cried out that i had a bad heart -- but i am sure i was only in a passion very likely and when you are in a passion as you call it cecilia you see that you are tempted to do harm to others if they do not feel angry themselves they do not sympathize with you they do not perceive the motive which actuates you and then they say that you have a bad heart i daresay however when your passion is over and when you recollect yourself you are very sorry for what you have done and said are not you yes indeed madam -- very sorry then make that sorry of use to you cecilia and fix it steadily in your thoughts as you hope to be good and happy that if you suffer yourself to yield to your passion upon every occasion anger and its consequences will become familiar to your mind and in the same proportion your sense of shame will be weakened till what you began with doing from sudden impulse you will end with doing from habit and choice then you would indeed according to our definition have a bad heart oh madam i hope -- i am sure i never shall no indeed cecilia i do indeed believe that you never will on the contrary i think that you have a very good disposition and what is of infinitely more consequence to you an active desire of improvement show me that you have as much perseverance as you have candour and i shall not despair of your becoming everything that i could wish here cecilia's countenance brightened and she ran up the steps in almost as high spirits as she ran down them in the morning good-night to you cecilia said mrs villars as she was crossing the hall good-night to you madam said cecilia and she ran upstairs to bed she could not go to sleep but she lay awake reflecting upon the events of the preceding day and forming resolutions for the future at the same time that she had resolved and resolved without effect she wished to give her mind some more powerful motive ambition she knew to be its most powerful incentive have i not said she to herself already won the prize of application and cannot the same application procure me a much higher prize mrs villars said that if the prize had been promised to the most amiable it would not have been given to me perhaps it would not yesterday perhaps it might not to-morrow but that is no reason that i should despair of ever deserving it in consequence of this reasoning cecilia formed a design of proposing to her companions that they should give a prize the first of the ensuing month the lst of june to the most amiable mrs villars applauded the scheme and her companions adopted it with the greatest alacrity let the prize said they be a bracelet of our own hair and instantly their shining scissors were produced and each contributed a lock of their hair they formed the most beautiful gradation of colours from the palest auburn to the brightest black who was to have the honour of plaiting them was now the question caroline begged that she might as she could plait very neatly she said cecilia however was equally sure that she could do it much better and a dispute would have inevitably ensued if cecilia recollecting herself just as her colour rose to scarlet had not yielded -- yielded with no very good grace indeed but as well as could be expected for the first time for it is habit which confers ease and without ease even in moral actions there can be no grace the bracelet was plaited in the neatest manner by caroline finished round the edge with silver twist and on it was worked in the smallest silver letters this motto to the most amiable the moment it was completed everybody begged to try it on it fastened with little silver clasps and as it was made large enough for the eldest girls it was too large for the youngest of this they bitterly complained and unanimously entreated that it might be cut to fit them how foolish exclaimed cecilia don't you perceive that if any of you win it you have nothing to do but to put the clips a little further from the edge but if we get it we can't make it larger very true said they but you need not to have called us foolish cecilia it was by such hasty and unguarded expressions as these that cecilia offended a slight difference in the manner makes a very material one in the effect cecilia lost more love by general petulance than she could gain by the greatest particular exertions how far she succeeded in curing herself of this defect -- how far she became deserving of the bracelet and to whom the bracelet was given -- shall be told in the history of the first of june -- -- - the first of june was now arrived and all the young competitors were in a state of the most anxious suspense leonora and cecilia continued to be the foremost candidates their quarrel had never been finally adjusted and their different pretensions now retarded all thoughts of a reconciliation cecilia though she was capable of acknowledging any of her faults in public before all her companions could not humble herself in private to leonora leonora was her equal they were her inferiors and submission is much easier to a vain mind where it appears to be voluntary than when it is the necessary tribute to justice or candour so strongly did cecilia feel this truth that she even delayed making any apology or coming to any explanation with leonora until success should once more give her the palm if i win the bracelet to-day said she to herself i will solicit the return of leonora's friendship it will be more valuable to me than even the bracelet and at such a time and asked in such a manner she surely cannot refuse it to me animated with this hope of a double triumph cecilia canvassed with the most zealous activity by constant attention and exertion she had considerably abated the violence of her temper and changed the course of her habits her powers of pleasing were now excited instead of her abilities to excel and if her talents appeared less brilliant her character was acknowledged to be more amiable so great an influence upon our manners and conduct have the objects of our ambition cecilia was now if possible more than ever desirous of doing what was right but she had not yet acquired sufficient fear of doing wrong this was the fundamental error of her mind it arose in a great measure from her early education her mother died when she was very young and though her father had supplied her place in the best and kindest manner he had insensibly infused into his daughter's mind a portion of that enterprising independent spirit which he justly deemed essential to the character of her brother this brother was some years older than cecilia but he had always been the favourite companion of her youth what her father's precepts inculcated his example enforced and even cecilia's virtues consequently became such as were more estimable in a man than desirable in a female all small objects and small errors she had been taught to disregard as trifles and her impatient disposition was perpetually leading her into more material faults yet her candour in confessing these she had been suffered to believe was sufficient reparation and atonement leonora on the contrary who had been educated by her mother in a manner more suited to her sex had a character and virtues more peculiar to a female her judgment had been early cultivated and her good sense employed in the regulation of her conduct she had been habituated to that restraint which as a woman she was to expect in life and early accustomed to yield compliance in her seemed natural and graceful yet notwithstanding the gentleness of her temper she was in reality more independent than cecilia she had more reliance upon her own judgment and more satisfaction in her own approbation the uniform kindness of her manner the consistency and equality of her character had fixed the esteem and passive love of her companions by passive love we mean that species of affection which makes us unwilling to offend rather than anxious to oblige which is more a habit than an emotion of the mind for cecilia her companions felt active love for she was active in showing her love to them active love arises spontaneously in the mind after feeling particular instances of kindness without reflection on the past conduct or general character it exceeds the merits of its object and is connected with a feeling of generosity rather than with a sense of justice without determining which species of love is the most flattering to others we can easily decide which is the most agreeable feeling to our minds we give our hearts more credit for being generous than for being just and we feel more self-complacency when we give our love voluntarily than when we yield it as a tribute which we cannot withhold though cecilia's companions might not know all this in theory they proved it in practice for they loved her in a much higher proportion to her merits than they loved leonora each of the young judges were to signify their choice by putting a red or a white shell into a vase prepared for the purpose cecilia's colour was red leonora's white in the morning nothing was to be seen but these shells nothing talked of but the long expected event of the evening cecilia following leonora's example had made it a point of honour not to inquire of any individual her vote previously to their final determination they were both sitting together in louisa's room louisa was recovering from the measles everyone during her illness had been desirous of attending her but leonora and cecilia were the only two that were permitted to see her as they alone had had the distemper they were both assiduous in their care of louisa but leonora's want of exertion to overcome any disagreeable feelings of sensibility often deprived her of presence of mind and prevented her from being so constantly useful as cecilia cecilia on the contrary often made too much noise and bustle with her officious assistance and was too anxious to invent amusements and procure comforts for louisa without perceiving that illness takes away the power of enjoying them as she was sitting at the window in the morning exerting herself to entertain louisa she heard the voice of an old peddler who often used to come to the house downstairs they ran immediately to ask mrs villars' permission to bring him into the hall mrs villars consented and away cecilia ran to proclaim the news to her companions then first returning into the hall she found the peddler just unbuckling his box and taking it off his shoulders what would you be pleased to want miss said the peddler i've all kinds of tweezer-cases rings and lockets of all sorts continued he opening all the glittering drawers successively oh said cecilia shutting the drawer of lockets which tempted her most these are not the things which i want have you any china figures any mandarins alack-a-day miss i had a great stock of that same chinaware but now i'm quite out of them kind of things but i believe said he rummaging one of the deepest drawers i believe i have one left and here it is oh that is the very thing what's its price only three shillings ma'am cecilia paid the money and was just going to carry off the mandarin when the peddler took out of his great- coat pocket a neat mahogany case it was about a foot long and fastened at each end by two little clasps it had besides a small lock in the middle what is that said cecilia eagerly it's only a china figure miss which i am going to carry to an elderly lady who lives nigh hand and who is mighty fond of such things could you let me look at it and welcome miss said he and opened the case oh goodness how beautiful exclaimed cecilia it was a figure of flora crowned with roses and carrying a basket of flowers in her hand cecilia contemplated it with delight how i should like to give this to louisa said she to herself and at last breaking silence did you promise it to the old lady oh no miss i didn't promise it -- she never saw it and if so be that you'd like to take it i'd make no more words about it and how much does it cost why miss as to that i'll let you have it for half-a-guinea cecilia immediately produced the box in which she kept her treasure and emptying it upon the table she began to count the shillings alas there were but six shillings how provoking said she then i can't have it where's the mandarin oh i have it said she taking it up and looking at it with the utmost disgust is this the same that i had before yes miss the very same replied the peddler who during this time had been examining the little box out of which cecilia had taken her money -- it was of silver why ma'am said he since you've taken such a fancy to the piece if you've a mind to make up the remainder of the money i will take this here little box if you care to part with it now this box was a keepsake from leonora to cecilia no said cecilia hastily blushing a little and stretching out her hand to receive it oh miss said he returning it carelessly i hope there's no offence i meant but to serve you that's all such a rare piece of china-work has no cause to go a-begging added he then putting the flora deliberately into the case and turning the key with a jerk he let it drop into his pocket when lifting up his box by the leather straps he was preparing to depart oh stay one minute said cecilia in whose mind there had passed a very warm conflict during the peddler's harangue louisa would so like this flora said she arguing with herself besides it would be so generous in me to give it to her instead of that ugly mandarin that would be doing only common justice for i promised it to her and she expects it though when i come to look at this mandarin it is not even so good as hers was the gilding is all rubbed off so that i absolutely must buy this for her oh yes i will and she will be so delighted and then everybody will say it is the prettiest thing they ever saw and the broken mandarin will be forgotten for ever here cecilia's hand moved and she was just going to decide oh but stop said she to herself consider -- leonora gave me this box and it is a keepsake however we have now quarrelled and i dare say that she would not mind my parting with it i'm sure that i should not care if she was to give away my keepsake the smelling-bottle or the ring which i gave her then what does it signify besides is it not my own and have i not a right to do what i please with it at this moment so critical for cecilia a party of her companions opened the door she knew that they came as purchasers and she dreaded her flora's becoming the prize of some higher bidder here said she hastily putting the box into the peddler's hand without looking at it take it and give me the flora her hand trembled though she snatched it impatiently she ran by without seeming to mind any of her companions let those who are tempted to do wrong by the hopes of future gratification or the prospect of certain concealment and impunity remember that unless they are totally depraved they bear in their own hearts a monitor who will prevent their enjoying what they ill obtained in vain cecilia ran to the rest of her companions to display her present in hopes that the applause of others would restore her own self- complacency in vain she saw the flora pass in due pomp from hand to hand each vying with the other in extolling the beauty of the gift and the generosity of the giver cecilia was still displeased with herself with them and even with their praise from louisa's gratitude however she yet expected much pleasure and immediately she ran upstairs to her room in the meantime leonora had gone into the hall to buy a bodkin she had just broken hers in giving her change the peddler took out of his pocket with some halfpence the very box which cecilia had sold to him leonora did not in the least suspect the truth for her mind was above suspicion and besides she had the utmost confidence in cecilia i should like to have that box said she for it is like one of which i was very fond the peddler named the price and leonora took the box she intended to give it to little louisa on going to her room she found her asleep and she sat softly down by her bedside louisa opened her eyes i hope i didn't disturb you said leonora oh no i didn't hear you come in but what have you got there only a little box would you like to have it i bought on purpose for you as i thought perhaps it would please you because it's like that which i gave cecilia oh yes that out of which she used to give me barbary drops i am very much obliged to you i always thought that exceedingly pretty and this indeed is as like it as possible i can't unscrew it will you try leonora unscrewed it goodness exclaimed louisa this must be cecilia's box look don't you see a great l at the bottom of it leonora's colour changed yes she replied calmly i see that but it is no proof that it is cecilia's you know that i bought this box just now of the peddler that may be said louisa but i remember scratching that l with my own needle and cecilia scolded me for it too do go and ask her if she has lost her box -- do repeated louisa pulling her by the ruffle as she did not seem to listen leonora indeed did not hear for she was lost in thought she was comparing circumstances which had before escaped her attention she recollected that cecilia had passed her as she came into the hall without seeming to see her but had blushed as she passed she remembered that the peddler appeared unwilling to part with the box and was going to put it again in his pocket with the halfpence and why should he keep it in his pocket and not show it with his other things combining all these circumstances leonora had no longer any doubt of the truth for though she had honourable confidence in her friends she had too much penetration to be implicitly credulous louisa she began but at this instant she heard a step which by its quickness she knew to be cecilia's coming along the passage if you love me louisa said leonora say nothing about the box nay but why not i daresay she had lost it no my dear i'm afraid she has not louisa looked surprised but i have reasons for desiring you not to say anything about it well then i won't indeed cecilia opened the door came forward smiling as if secure of a good reception and taking the flora out of the case she placed it on the mantlepiece opposite to louisa's bed dear how beautiful cried louisa starting up yes said cecilia and guess who it's for for me perhaps said the ingenuous louisa yes take it and keep it for my sake you know that i broke your mandarin oh but this is a great deal prettier and larger than that yes i know it is and i meant that it should be so i should only have done what i was bound to do if i had only given you a mandarin well replied louisa and that would have been enough surely but what a beautiful crown of roses and then that basket of flowers they almost look as if i could smell them dear cecilia i'm very much obliged to you but i won't take it by way of payment for the mandarin you broke for i'm sure you could not help that and besides i should have broken it myself by this time you shall give it to me entirely and as your keepsake i'll keep it as long as i live louisa stopped short and coloured the word keepsake recalled the box to her mind and all the train of ideas which the flora had banished but said she looking up wistfully in cecilia's face and holding the flora doubtfully did you -- leonora who was just quitting the room turned her head back and gave louisa a look which silenced her cecilia was so infatuated with her vanity that she neither perceived leonora's sign nor louisa's confusion but continued showing off her present by placing it in various situations till at length she put it into the case and laying it down with an affected carelessness upon the bed i must go now louisa good-bye said she running up and kissing her but i'll come again presently then clapping the door after her she went but as soon as the formentation of her spirits subsided the sense of shame which had been scarcely felt when mixed with so many other sensations rose uppermost in her mind what said she to herself is it possible that i have sold what i promised to keep for ever and what leonora gave me and i have concealed it too and have been making a parade of my generosity oh what would leonora what would louisa -- what would everybody think of me if the truth were known humiliated and grieved by these reflections cecilia began to search in her own mind for some consoling idea she began to compare her conduct with that of others of her own age and at length fixing her comparison upon her brother george as the companion of whom from her infancy she had been habitually the most emulous she recollected that an almost similar circumstance had once happened to him and that he had not only escaped disgrace but had acquired glory by an intrepid confession of his fault her father's word to her brother on the occasion she also perfectly recollected come to me george he said holding out his hand you are a generous brave boy they who dare to confess their faults will make great and good men these were his words but cecilia in repeating them to herself forgot to lay that emphasis on the word men which would have placed it in contradistinction to the word women she willingly believed that the observation extended equally to both sexes and flattered herself that she should exceed her brother in merit if she owned a fault which she thought that it would be so much more difficult to confess yes but said she stopping herself how can i confess it this very evening in a few hours the prize will be decided leonora or i shall win it i have now as good a chance as leonora perhaps a better and must i give up all my hopes -- all that i have been labouring for this month past oh i never can if it were but to-morrow or yesterday or any day but this i would not hesitate but now i am almost certain of the prize and if i win it -- well why then i will -- i think i will tell all -- yes i will i am determined said cecilia here a bell summoned them to dinner leonora sat opposite to her and she was not a little surprised to see cecilia look so gay and unconstrained surely said she to herself if cecilia had done that which i suspect she would not she could not look as she does but leonora little knew the cause of her gaiety cecilia was never in higher spirits or better pleased with herself than when she had resolved upon a sacrifice or a confession must not this evening be given to the most amiable whose then will it be all eyes glanced first at cecilia and then at leonora cecilia smiled leonora blushed i see that it is not yet decided said mrs villars and immediately they ran upstairs amidst confused whisperings cecilia's voice could be distinguished far above the rest how can she be so happy said leonora to herself oh cecilia there was a time when you could not have neglected me so when we were always together the best of friends and companions our wishes tastes and pleasures the same surely she did once love me said leonora but now she is quite changed she has even sold my keepsake and she would rather win a bracelet of hair from girls whom she did not always think so much superior to leonora than have my esteem my confidence and my friendship for her whole life -- yes for her whole life for i am sure she will be an amiable woman oh that this bracelet had never been thought of or that i were certain of her winning it for i am sure that i do not wish to win it from her i would rather -- a thousand times rather -- that we were as we used to be than have all the glory in the world and how pleasing cecilia can be when she wishes to please -- how candid she is -- how much she can improve herself let me be just though she has offended me she is wonderfully improved within this last month for one fault and that against myself shall i forget all her merits as leonora said these last words she could but just hear the voices of her companions they had left her alone in the gallery she knocked softly at louisa's door come in said louisa i'm not asleep oh said she starting up with the flora in her hand the instant that the door was opened i'm so glad you are come leonora for i did so long to hear what you all were making such a noise about have you forgot that the bracelet -- oh yes is this the evening inquired leonora well here's my white shell for you said louisa i've kept it in my pocket this fortnight and though cecilia did give me this flora i still love you a great deal better i thank you louisa said leonora gratefully i will take your shell and i shall value it as long as i live but here is a red one and if you wish to show me that you love me you will give this to cecilia i know that she is particularly anxious for your preference and i am sure that she deserves it yes if i could i would choose both of you said louisa but you know i can only choose which i like the best if you mean my dear louisa said leonora that you like me the best i am very much obliged to you for indeed i wish you to love me but it is enough for me to know it in private i should not feel the least more pleasure at hearing it in public or in having it made known to all my companions especially at a time when it would give poor cecilia a great deal of pain but why should it give her pain asked louisa i don't like her for being jealous of you nay louisa surely you don't think cecilia jealous she only tries to excel and to please she is more anxious to succeed than i am it is true because she has a great deal more activity and perhaps more ambition and it would really mortify her to lose this prize -- you know that she proposed it herself it has been her object for this month past and i am sure she has taken great pains to obtain it but dear leonora why should you lose it indeed my dear it would be no loss to me and if it were i would willingly suffer it for cecilia for though we seem not to be such good friends as we used to be i love her very much and she will love me again -- i'm sure she will when she no longer fears me as a rival she will again love me as a friend here leonora heard a number of her companions running along the gallery they all knocked hastily at the door calling leonora leonora will you never come cecilia has been with us this half-hour leonora smiled well louisa said she smiling will you promise me oh i am sure by the way they speak to you that they won't give you the prize said the little louisa and the tears started into her eyes they love me though for all that said leonora and as for the prize you know whom i wish to have it leonora leonora called her impatient companions don't you hear us what are you about oh she never will take any trouble about anything said one of the party let's go away oh go go make haste cried louisa don't stay they are so angry remember then that you have promised me said leonora and she left the room during all this time cecilia had been in the garden with her companions the ambition which she had felt to win the first prize -- the prize of superior talents and superior application -- was not to be compared to the absolute anxiety which she now expressed to win this simple testimony of the love and approbation of her equals and rivals to employ her exuberant activity cecilia had been dragging branches of lilacs and laburnums roses and sweet briar to ornament the bower in which her fate was to be decided it was excessively hot but her mind was engaged and she was indefatigable she stood still at last to admire her works her companions all joined in loud applause they were not a little prejudiced in her favour by the great eagerness which she expressed to win their prize and by the great importance which she seemed to affix to the preference of each individual at last where is leonora cried one of them and immediately as we have seen they ran to call her cecilia was left alone overcome with heat and too violent exertion she had hardly strength to support herself each moment appeared to her intolerably long she was in a state of the utmost suspense and all her courage failed her even hope forsook her and hope is a cordial which leaves the mind depressed and enfeebled the time is now come said cecilia in a few moments all will be decided in a few moments -- goodness how much do i hazard if i should not win the prize how shall i confess what i have done how shall i beg leonora to forgive me i who hoped to restore my friendship to her as an honour they are gone to seek for her the moment she appears i shall be forgotten what -- what shall i do said cecilia covering her face with her hands such was cecilia's situation when leonora accompanied by her companions opened the hall door they most of them ran forwards to cecilia as leonora came into the bower she held out her hand to cecilia we are not rivals but friends i hope said she cecilia clasped her hand but she was in too great agitation to speak the table was now set in the arbour -- the vase was now placed in the middle well said cecilia eagerly who begins caroline one of her friends came forward first and then all the others successively cecilia's emotion was hardly conceivable now they are all in count them caroline one two three four the numbers are both equal there was a dead silence no they are not exclaimed cecilia pressing forward and putting a shell into a vase i have not given mine and i give it to leonora then snatching the bracelet it is yours leonora said she take it and give me back your friendship the whole assembly gave one universal clap and a general shout of applause i cannot be surprised at this from you cecilia said leonora and do you then still love me as you used to do oh leonora stop don't praise me i don't deserve this said she turning to her loudly applauding companions you will soon despise me oh leonora you will never forgive me i have deceived you i have sold -- at this instant mrs villars appeared the crowd divided she had heard all that passed from her window i applaud your generosity cecilia said she but i am to tell you that in this instance it is unsuccessful you have not it in your power to give the prize to leonora it is yours i have another vote to give to you you have forgotten louisa louisa exclaimed cecilia but surely ma'am louisa loves leonora better than she does me she commissioned me however said mrs villars to give you a red shell and you will find it in this box cecilia started and turned as pale as death it was the fatal box mrs villars produced another box she opened it it contained the flora and louisa also desired me said she to return to you this flora she put it into cecilia's hand cecilia trembled so that she could not hold it leonora caught it oh madam oh leonora exclaimed cecilia now i have no hope left i intended -- i was just going to tell -- dear cecilia said leonora you need not tell it me i know it already and i forgive you with all my heart yes i can prove to you said mrs villars that leonora has forgiven you it is she who has given you the prize it was she who persuaded louisa to give you her vote i went to see her a little while ago and perceiving by her countenance that something was the matter i pressed her to tell me what it was 'why madam ' said she 'leonora has made me promise to give my shell to cecilia now i don't love cecilia half so well as i do leonora besides i would not have cecilia think i vote for her because she gave me a flora ' whilst louisa was speaking continued mrs villars i saw this silver box lying on the bed i took it up and asked if it was not yours and how she came by it 'indeed madam ' said louisa 'i could have been almost certain that it was cecilia's but leonora gave it me and she said that she bought it of the peddler this morning if anybody else had told me so i could not have believed them because i remember the box so well but i can't help believing leonora ' but did not you ask cecilia about it said i 'no madam ' replied louisa 'for leonora forbade me i guessed her reason ' well said i give me the box and i will carry your shell in it to cecilia 'then madam ' said she 'if i must give it her pray do take the flora and return it to her first that she may not think it is for that i do it ' oh generous louisa exclaimed cecilia but indeed leonora i cannot take your shell then dear cecilia accept of mine instead of it you cannot refuse it i only follow your example as for the bracelet added leonora taking cecilia's hand i assure you i don't wish for it and you do and you deserve it no said cecilia indeed i do not deserve it next to you surely louisa deserves it best louisa oh yes louisa exclaimed everybody with one voice yes said mrs villars and let cecilia carry the bracelet to her she deserves that reward for one fault i cannot forget all your merits cecilia nor i am sure will your companions then surely not your best friend said leonora kissing her everybody present was moved they looked up to leonora with respectful and affectionate admiration oh leonora how i love you and how i wish to be like you exclaimed cecilia -- to be as good as generous rather wish cecilia interrupted mrs villars to be as just to be as strictly honourable and as invariably consistent remember that many of our sex are capable of great efforts -- of making what they call great sacrifices to virtue or to friendship but few treat their friends with habitual gentleness or uniformly conduct themselves with prudence and good sense the little merchants chapter i chi di gallina nasce convien che rozole as the old cock crows so crows the young those who have visited italy give us an agreeable picture of the cheerful industry of the children of all ages in the celebrated city of naples their manner of living and their numerous employments are exactly described in the following extract from a traveller's journal varieties of literature vol i p 299 the children are busied in various ways a great number of them bring fish for sale to town from santa lucia others are very often seen about the arsenals or wherever carpenters are at work employed in gathering up the chips and pieces of wood or by the sea-side picking up sticks and whatever else has drifted ashore which when their basket is full they carry away children of two or three years old who can scarcely crawl along upon the ground in company with boys of five or six are employed in this pretty trade hence they proceed with their baskets into the heart of the city where in several places they form a sort of little market sitting round with their stock of wood before them labourers and the lower order of citizens buy it of them to burn in the tripods for warming themselves or to use in their scanty kitchens other children carry about for sale the water of the sulphurous wells which particularly in the spring season is drunk in great abundance others again endeavour to turn a few pence by buying a small matter of fruit of pressed honey cakes and comfits and then like little peddlers offer and sell them to other children always for no more profit than that they may have their share of them free of expense it is really curious to see how an urchin whose whole stock and property consist in a board and a knife will carry about a water-melon or a half roasted gourd collect a troup of children round him set down his board and proceed to divide the fruit into small pieces among them the buyers keep a sharp look out to see that they have enough for their little piece of copper and the lilliputian tradesmen act with no less caution as the exigencies of the case may require to prevent his being cheated out of a morsel the advantages of truth and honesty and the value of a character for integrity are very early felt amongst these little merchants in their daily intercourse with each other the fair dealer is always sooner or later seen to prosper the most cunning cheat is at last detected and disgraced numerous instances of the truth of this common observation were remarked by many neapolitan children especially by those who were acquainted with the characters and history of piedro and francisco two boys originally equal in birth fortune and capacity but different in their education and consequently in their habits and conduct francisco was the son of an honest gardener who from the time he could speak taught him to love to speak the truth showed him that liars are never believed -- that cheats and thieves cannot be trusted and that the shortest way to obtain a good character is to deserve it youth and white paper as the proverb says take all impressions the boy profited much by his father's precepts and more by his example he always heard his father speak the truth and saw that he dealt fairly with everybody in all his childish traffic francisco imitating his parents was scrupulously honest and therefore all his companions trusted him -- as honest as francisco became a sort of proverb amongst them as honest as francisco repeated piedro's father when he one day heard this saying let them say so i say 'as sharp as piedro' and let us see which will go through the world best with the idea of making his son sharp he made him cunning he taught him that to make a good bargain was to deceive as to the value and price of whatever he wanted to dispose of to get as much money as possible from customers by taking advantage of their ignorance or of their confidence he often repeated his favourite proverb -- the buyer has need of a hundred eyes the seller has need but of one and he took frequent opportunities of explaining the meaning of this maxim to his son he was a fisherman and as his gains depended more upon fortune than upon prudence he trusted habitually to his good luck after being idle for a whole day he would cast his line or his nets and if he was lucky enough to catch a fine fish he would go and show it in triumph to his neighbour the gardener chi compra ha bisogna di cent' occhi chi vende n'ha assai di uno you are obliged to work all day long for your daily bread he would say look here i work but five minutes and i have not only daily bread but daily fish upon these occasions our fisherman always forgot or neglected to count the hours and days which were wasted in waiting for a fair wind to put to sea or angling in vain on the shore little piedro who used to bask in the sun upon the sea-shore beside his father and to lounge or sleep away his time in a fishing-boat acquired habits of idleness which seemed to his father of little consequence whilst he was but a child what will you do with piedro as he grows up neighbour said the gardener he is smart and quick enough but he is always in mischief scarcely a day has passed for this fortnight but i have caught him amongst my grapes i track his footsteps all over my vineyard he is but a child yet and knows no better replied the fisherman but if you don't teach him better now he is a child how will he know when he is a man said the gardener a mighty noise about a bunch of grapes truly cried the fisherman a few grapes more or less in your vineyard what does it signify i speak for your son's sake and not for the sake of my grapes said the gardener and i tell you again the boy will not do well in the world neighbour if you don't look after him in time he'll do well enough in the world you will find answered the fisherman carelessly whenever he casts my nets they never come up empty 'it is better to be lucky than wise ' e meglio esser fortunato che savio this was a proverb which piedro had frequently heard from his father and to which he most willingly trusted because it gave him less trouble to fancy himself fortunate than to make himself wise come here child said his father to him when he returned home after the preceding conversation with the gardener how old are you my boy -- twelve years old is not it as old as francisco and older by six months said piedro and smarter and more knowing by six years said his father here take these fish to naples and let us see how you'll sell them for me venture a small fish as the proverb says to catch a great one i was too late with them at the market yesterday but nobody will know but what they are just fresh out of the water unless you go and tell them butta una sardella per pigliar un luccio not i trust me for that i'm not such a fool replied piedro laughing i leave that to francisco do you know i saw him the other day miss selling a melon for his father by turning the bruised side to the customer who was just laying down the money for it and who was a raw servant-boy moreover -- one who would never have guessed there were two sides to a melon if he had not as you say father been told of it off with you to market you are a droll chap said his father and will sell my fish cleverly i'll be bound as to the rest let every man take care of his own grapes you understand me piedro perfectly said the boy who perceived that his father was indifferent as to his honesty provided he sold fish at the highest price possible he proceeded to the market and he offered his fish with assiduity to every person whom he thought likely to buy it especially to those upon whom he thought he could impose he positively asserted to all who looked at his fish that they were just fresh out of the water good judges of men and fish knew that he said what was false and passed him by with neglect but it was at last what he called good luck to meet with the very same young raw servant-boy who would have bought the bruised melon from francisco he made up to him directly crying fish fine fresh fish fresh fish was it caught to-day said the boy yes this morning not an hour ago said piedro with the greatest effrontery the servant-boy was imposed upon and being a foreigner speaking the italian language but imperfectly and not being expert at reckoning the italian money he was no match for the cunning piedro who cheated him not only as to the freshness but as to the price of the commodity piedro received nearly half as much again for his fish as he ought to have done on his road homewards from naples to the little village of resina where his father lived he overtook francisco who was leading his father's ass the ass was laden with large panniers which were filled with the stalks and leaves of cauliflowers cabbages broccoli lettuces etc -- all the refuse of the neapolitan kitchens which are usually collected by the gardeners' boys and carried to the gardens round naples to be mixed with other manure well filled panniers truly said piedro as he overtook francisco and the ass the panniers were indeed not only filled to the top but piled up with much skill and care so that the load met over the animal's back it is not a very heavy load for the ass though it looks so large said francisco the poor fellow however shall have a little of this water added he leading the ass to a pool by the roadside i was not thinking of the ass boy i was not thinking of any ass but of you when i said 'well filled panniers truly ' this is your morning's work i presume and you'll make another journey to naples to- day on the same errand i warrant before your father thinks you have done enough not before my father thinks i have done enough but before i think so myself replied francisco i do enough to satisfy myself and my father too said piedro without slaving myself after your fashion look here producing the money he had received for the fish all this was had for asking it is no bad thing you'll allow to know how to ask for money properly i should be ashamed to beg or borrow either said francisco neither did i get what you see by begging or borrowing either said piedro but by using my wits not as you did yesterday when like a novice you showed the bruised side of your melon and so spoiled your market by your wisdom wisdom i think it still said francisco and your father asked piedro and my father said francisco mine is of a different way of thinking said piedro he always tells me that the buyer has need of a hundred eyes and if one can blind the whole hundred so much the better you must know i got off the fish to- day that my father could not sell yesterday in the market -- got it off for fresh just out of the river -- got twice as much as the market price for it and from whom think you why from the very booby that would have bought the bruised melon for a sound one if you would have let him you'll allow i'm no fool francisco and that i'm in a fair way to grow rich if i go on as i have begun stay said francisco you forgot that the booby you took in to-day will not be so easily taken in to-morrow he will buy no more fish from you because he will be afraid of your cheating him but he will be ready enough to buy fruit from me because he will know i shall not cheat him -- so you'll have lost a customer and i gained one with all my heart said piedro one customer does not make a market if he buys no more from me what care i there are people enough to buy fish in naples and do you mean to serve them all in the same manner asked francisco if they will be only so good as to give me leave said piedro laughing and repeating his father's proverb 'venture a small fish to catch a large one ' he had learned to think that to cheat in making bargains was witty and clever see anted and you have never considered then said francisco that all these people will one after another find you out in time ay in time but it will be some time first there are a great many of them enough to last me all the summer if i lose a customer a day said piedro and next summer observed francisco what will you do next summer is not come yet there is time enough to think what i shall do before next summer comes why now suppose the blockheads after they had been taken in and found it out all joined against me and would buy none of our fish -- what then are there no trades but that of a fisherman in naples are there not a hundred ways of making money for a smart lad like me as my father says what do you think of turning merchant and selling sugar-plums and cakes to the children in their market would they be hard to deal with think you i think not said francisco but i think the children would find out in time if they were cheated and would like it as little as the men i don't doubt them then in time i could you know change my trade -- sell chips and sticks in the wood-market -- hand about the lemonade to the fine folks or twenty other things there are trades enough boy yes for the honest dealer said francisco but for no other for in all of them you'll find as my father says that a good character is the best fortune to set up with change your trade ever so often you'll be found out for what you are at last and what am i pray said piedro angrily the whole truth of the matter is francisco that you envy my good luck and can't bear to hear this money jingle in my hand ay stroke the long ears of your ass and look as wise as you please it's better to be lucky than wise as my father says good morning to you when i am found out for what i am or when the worst comes to the worst i can drive a stupid ass with his panniers filled with rubbish as well as you do now honest francisco not quite so well unless you were honest francisco you would not fill his panniers quite so readily this was certain that francisco was so well known for his honesty amongst all the people at naples with whom his father was acquainted that everyone was glad to deal with him and as he never wronged anyone all were willing to serve him -- at least as much as they could without loss to themselves so that after the market was over his panniers were regularly filled by the gardeners and others with whatever he wanted his industry was constant his gains small but certain and he every day had more and more reason to trust to his father's maxim -- that honesty is the best policy the foreign servant lad to whom francisco had so honestly or as piedro said so sillily shown the bruised side of the melon was an englishman he left his native country of which he was extremely fond to attend upon his master to whom he was still more attached his master was in a declining state of health and this young lad waited on him a little more to his mind than his other servants we must in consideration of his zeal fidelity and inexperience pardon him for not being a good judge of fish though he had simplicity enough to be easily cheated once he had too much sense to be twice made a dupe the next time he met piedro in the market he happened to be in company with several english gentlemen's servants and he pointed piedro out to them all as an arrant knave they heard his cry of fresh fish fresh fish fine fresh fish with incredulous smiles and let him pass but not without some expressions of contempt though uttered in english he tolerably well understood for the tone of contempt is sufficiently expressive in all languages he lost more by not selling his fish to these people than he had gained the day before by cheating the english booby the market was well supplied and he could not get rid of his cargo is not this truly provoking said piedro as he passed by francisco who was selling fruit for his father look my basket is as heavy as when i left home and look at 'em yourself they really are fine fresh fish to-day and yet because that revengeful booby told how i took him in yesterday not one of yonder crowd would buy them and all the time they really are fresh to-day so they are said franscisco but you said so yesterday when they were not and he that was duped then is not ready to believe you to-day how does he know that you deserve it better he might have looked at the fish repeated piedro they are fresh to- day i am sure he need not have been afraid ay said francisco but as my father said to you once -- the scalded dog fears cold water il cane scottato dell' acqua calda ha paura poi della fredda here their conversation was interrupted by the same english lad who smiled as he came up to francisco and taking up a fine pine-apple he said in a mixture of bad italian and english -- i need not look at the other side of this you will tell me if it is not as good as it looks name your price i know you have but one and that an honest one and as to the rest i am able and willing to pay for what i buy that is to say my master is which comes to the same thing i wish your fruit could make him well and it would be worth its weight in gold to me at least we must have some of your grapes for him is he not well inquired francisco we must then pick out the best for him at the same time singling out a tempting bunch i hope he will like these but if you could some day come as far as resina it is a village but a few miles out of town where we have our vineyard you could there choose for yourself and pluck them fresh from the vines for your poor master bless you my good boy i should take you for an englishman by your way of dealing i'll come to your village only write me down the name for your italian names slip through my head i'll come to the vineyard if it was ten miles off and all the time we stay in naples may it not be so long as i fear it will with my master's leave which he never refuses me to anything that's proper i'll deal with you for all our fruit as sure as my name's arthur and with none else with my good will i wish all your countrymen would take after you in honesty indeed i do concluded the englishman looking full at piedro who took up his unsold basket of fish looking somewhat silly and gloomily walked off arthur the english servant was as good as his word he dealt constantly with francisco and proved an excellent customer buying from him during the whole season as much fruit as his master wanted his master who was an englishman of distinction was invited to take up his residence during his stay in italy at the count de f 's villa which was in the environs of naples -- an easy walk from resina francisco had the pleasure of seeing his father's vineyard often full of generous visitors and arthur who had circulated the anecdote of the bruised melon was he said proud to think that some of this was his doing and that an englishman never forgot a good turn be it from a countryman or foreigner my dear boy said francisco's father to him whilst arthur was in the vineyard helping to tend the vines i am to thank you and your honesty it seems for our having our hands so full of business this season it is fair you should have a share of our profits so i have father enough and enough when i see you and mother going on so well what can i want more oh my brave boy we know you are a grateful good son but i have been your age myself you have companions you have little expenses of your own here this vine this fig-tree and a melon a week next summer shall be yours with these make a fine figure amongst the little neapolitan merchants and all i wish is that you may prosper as well and by the same honest means in managing for yourself as you have done managing for me thank you father and if i prosper at all it shall be by those means and no other or i should not be worthy to be called your son piedro the cunning did not make quite so successful a summer's work as did francisco the honest no extraordinary events happened no singular instance of bad or good luck occurred but he felt as persons usually do the natural consequences of his own actions he pursued his scheme of imposing as far as he could upon every person he dealt with and the consequence was that at last nobody would deal with him it is easy to outwit one person but impossible to outwit all the world said a man who knew the world at least as well as either piedro or his father the duke de rochefoucault -- on peut etre puls fin qu'un autre mais pas plus fin que tous les autres piedro's father amongst others had reason to complain he saw his own customers fall off from him and was told whenever he went into the market that his son was such a cheat there was no dealing with him one day when he was returning from the market in a very bad humour in consequence of these reproaches and of his not having found customers for his goods he espied his smart son piedro at a little merchant's fruit-board devouring a fine gourd with prodigious greediness where glutton do you find money to pay for these dainties exclaimed his father coming close up to him with angry gestures piedro's mouth was much too full to make an immediate reply nor did his father wait for any but darting his hand into the youth's pocket pulled forth a handful of silver the money father said piedro that i got for the fish yesterday and that i meant to give you to-day before you went out then i'll make you remember it against another time sirrah said his father i'll teach you to fill your stomach with my money am i to lose my customers by your tricks and then find you here eating my all you are a rogue and everybody has found you out to be a rogue and the worst of rogues i find you who scruples not to cheat his own father saying these words with great vehemence he seized hold of piedro and in the very midst of the little fruit-market gave him a severe beating this beating did the boy no good it was vengeance not punishment piedro saw that his father was in a passion and knew that he was beaten because he was found out to be a rogue rather than for being one he recollected perfectly that his father once said to him let everyone take care of his own grapes indeed it was scarcely reasonable to expect that a boy who had been educated to think that he might cheat every customer he could in the way of trade should be afterwards scrupulously honest in his conduct towards the father whose proverbs encouraged his childhood in cunning piedro writhed with bodily pain as he left the market after his drubbing but his mind was not in the least amended on the contrary he was hardened to the sense of shame by the loss of reputation all the little merchants were spectators of this scene and heard his father's words you are a rogue and the worst of rogues who scruples not to cheat his own father these words were long remembered and long did piedro feel their effects he once flattered himself that when his trade of selling fish failed him he could readily engage in some other but he now found to his mortification that what francisco's father said proved true in all trades the best fortune to set up with is a good character not one of the little neapolitan merchants would either enter into partnership with him give him credit or even trade with him for ready money if you would cheat your own father to be sure you will cheat us was continually said to him by these prudent little people piedro was taunted and treated with contempt at home and abroad his father when he found that his son's smartness was no longer useful in making bargains shoved him out of his way whenever he met him all the food or clothes that he had at home seemed to be given to him grudgingly and with such expressions as these take that but it is too good for you you must eat this now instead of gourds and figs -- and be thankful you have even this piedro spent a whole winter very unhappily he expected that all his old tricks and especially what his father had said of him in the market- place would be soon forgotten but month passed after month and still these things were fresh in the memory of all who had known them it is not easy to get rid of a bad character a very great rogue was once heard to say that he would with all his heart give ten thousand pounds for a good character because he knew that he could make twenty thousand by it chartres something like this was the sentiment of our cunning hero when he experienced the evils of a bad reputation and when he saw the numerous advantages which francisco's good character procured such had been piedro's wretched education that even the hard lessons of experience could not alter its pernicious effects he was sorry his knavery had been detected but he still thought it clever to cheat and was secretly persuaded that if he had cheated successfully he should have been happy but i know i am not happy now said he to himself one morning as he sat alone disconsolate by the sea-shore dressed in tattered garments weak and hungry with an empty basket beside him his fishing- rod which he held between his knees bent over the dry sands instead of into the water for he was not thinking of what he was about his arms were folded his head hung down and his ragged hat was slouched over his face he was a melancholy spectacle francisco as he was coming from his father's vineyard with a large dish of purple and white grapes upon his head and a basket of melons and figs hanging upon his arm chanced to see piedro seated in this melancholy posture touched with compassion francisco approached him softly his footsteps were not heard upon the sands and piedro did not perceive that anyone was near him till he felt something cold touch his hand he then started and looking up saw a bunch of grapes which francisco was holding over his head eat them you'll find them very good i hope said francisco with a benevolent smile they are excellent -- most excellent and i am much obliged to you francisco said piedro i was very hungry and that's what i am now without anybody's caring anything about it i am not the favourite i was with my father but i know it is all my own fault well but cheer up said francisco my father always says 'one who knows he has been in fault and acknowledges it will scarcely be in fault again ' yes take as many figs as you will continued he and held his basket closer to piedro who as he saw cast a hungry eye upon one of the ripe figs but said piedro after he had taken several shall not i get you into a scrape by taking so many won't your father be apt to miss them do you think i would give them to you if they were not my own said francisco with a sudden glance of indignation well don't be angry that i asked the question it was only from fear of getting you into disgrace that i asked it it would not be easy for anybody to do that i hope said francisco rather proudly and to me less than anybody replied piedro in an insinuating tone i that am so much obliged to you a bunch of grapes and a few figs are no mighty obligation said francisco smiling i wish i could do more for you you seem indeed to have been very unhappy of late we never see you in the markets as we used to do no ever since my father beat me and called me rogue before all the children there i have never been able to show my face without being gibed at by one or t'other if you would but take me along with you amongst them and only just seem my friend for a day or two or so it would quite set me up again for they all like you i would rather be than seem your friend if i could said francisco ay to be sure that would be still better said piedro observing that francisco as he uttered his last sentence was separating the grapes and other fruits into two equal divisions to be sure i would rather you would be than seem a friend to me but i thought that was too much to ask at first though i have a notion notwithstanding i have been so unlucky lately -- i have a notion you would have no reason to repent of it you would find me no bad hand if you were to try and take me into partnership partnership interrupted francisco drawing back alarmed i had no thoughts of that but won't you can't you said piedro in a supplicating tone can't you have thoughts of it you'd find me a very active partner franscisco still drew back and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground he was embarrassed for he pitied piedro and he scarcely knew how to point out to him that something more is necessary in a partner in trade besides activity and that is honesty can't you repeated piedro thinking that he hesitated from merely mercenary motives you shall have what share of the profits you please i was not thinking of the profits said francisco but without meaning to be ill-natured to you piedro i must say that i cannot enter into any partnership with you at present but i will do what perhaps you will like as well said he taking half the fruit out of his basket you are heartily welcome to this try and sell it in the children's fruit market i'll go on before you and speak to those i am acquainted with and tell them you are going to set up a new character and that you hope to make it a good one hey shall i thank you for ever dear francisco cried piedro seizing his plentiful gift of fruit say what you please for me but don't make me say anything that is not true said francisco pausing no to be sure not said piedro i do mean to give no room for scandal if i could get them to trust me as they do you i should be happy indeed that is what you may do if you please said francisco adieu i wish you well with all my heart but i must leave you now or i shall be too late for the market chapter ii chi va piano va sano e anche lontano fair and softly goes far in a day piedro had now an opportunity of establishing a good character when he went into the market with his grapes and figs he found that he was not shunned or taunted as usual all seemed disposed to believe in his intended reformation and to give him a fair trial these favourable dispositions towards him were the consequence of francisco's benevolent representations he told them that he thought piedro had suffered enough to cure him of his tricks and that it would be cruelty in them because he might once have been in fault to banish him by their reproaches from amongst them and thus to prevent him from the means of gaining his livelihood honestly piedro made a good beginning and gave what several of the younger customers thought excellent bargains his grapes and figs were quickly sold and with the money that he got for them he the next day purchased from a fruit dealer a fresh supply and thus he went on for some time conducting himself with scrupulous honesty so that he acquired some credit among his companions they no longer watched him with suspicious eyes they trusted to his measures and weights and they counted less carefully the change which they received from him the satisfaction he felt from this alteration in their manners was at first delightful to piedro but in proportion to his credit his opportunities of defrauding increased and these became temptations which he had not the firmness to resist his old manner of thinking recurred i make but a few shillings a day and this is but slow work said he to himself what signifies my good character if i make so little by it light gains and frequent make a heavy purse was one of francisco's proverbs but piedro was in too great haste to get rich to take time into his account he set his invention to work and he did not want for ingenuity to devise means of cheating without running the risk of detection he observed that the younger part of the community were extremely fond of certain coloured sugar plums and of burnt almonds poco e spesso empie il l'orsetto with the money he had earned by two months' trading in fruit he laid in a large stock of what appeared to these little merchants a stock of almonds and sugar-plums and he painted in capital gold coloured letters upon his board sweetest largest most admirable sugar-plums of all colours ever sold in naples to be had here and in gratitude to his numerous customers piedro adds to these 'burnt almonds gratis ' this advertisement attracted the attention of all who could read and many who could not read heard it repeated with delight crowds of children surrounded piedro's board of promise and they all went away the first day amply satisfied each had a full measure of coloured sugar- plums at the usual price and along with these a burnt almond gratis the burnt almond had such an effect upon the public judgment that it was universally allowed that the sugar-plums were as the advertisement set forth the largest sweetest most admirable ever sold in naples though all the time they were in no respect better than any other sugar-plums it was generally reported that piedro gave full measure -- fuller than any other board in the city he measured the sugar-plums in a little cubical tin box and this it was affirmed he heaped up to the top and pressed down before he poured out the contents into the open hands of his approving customers this belief and piedro's popularity continued longer even than he had expected and as he thought his sugar-plums had secured their reputation with the generous public he gradually neglected to add burnt almonds gratis one day a boy of about ten years old passed carelessly by whistling as he went along and swinging a carpenter's rule in his hand ha what have we here cried he stopping to read what was written on piedro's board this promises rarely old as i am and tall of my age which makes the matter worse i am still as fond of sugar-plums as my little sister who is five years younger than i come signor fill me quick for i'm in haste to taste them two measures of the sweetest largest most admirable sugar-plums in naples -- one measure for myself and one for my little rosetta you'll pay for yourself and your sister then said piedro for no credit is given here no credit do i ask replied the lively boy when i told you i loved sugar-plums did i tell you i loved them or even my sister so well as to run in debt for them here's for myself and here's for my sister's share said he laying down his money and now for the burnt almonds gratis my good fellow they are all out i have been out of burnt almonds this great while said piedro then why are they in your advertisement here said carlo i have not had time to scratch them out of the board what not when you have by your own account been out of them a great while i did not know it required so much time to blot out a few words -- let us try and as he spoke carlo for that was the name of piedro's new customer pulled a bit of white chalk out of his pocket and drew a broad score across the line on the board which promised burnt almonds gratis you are most impatient said piedro i shall have a fresh stock of almonds to-morrow why must the board tell a lie to-day it would ruin me to alter it said piedro a lie may ruin you but i could scarcely think the truth could you have no right to meddle with me or my board said piedro put off his guard and out of his usual soft voice of civility by this last observation my character and that of my board are too firmly established now for any chance customer like you to injure i never dreamed of injuring you or anyone else said carlo -- i wish moreover you may not injure yourself do as you please with your board but give me my sugar-plums for i have some right to meddle with those having paid for them hold out your hand then no put them in here if you please put my sister's at least in here she likes to have them in this box i bought some for her in it yesterday and she'll think they'll taste the better out of the same box but how is this your measure does not fill my box nearly you give us very few sugar-plums for our money i give you full measure as i give to everybody the measure should be an inch cube i know said carlo that's what all the little merchants have agreed to you know true said piedro so it is and so it is i must allow said carlo measuring the outside of it with the carpenter's rule which he held in his hand an inch every way and yet by my eye -- and i have no bad one being used to measuring carpenter's work for my father -- by my eye i should think this would have held more sugar-plums the eye often deceives us said piedro there's nothing like measuring you find there's nothing like measuring i find indeed replied carlo as he looked closely at the end of his rule which since he spoke last he had put into the cube to take its depth in the inside this is not as deep by a quarter of an inch signor piedro measured within as it is measured without piedro changed colour terribly and seizing hold of the tin box endeavoured to wrest it from the youth who measured so accurately carlo held his prize fast and lifting it above his head he ran into the midst of the square where the little market was held exclaiming a discovery a discovery that concerns all who love sugar-plums a discovery a discovery that concerns all who have ever bought the sweetest and most admirable sugar-plums ever sold in naples the crowd gathered from all parts of the square as he spoke we have bought and we have bought of those sugar-plums cried several little voices at once if you mean piedro's the same continued carlo -- he who out of gratitude to his numerous customers gives or promises to give burnt almonds gratis excellent they were cried several voices we all know piedro well but what's your discovery my discovery is said carlo that you none of you know piedro look you here look at this box -- this is his measure it has a false bottom -- it holds only three-quarters as much as it ought to do and his numerous customers have all been cheated of one-quarter of every measure of the admirable sugar-plums they have bought from him 'think twice of a good bargain ' says the proverb so we have been finely duped indeed cried some of the bystanders looking at one another with a mortified air full of courtesy full of craft so this is the meaning of his burnt almonds gratis cried others all joined in an uproar of indignation except one who as he stood behind the rest expressed in his countenance silent surprise and sorrow chi et fa pi caress che non vole o ingannato t'ha o inganuar et vole is this piedro a relation of yours said carlo going up to this silent person i am sorry if he be that i have published his disgrace for i would not hurt you you don't sell sugar-plums as he does i'm sure for my little sister rosetta has often bought from you can this piedro be a friend of yours i wished to have been his friend but i see i can't said francisco he is a neighbour of ours and i pitied him but since he is at his old tricks again there's an end of the matter i have reason to be obliged to you for i was nearly taken in he has behaved so well for some time past that i intended this very evening to have gone to him and to have told him that i was willing to do for him what he has long begged of me to do -- to enter into partnership with him francisco francisco -- your measure lend us your measure exclaimed a number of little merchants crowding round him you have a measure for sugar-plums and we have all agreed to refer to that and to see how much we have been cheated before we go to break piedro's bench and declare him bankrupt -- the punishment for all knaves this word comes from two italian words bunco rotto -- broken bench bankers and merchants used formerly to count their money and write their bills of exchange upon benches in the streets and when a merchant or banker lost his credit and was unable to pay his debts his bench was broken they pressed on to francisco's board obtained his measure found that it held something more than a quarter above the quantity that could be contained in piedro's the cries of the enraged populace were now most clamorous they hung the just and the unjust measures upon high poles and forming themselves into a formidable phalanx they proceeded towards piedro's well known yellow lettered board exclaiming as they went along common cause common cause the little neapolitan merchants will have no knaves amongst them break his bench break his bench he is a bankrupt in honesty piedro saw the mob heard the indignant clamour and terrified at the approach of numbers he fled with the utmost precipitation having scarcely time to pack up half his sugar-plums there was a prodigious number more than would have filled many honest measures scattered upon the ground and trampled under foot by the crowd piedro's bench was broken and the public vengeance wreaked itself also upon his treacherous painted board it was after being much disfigured by various inscriptions expressive of the universal contempt for piedro hung up in a conspicuous part of the market-place and the false measure was fastened like a cap upon one of its corners piedro could never more show his face in this market and all hopes of friendship -- all hopes of partnership with francisco -- were for ever at an end if rogues would calculate they would cease to be rogues for they would certainly discover that it is most for their interest to be honest -- setting aside the pleasure of being esteemed and beloved of having a safe conscience with perfect freedom from all the various embarrassments and terror to which knaves are subject is it not clear that our crafty hero would have gained rather more by a partnership with francisco and by a fair character than he could possibly obtain by fraudulent dealing in comfits when the mob had dispersed after satisfying themselves with executing summary justice upon piedro's bench and board francisco found a carpenter's rule lying upon the ground near piedro's broken bench which he recollected to have seen in the hands of carlo he examined it carefully and he found carlo's name written upon it and the name of the street where he lived and though it was considerably out of his way he set out immediately to restore the rule which was a very handsome one to its rightful owner after a hot walk through several streets he overtook carlo who had just reached the door of his own house carlo was particularly obliged to him he said for restoring this rule to him as it was a present from the master of a vessel who employed his father to do carpenter's work for him one should not praise one's self they say continued carlo but i long so much to gain your good opinion that i must tell you the whole history of the rule you have restored it was given to me for having measured the work and made up the bill of a whole pleasure-boat myself you may guess i should have been sorry enough to have lost it thank you for its being once more in my careless hands and tell me i beg whenever i can do you any service by-the-by i can make up for you a fruit stall i'll do it to-morrow and it shall be the admiration of the market is there anything else you could think of for me why yes said francisco since you are so good-natured perhaps you'd be kind enough to tell me the meaning of some of those lines and figures that i see upon your rule i have a great curiosity to know their use that i'll explain to you with pleasure as far as i know them myself but when i'm at fault my father who is cleverer than i am and understands trigonometry can help us out trigonometry repeated francisco not a little alarmed at the high sounding word that's what i certainly shall never understand oh never fear replied carlo laughing i looked just as you do now- -i felt just as you do now -- all in a fright and a puzzle when i first heard of angles and sines and cosines and arcs and centres and complements and tangents oh mercy mercy interrupted francisco whilst carlo laughed with a benevolent sense of superiority why said carlo you'll find all these things are nothing when you are used to them but i cannot explain my rule to you here broiling in the sun besides it will not be the work of a day i promise you but come and see us at your leisure hours and we'll study it together i have a great notion we shall become friends and to begin step in with me now said carlo and eat a little macaroni with us i know it is ready by this time besides you'll see my father and he'll show you plenty of rules and compasses as you like such things and then i'll go home with you in the cool of the evening and you shall show me your melons and vines and teach me in time something of gardening oh i see we must be good friends just made for each other so come in -- no ceremony carlo was not mistaken in his predictions he and francisco became very good friends spent all their leisure hours together either in carlo's workshop or in francisco's vineyard and they mutually improved each other francisco before he saw his friend's rule knew but just enough of arithmetic to calculate in his head the price of the fruit which he sold in the market but with carlo's assistance and the ambition to understand the tables and figures upon the wonderful rule he set to work in earnest and in due time satisfied both himself and his master who knows but these things that i am learning now may be of some use to me before i die said francisco as he was sitting one morning with his tutor the carpenter to be sure it will said the carpenter putting down his compasses with which he was drawing a circle -- arithmetic is a most useful and i was going to say necessary thing to be known by men in all stations and a little trigonometry does no harm in short my maxim is that no knowledge comes amiss for a man's head is of as much use to him as his hands and even more so a word to the wise will always suffice besides to say nothing of making a fortune is not there a great pleasure in being something of a scholar and being able to pass one's time with one's book and one's compasses and pencil safe companions these for young and old no one gets into mischief that has pleasant things to think of and to do when alone and i know for my part that trigonometry is -- here the carpenter just as he was going to pronounce a fresh panegyric upon his favourite trigonometry was interrupted by the sudden entrance of his little daughter rosetta all in tears a very unusual spectacle for taking the year round she shed fewer tears than any child of her age in naples why my dear good humoured little rosetta what has happened why these large tears said her brother carlo and he went up to her and wiped them from her cheeks and these that are going over the bridge of the nose so fast i must stop these tears too said carlo rosetta at this speech burst out laughing and said that she did not know till then that she had any bridge on her nose and were these shells the cause of the tears said her brother looking at a heap of shells which she held before her in her frock yes partly said rosetta it was partly my own fault but not all you know i went out to the carpenter's yard near the arsenal where all the children are picking up chips and sticks so busily and i was as busy as any of them because i wanted to fill my basket soon and then i thought i should sell my basketful directly in the little wood-market as soon as i had filled my basket and made up my faggot which was not done brother till i was almost baked by the sun for i was forced to wait by the carpenters for the bits of wood to make up my faggot -- i say when it was all ready and my basket full i left it altogether in the yard that was not wise to leave it said carlo but i only left it for a few minutes brother and i could not think anybody would be so dishonest as to take it whilst i was away i only just ran to tell a boy who had picked up all these beautiful shells upon the sea-shore and who wanted to sell them that i should be glad to buy them from him if he would only be so good as to keep them for me for an hour or so till i had carried my wood to market and till i had sold it and so had money to pay him for the shells your heart was set mightily on these shells rosetta yes for i thought you and francisco brother would like to have them for your nice grotto that you are making at resina that was the reason i was in such a hurry to get them the boy who had them to sell was very good-natured he poured them into my lap and said i had such an honest face he would trust me and that as he was in a great hurry he could not wait an hour whilst i sold my wood but that he was sure i would pay him in the evening and he told me that he would call here this evening for the money but now what shall i do carlo i shall have no money to give him i must give back his shells and that's a great pity but how happened it that you did not sell your wood oh i forgot did not i tell you that when i went for my basket do you know it was empty quite empty not a chip left some dishonest person had carried it all off had not i reason to cry now carlo ' i'll go this minute into the wood-market and see if i can find your faggot won't that be better than crying said her brother should you know any one of your pieces of wood again if you were to see them yes one of them i am sure i should know again said rosetta it had a notch at one end of it where one of the carpenters cut it off from another piece of wood for me and is this piece of wood from which the carpenter cut it still to be seen said francisco yes it is in the yard but i cannot bring it to you for it is very heavy we can go to it said francisco and i hope we shall recover your basketful carlo and his friend went with rosetta immediately to the yard near the arsenal saw the notched piece of wood and then proceeded to the little wood-market and searched every heap that lay before the little factors but no notched bit was to be found and rosetta declared that she did not see one stick that looked at all like any of hers on their part her companions eagerly untied their faggots to show them to her and exclaimed that they were incapable of taking what did not belong to them that of all persons they should never have thought of taking anything from the good natured little rosetta who was always ready to give to others and to help them in making up their loads despairing of discovering the thief francisco and carlo left the market as they were returning home they were met by the english servant arthur who asked francisco where he had been and where he was going as soon as he heard of rosetta's lost faggot and of the bit of wood notched at one end of which rosetta drew the shape with a piece of chalk which her brother had lent her arthur exclaimed i have seen such a bit of wood as this within this quarter of an hour but i cannot recollect where stay this was at the baker's i think where i went for some rolls for my master it was lying beside his oven to the baker's they all went as fast as possible and they got there but just in time the baker had in his hand the bit of wood with which he was that instant going to feed his oven stop good mr baker cried rosetta who ran into the baker's shop first and as he heard stop stop re-echoed by many voices the baker stopped and turning to francisco carlo and arthur begged with a countenance of some surprise to know why they had desired him to stop the case was easily explained and the baker told them that he did not buy any wood in the little market that morning that this faggot he had purchased between the hours of twelve and one from a lad about francisco's height whom he met near the yard of the arsenal this is my bit of wood i am sure i know it by this notch said rosetta well said the baker if you will stay here a few minutes you will probably see the lad who sold it to me he desired to be paid in bread and my bread was not quite baked when he was here i bid him call again in an hour and i fancy he will be pretty punctual for he looked desperately hungry the baker had scarcely finished speaking when francisco who was standing watching at the door exclaimed here comes piedro i hope he is not the boy who sold you the wood mr baker he is the boy though replied the baker and piedro who now entered the shop started at the sight of carlo and francisco whom he had never seen since the day of disgrace in the fruit-market your servant signor piedro said carlo i have the honour to tell you that this piece of wood and all that you took out of the basket which you found in the yard of the arsenal belongs to my sister yes indeed cried rosetta piedro being very certain that nobody saw him when he emptied rosetta's basket and imagining that he was suspected only upon the bare assertion of a child like rosetta who might be baffled and frightened out of her story boldly denied the charge and defied any one to prove him guilty he has a right to be heard in his own defence said arthur with the cool justice of an englishman and he stopped the angry carlo's arm who was going up to the culprit with all the italian vehemence of oratory and gesture arthur went on to say something in bad italian about the excellence of an english trial by jury which carlo was too much enraged to hear but to which francisco paid attention and turning to piedro he asked him if he was willing to be judged by twelve of his equals with all my heart said piedro still maintaining an unmoved countenance and they returned immediately to the little wood-market on their way they had passed through the fruit-market and crowds of those who were well acquainted with piedro's former transactions followed to hear the event of the present trial arthur could not especially as he spoke wretched italian make the eager little merchants understand the nature and advantages of an english trial by jury they preferred their own summary mode of proceeding francisco in whose integrity they all had perfect confidence was chosen with unanimous shouts for the judge but he declined the office and another was appointed he was raised upon a bench and the guilty but insolent looking piedro and the ingenuous modest rosetta stood before him she made her complaint in a very artless manner and piedro with ingenuity which in a better cause would have deserved admiration spoke volubly and craftily in his own defence but all that he could say could not alter facts the judge compared the notched bit of wood found at the baker's with a piece from which it was cut which he went to see in the yard of the arsenal it was found to fit exactly the judge then found it impossible to restrain the loud indignation of all the spectators the prisoner was sentenced never more to sell wood in the market and the moment sentence was pronounced piedro was hissed and hooted out of the market-place thus a third time he deprived himself of the means of earning his bread we shall not dwell upon all his petty methods of cheating in the trades he next attempted he handed lemonade about in a part of naples where he was not known but he lost his customers by putting too much water and too little lemon into this beverage he then took to the waters from the sulphurous springs and served them about to foreigners but one day as he was trying to jostle a competitor from the coach door he slipped his foot and broke his glasses they had been borrowed from an old woman who hired out glasses to the boys who sold lemonade piedro knew that it was the custom to pay of course for all that was broken but this he was not inclined to do he had a few shillings in his pocket and thought that it would be very clever to defraud this poor woman of her right and to spend his shillings upon what he valued much more than he did his good name -- macaroni the shillings were soon gone we shall now for the present leave piedro to his follies and his fate or to speak more properly to his follies and their inevitable consequences francisco was all this time acquiring knowledge from his new friends without neglecting his own or his father's business he contrived during the course of autumn and winter to make himself a tolerable arithmetician carlo's father could draw plans in architecture neatly and pleased with the eagerness francisco showed to receive instruction he willingly put a pencil and compasses into his hand and taught him all he knew himself francisco had great perseverance and by repeated trials he at length succeeded in copying exactly all the plans which his master lent him his copies in time surpassed the originals and carlo exclaimed with astonishment why francisco what an astonishing genius you have for drawing -- absolutely you draw plans better than my father as to genius said francisco honestly i have none all that i have done has been done by hard labour i don't know how other people do things but i am sure that i never have been able to get anything done well but by patience don't you remember carlo how you and even rosetta laughed at me the first time your father put a pencil into my awkward clumsy hands because said carlo laughing again at the recollection you held your pencil so drolly and when you were to cut it you cut it just as if you were using a pruning-knife to your vines but now it is your turn to laugh for you surpass us all and the times are changed since i set about to explain this rule of mine to you ay that rule said francisco -- how much i owe to it some great people when they lose any of their fine things cause the crier to promise a reward of so much money to anyone who shall find and restore their trinket how richly have you and your father rewarded me for returning this rule francisco's modesty and gratitude as they were perfectly sincere attached his friends to him most powerfully but there was one person who regretted our hero's frequent absences from his vineyard at resina not francisco's father for he was well satisfied his son never neglected his business and as to the hours spent in naples he had so much confidence in francisco that he felt no apprehensions of his getting into bad company when his son had once said to him i spend my time at such a place and in such and such a manner he was as well convinced of its being so as if he had watched and seen him every moment of the day but it was arthur who complained of francisco's absence i see because i am an englishman said he you don't value my friendship and yet that is the very reason you ought to value it no friends so good as the english be it spoken without offence to your italian friend for whom you now continually leave me to dodge up and down here in resina without a soul that i like to speak to for you are the only italian i ever liked you shall like another i promise you said francisco you must come with me to carlo's and see how i spend my evenings then complain of me if you can it was the utmost stretch of arthur's complaisance to pay this visit but in spite of his national prejudices and habitual reserve of temper he was pleased with the reception he met with from the generous carlo and the playful rosetta they showed him francisco's drawings with enthusiastic eagerness and arthur though no great judge of drawing was in astonishment and frequently repeated i know a gentleman who visits my master who would like these things i wish i might have them to show him take them then said carlo i wish all naples could see them provided they might be liked half as well as i like them arthur carried off the drawings and one day when his master was better than usual and when he was at leisure eating a dessert of francisco's grapes he entered respectfully with his little portfolio under his arm and begged permission to show his master a few drawings done by the gardener's son whose grapes he was eating though not quite so partial a judge as the enthusiastic carlo this gentleman was both pleased and surprised at the sight of these drawings considering how short a time francisco had applied himself to this art and what slight instructions he had received arthur was desired to summon the young artist francisco's honest open manner joined to the proofs he had given of his abilities and the character arthur gave him for strict honesty and constant kindness to his parents interested mr lee the name of this english gentleman much in his favour mr lee was at this time in treaty with an italian painter whom he wished to engage to copy for him exactly some of the cornices mouldings tablets and antique ornaments which are to be seen amongst the ruins of the ancient city of herculaneum we must give those of our young english readers who may not be acquainted with the ancient city of herculaneum some idea of it none can be ignorant that near naples is the celebrated volcanic mountain of vesuvius -- that from time to time there happen violent eruptions from this mountain that is to say flames and immense clouds of smoke issue from different openings mouths or craters as they are called but more especially from the summit of the mountain which is distinguished by the name of the crater a rumbling and afterwards a roaring noise is heard within and prodigious quantities of stones and minerals burnt into masses scoriae are thrown out of the crater sometimes to a great distance the hot ashes from mount vesuvius have often been seen upon the roofs of the houses of naples from which it is six miles distant streams of lava run down the sides of the mountains during the time of an eruption destroying everything in their way and overwhelm the houses and vineyards which are in the neighbourhood about 17oo years ago during the reign of the roman emperor titus there happened a terrible eruption of mount vesuvius and a large city called herculaneum which was situated at about four miles' distance from the volcano was overwhelmed by the streams of lava which poured into it filled up the streets and quickly covered over the tops of the houses so that the whole was no more visible it remained for many years buried the lava which covered it became in time fit for vegetation plants grew there a new soil was formed and a new town called portici was built over this place where herculaneum formerly stood the little village of resina is also situated near the spot about fifty years ago in a poor man's garden at resina a hole in a well about thirty feet below the surface of the earth was observed some persons had the curiosity to enter into this hole and after creeping underground for some time they came to the foundations of houses the peasants inhabitants of the village who had probably never heard of herculaneum were somewhat surprised at their discovery about the same time in a pit in the town of portici a similar passage underground was discovered and by orders of the king of naples workmen were employed to dig away the earth and clear the passage they found at length the entrance into the town which during the reign of titus was buried under lava it was about eighty-eight neapolitan palms a palm contains near nine inches below the top of the pit the workmen as they cleared the passages marked their way with chalk when they came to any turning lest they should lose themselves the streets branched out in many directions and lying across them the workmen often found large pieces of timber beams and rafters some broken in the fall others entire these beams and rafters are burned quite black like charcoal except those that were found in moist places which have more the colour of rotten wood and which are like a soft paste into which you might run your hand the walls of the houses slant some one way some another and some are upright several magnificent buildings of brick faced with marble of different colours are partly seen where the workmen have cleared away the earth and lava with which they were encrusted columns of red and white marble and flights of steps are seen in different places and out of the ruins of the palaces some very fine statues and pictures have been dug foreigners who visit naples are very curious to see this subterraneous city and are desirous to carry with them into their own country some proofs of their having examined this wonderful place philosophical transactions vol ix p 440 chapter iii tutte le gran faciende si fanno di poca cosa what great events from trivial causes spring signor camillo the artist employed by mr lee to copy some of the antique ornaments in herculaneum was a liberal minded man perfectly free from that mean jealousy which would repress the efforts of rising genius here is a lad scarcely fifteen a poor gardener's son who with merely the instructions he could obtain from a common carpenter has learned to draw these plans and elevations which you see are tolerably neat what an advantage your instruction would be to him said mr lee as he introduced francisco to signor camillo i am interested in this lad from what i have learned of his good conduct i hear he is strictly honest and one of the best of sons let us do something for him if you will give him some knowledge of your art i will as far as money can recompense you for your loss of time pay whatever you may think reasonable for his instruction signor camillo made no difficulties he was pleased with his pupil's appearance and every day he liked him better and better in the room where they worked together there were some large books of drawings and plates which francisco saw now and then opened by his master and which he had a great desire to look over but when he was left in the room by himself he never touched them because he had not permission signor camillo the first day he came into this room with his pupil said to him here are many valuable books and drawings young man i trust from the character i have heard of you that they will be perfectly safe here some weeks after francisco had been with the painter they had occasion to look for the front of a temple in one of these large books what don't you know in which book to look for it francisco cried his master with some impatience is it possible that you have been here so long with these books and that you cannot find the print i mean had you half the taste i gave you credit for you would have singled it out from all the rest and have it fixed in your memory but signor i never saw it said francisco respectfully or perhaps i should have preferred it that you never saw it young man is the very thing of which i complain is a taste for the arts to be learned think you by looking at the cover of a book like this is it possible that you never thought of opening it often and often cried francisco have i longed to open it but i thought it was forbidden me and however great my curiosity in your absence i have never touched them i hoped indeed that the time would come when you would have the goodness to show them to me and so the time is come excellent young man cried camillo much as i love taste i love integrity more i am now sure of your having the one and let me see whether you have as i believe you have the other sit you down here beside me and we will look over these books together the attention with which his young pupil examined everything and the pleasure he unaffectedly expressed in seeing these excellent prints sufficiently convinced his judicious master that it was not from the want of curiosity or taste that he had never opened these tempting volumes his confidence in francisco was much increased by this circumstance slight as it may appear one day signor camillo came behind francisco as he was drawing with much intentness and tapping him upon the shoulder he said to him put up your pencils and follow me i can depend upon your integrity i have pledged myself for it bring your note-book with you and follow me i will this day show you something that will entertain you at least as much as my large book of prints follow me francisco followed till they came to the pit near the entrance of herculaneum i have obtained leave for you to accompany me said his master and you know i suppose that this is not a permission granted to everyone paintings of great value besides ornaments of gold and silver antique bracelets rings etc are from time to time found amongst these ruins and therefore it is necessary that no person should be admitted whose honesty cannot be depended upon thus even francisco's talents could not have advanced him in the world unless they had been united to integrity he was much delighted and astonished by the new scene that was now opened to his view and as day after day he accompanied his master to this subterraneous city he had leisure for observation he was employed as soon as he had gratified his curiosity in drawing there are niches in the walls in several places from which pictures have been dug and these niches are often adorned with elegant masques figures and animals which have been left by the ignorant or careless workmen and which are going fast to destruction signor camillo who was copying these for his english employer had a mind to try his pupil's skill and pointing to a niche bordered with grotesque figures he desired him to try if he could make any hand of it francisco made several trials and at last finished such an excellent copy that his enthusiastic and generous master with warm encomiums carried it immediately to his patron and he had the pleasure to receive from mr lee a purse containing five guineas as a reward and encouragement for his pupil francisco had no sooner received this money than he hurried to his father and mother's cottage his mother some months before this time had taken a small dairy farm and her son had once heard her express a wish that she was but rich enough to purchase a remarkably fine brindled cow which belonged to a farmer in the neighbourhood here my dear mother cried francisco pouring the guineas into her lap and here continued he emptying a bag which contained about as much more in small italian coins the profits of trade-money he had fairly earned during the two years he sold fruit amongst the little neapolitan merchants this is all yours dearest mother and i hope it will be enough to pay for the brindled cow nay you must not refuse me- -i have set my heart upon the cow being milked by you this very evening and i'll produce my best bunches of grapes and my father perhaps will give us a melon for i've had no time for melons this season and i'll step to naples and invite -- may i mother -- my good friends dear carlo and your favourite little rosetta and my old drawing master and my friend arthur and we'll sup with you at your dairy the happy mother thanked her son and the father assured him that neither melon nor pine-apple should be spared to make a supper worthy of his friends the brindled cow was bought and arthur and carlo and rosetta most joyfully accepted their invitation the carpenter had unluckily appointed to settle a long account that day with one of his employers and he could not accompany his children it was a delicious evening they left naples just as the sea-breeze after the heats of the day was most refreshingly felt the walk to resina the vineyard the dairy and most of all the brindled cow were praised by carlo and rosetta with all the italian superlatives which signify most beautiful most delightful most charming whilst the english arthur with as warm a heart was more temperate in his praise declaring that this was the most like an english summer's evening of any he had ever felt since he came to italy and that moreover the cream was almost as good as what he had been used to drink in cheshire the company who were all pleased with each other and with the gardener's good fruit which he produced in great abundance did not think of separating till late it was a bright moonlight night and carlo asked his friend if he would walk with them part of the way to naples yes all the way most willingly cried francisco that i may have the pleasure of giving to your father with my own hands this fine bunch of grapes that i have reserved for him out of my own share add this fine pine-apple for my share then said his father and a pleasant walk to you my young friends they proceeded gaily along and when they reached naples as they passed through the square where the little merchants held their market francisco pointed to the spot where he found carlo's rule he never missed an opportunity of showing his friends that he did not forget their former kindness to him that rule said he has been the cause of all my present happiness and i thank you for -- oh never mind thanking him now interrupted rosetta but look yonder and tell me what all those people are about she pointed to a group of men women and children who were assembled under a piazza listening in various attitudes of attention to a man who was standing upon a flight of steps speaking in a loud voice and with much action to the people who surrounded him francisco carlo and rosetta joined his audience the moon shone full upon his countenance which was very expressive and which varied frequently according to the characters of the persons whose history he was telling according to all the changes of their fortune this man was one of those who are called improvisatori -- persons who in italian towns go about reciting verses or telling stories which they are supposed to invent as they go on speaking some of these people speak with great fluency and collect crowds round them in the public streets when an improvisatore sees the attention of his audience fixed and when he comes to some very interesting part of his narrative he dexterously drops his hat upon the ground and pauses till his auditors have paid tribute to his eloquence when he thinks the hat sufficiently full he takes it up again and proceeds with his story the hat was dropped just as francisco and his two friends came under the piazza the orator had finished one story and was going to commence another he fixed his eyes upon francisco then glanced at carlo and rosetta and after a moment's consideration he began a story which bore some resemblance to one that our young english readers may perhaps know by the name of cornaro or the grateful turk francisco was deeply interested in this narrative and when the hat was dropped he eagerly threw in his contribution at the end of the story when the speaker's voice stopped there was a momentary silence which was broken by the orator himself who exclaimed as he took up the hat which lay at his feet my friends here is some mistake this is not my hat it has been changed whilst i was taken up with my story pray gentlemen find my hat amongst you it was a remarkably good one a present from a nobleman for an epigram i made i would not lose my hat for twice its value it has my name written withinside of it dominicho improvisatore pray gentlemen examine your hats everybody present examined their hats and showed them to dominicho but his was not amongst them no one had left the company the piazza was cleared and searched in vain the hat has vanished by magic said dominicho yes and by the same magic a statue moves cried carlo pointing to a figure standing in a niche which had hitherto escaped observation the face was so much in the shade that carlo did not at first perceive that the statue was piedro piedro when he saw himself discovered burst into a loud laugh and throwing down dominicho's hat which he held in his hand behind him cried a pretty set of novices most excellent players at hide-and-seek you would make whether piedro really meant to have carried off the poor man's hat or whether he was as he said merely in jest we leave it to those who know his general character to decide carlo shook his head still at your old tricks piedro said he remember the old proverb no fox so cunning but he comes to the furrier's at last tutte le volpi si trovano in pellicera i defy the furrier and you too replied piedro taking up his own ragged hat i have no need to steal hats i can afford to buy better than you'll have upon your head francisco a word with you if you have done crying at the pitiful story you have been listening to so attentively and what would you say to me said francisco following him a few steps do not detain me long because my friends will wait for me if they are friends they can wait said piedro you need not be ashamed of being seen in my company now i can tell you for i am as i always told you i should be the richest man of the two rich you rich cried francisco well then it was impossible you could mean to trick that poor man out of his good hat impossible said piedro francisco did not consider that those who have habits of pilfering continue to practise them often when the poverty which first tempted them to dishonesty ceases impossible you stare when i tell you i am rich but the thing is so moreover i am well with my father at home i have friends in naples and i call myself piedro the lucky look you here said he producing an old gold coin this does not smell of fish does it my father is no longer a fisherman nor i either neither do i sell sugar-plums to children nor do i slave myself in a vineyard like some folks but fortune when i least expected it has stood my friend i have many pieces of gold like this digging in my father's garden it was my luck to come to an old roman vessel full of gold i have this day agreed for a house in naples for my father we shall live whilst we can afford it like great folks you will see and i shall enjoy the envy that will be felt by some of my old friends the little neapolitan merchants who will change their note when they see my change of fortune what say you to all this francisco the honest that i wish you joy of your prosperity and hope you may enjoy it long and well well no doubt of that everyone who has it enjoys it well he always dances well to whom fortune pipes assai ben balla a chi fortuna suona yes no longer pipe no longer dance replied francisco and here they parted for piedro walked away abruptly much mortified to perceive that his prosperity did not excite much envy or command any additional respect from francisco i would rather said francisco when he returned to carlo and rosetta who waited for him under the portico where he left them -- i would rather have such good friends as you carlo and arthur and some more i could name and besides that have a clear conscience and work honestly for my bread than be as lucky as piedro do you know he has found a treasure he says in his father's garden -- a vase full of gold he showed me one of the gold pieces much good may they do him i hope he came honestly by them said carlo but ever since the affair of the double measure i suspect double-dealing always from him it is not our affair however let him make himself happy his way and we ours he that would live in peace and rest must hear and see and say the best odi vedi taci se vuoi viver in pace all piedro's neighbours did not follow this peaceable maxim for when he and his father began to circulate the story of the treasure found in the garden the village of resina did not give them implicit faith people nodded and whispered and shrugged their shoulders then crossed themselves and declared that they would not for all the riches of naples change places with either piedro or his father regardless or pretending to be regardless of these suspicions piedro and his father persisted in their assertions the fishing-nets were sold and everything in their cottage was disposed of they left resina went to live at naples and after a few weeks the matter began to be almost forgotten in the village the old gardener francisco's father was one of those who endeavoured to think the best and all that he said upon the subject was that he would not exchange francisco the honest for piedro the lucky that one can't judge of the day till one sees the evening as well as the morning la vita il fine -- e di loda la sera compute the morn and evening of their day -- pope not to leave our readers longer in suspense we must inform them that the peasants of resina were right in their suspicions piedro had never found any treasure in his father's garden but he came by his gold in the following manner -- after he was banished from the little wood-market for stealing rosetta's basketful of wood after he had cheated the poor woman who let glasses out to hire out of the value of the glasses which he broke and in short after he had entirely lost his credit with all who knew him he roamed about the streets of naples reckless of what became of him he found the truth of the proverb that credit lost is like a venice glass broken -- it can't be mended again the few shillings which he had in his pocket supplied him with food for a few days at last he was glad to be employed by one of the peasants who came to naples to load their asses with manure out of the streets they often follow very early in the morning or during the night-time the trace of carriages that are gone or that are returning from the opera and piedro was one night at this work when the horses of a nobleman's carriage took fright at the sudden blaze of some fireworks the carriage was overturned near him a lady was taken out of it and was hurried by her attendants into a shop where she stayed till her carriage was set to rights she was too much alarmed for the first ten minutes after her accident to think of anything but after some time she perceived that she had lost a valuable diamond cross which she had worn that night at the opera she was uncertain where she had dropped it the shop the carriage the street were searched for it in vain piedro saw it fall as the lady was lifted out of the carriage seized upon it and carried it off ignorant as he was of the full value of what he had stolen he knew not how to satisfy himself as to this point without trusting someone with the secret after some hesitation he determined to apply to a jew who as it was whispered was ready to buy everything that was offered to him for sale without making any troublesome inquiries it was late he waited till the streets were cleared and then knocked softly at the back door of the jew's house the person who opened the door for piedro was his own father piedro started back but his father had fast hold of him what brings you here said the father in a low voice a voice which expressed fear and rage mixed only to ask my way -- my shortest way stammered piedro no equivocations tell me what brings you here at this time of the night i will know piedro who felt himself in his father's grasp and who knew that his father would certainly search him to find out what he had brought to sell thought it most prudent to produce the diamond cross his father could but just see its lustre by the light of a dim lamp which hung over their heads in the gloomy passage in which they stood you would have been duped if you had gone to sell this to the jew it is well it has fallen into my hands how came you by it piedro answered that he had found it in the street go your ways home then said his father it is safe with me concern yourself no more about it piedro was not inclined thus to relinquish his booty and he now thought proper to vary in his account of the manner in which he found the cross he now confessed that it had dropped from the dress of a lady whose carriage was overturned as she was coming home from the opera and he concluded by saying that if his father took his prize from him without giving him his share of the profits he would go directly to the shop where the lady stopped whilst her servants were raising the carriage and that he would give notice of his having found the cross piedro's father saw that his smart son though scarcely sixteen years of age was a match for him in villainy he promised him that he should have half of whatever the jew would give for the diamonds and piedro insisted upon being present at the transaction we do not wish to lay open to our young readers scenes of iniquity it is sufficient to say that the jew who was a man old in all the arts of villainy contrived to cheat both his associates and obtained the diamond cross for less than half its value the matter was managed so that the transaction remained undiscovered the lady who lost the cross after making fruitless inquiries gave up the search and piedro and his father rejoiced in the success of their manoeuvres it is said that ill gotten wealth is quickly spent and so it proved in this instance both father and son lived a riotous life as long as their money lasted and it did not last many months what his bad education began bad company finished and piedro's mind was completely ruined by the associates with whom he became connected during what he called his prosperity when his money was at an end these unprincipled friends began to look cold upon him and at last plainly told him -- if you mean to live with us you must live as we do they lived by robbery vien presto consumato l'ingiustamente acquistato piedro though familiarized to the idea of fraud was shocked at the thought of becoming a robber by profession how difficult it is to stop in the career of vice whether piedro had power to stop or whether he was hurried on by his associates we shall for the present leave in doubt chapter iv we turn with pleasure from piedro the cunning to francisco the honest francisco continued the happy and useful course of his life by his unremitting perseverance he improved himself rapidly under the instructions of his master and friend signor camillo his friend we say for the fair and open character of francisco won or rather earned the friendship of this benevolent artist the english gentleman seemed to take a pride in our hero's success and good conduct he was not one of those patrons who think that they have done enough when they have given five guineas his servant arthur always considered every generous action of his master's as his own and was particularly pleased whenever this generosity was directed towards francisco as for carlo and the little rosetta they were the companions of all the pleasant walks which francisco used to take in the cool of the evening after he had been shut up all day at his work and the old carpenter delighted with the gratitude of his pupil frequently repeated -- that he was proud to have given the first instructions to such a genius and that he had always prophesied francisco would be a great man and a good man papa said rosetta for though he has grown so great and though he goes into palaces now to say nothing of that place underground where he has leave to go yet notwithstanding all this he never forgets my brother carlo and you that's the way to have good friends said the carpenter and i like his way he does more than he says facts are masculine and words are feminine i fatti sono maschii le parole femmine these goods friends seemed to make francisco happier than piedro could be made by his stolen diamonds one morning francisco was sent to finish a sketch of the front of an ancient temple amongst the ruins of herculaneum he had just reached the pit and the men were about to let him down with cords in the usual manner when his attention was caught by the shrill sound of a scolding woman's voice he looked and saw at some paces distant this female fury who stood guarding the windlass of a well to which with threatening gestures and most voluble menaces she forbade all access the peasants -- men women and children who had come with their pitchers to draw water at this well -- were held at bay by the enraged female not one dared to be the first to advance whilst she grasped with one hand the handle of the windlass and with the other tanned muscular arm extended governed the populace bidding them remember that she was padrona or mistress of the well they retired in hopes of finding a more gentle padrona at some other well in the neighbourhood and the fury when they were out of sight divided the long black hair which hung over her face and turning to one of the spectators appealed to them in a sober voice and asked if she was not right in what she had done i that am padrona of the well said she addressing herself to francisco who with great attention was contemplating her with the eye of a painter -- i that am padrona of the well must in times of scarcity do strict justice and preserve for ourselves alone the water of our well there is scarcely enough even for ourselves i have been obliged to make my husband lengthen the ropes every day for this week past if things go on at this rate there will soon be not one drop of water left in my well nor in any of the wells of the neighbourhood added one of the workmen who was standing by and he mentioned several in which the water had lately suddenly decreased and a miller affirmed that his mill had stopped for want of water francisco was struck by these remarks they brought to his recollection similar facts which he had often heard his father mention in his childhood as having been observed previous to the last eruption of mount vesuvius he had also heard from his father in his childhood that it is better to trust to prudence than to fortune and therefore though the peasants and workmen to whom he mentioned his fears laughed and said that as the burning mountain had been favourable to them for so many years they would trust to it and st januarius one day longer yet francisco immediately gave up all thoughts of spending this day amidst the ruins of herculaneum after having inquired sufficiently after having seen several wells in which the water had evidently decreased and after having seen the mill-wheels that were standing still for want of their usual supply he hastened home to his father and mother reported what he had heard and seen and begged of them to remove and to take what things of value they could to some distance from the dangerous spot where they now resided phil trans vol ix some of the inhabitants of resina whom he questioned declared that they had heard strange rumbling noises underground and a peasant and his son who had been at work the preceding day in a vineyard a little above the village related that they had seen a sudden puff of smoke come out of the earth close to them and that they had at the same time heard a noise like the going off of a pistol these facts are mentioned in sir william hamilton's account of an eruption of mount vesuvius -- see phil trans 1795 first part the villagers listened with large eyes and open ears to these relations yet such was their habitual attachment to the spot they lived upon or such the security in their own good fortune that few of them would believe that there could be any necessity for removing -- we'll see what will happen to-morrow we shall be safe here one day longer said they francisco's father and mother more prudent than the generality of their neighbours went to the house of a relation at some miles' distance from vesuvius and carried with them all their effects in the meantime francisco went to the villa where his english friends resided the villa was in a most dangerous situation near terre del greco -- a town that stands at the foot of mount vesuvius he related all the facts that he had heard to arthur who not having been like the inhabitants of resina familiarized to the idea of living in the vicinity of a burning mountain and habituated to trust in st januarius was sufficiently alarmed by francisco's representations he ran to his master's apartment and communicated all that he had just heard the count de flora and his lady who were at this time in the house ridiculed the fears of arthur and could not be prevailed upon to remove even as far as naples the lady was intent upon preparations for her birthday which was to be celebrated in a few days with great magnificence at their villa and she observed that it would be a pity to return to town before that day and they had everything arranged for the festival the prudent englishman had not the gallantry to appear to be convinced by these arguments and he left the place of danger he left it not too soon for the next morning exhibited a scene -- a scene which we shall not attempt to describe we refer our young readers to the account of this dreadful eruption of mount vesuvius published by sir w hamilton in the philosophical transactions it is sufficient here to say that in the space of about five hours the wretched inhabitants of torre del greco saw their town utterly destroyed by the streams of burning lava which poured from the mountain the villa of count de flora with some others which were at a little distance from the town escaped but they were absolutely surrounded by the lava the count and countess were obliged to fly from their house with the utmost precipitation in the night-time and they had not time to remove any of their furniture their plate clothes or jewels a few days after the eruption the surface of the lava became so cool that people could walk upon it though several feet beneath the surface it was still exceedingly hot numbers of those who had been forced from their houses now returned to the ruins to try to save whatever they could but these unfortunate persons frequently found their houses had been pillaged by robbers who in these moments of general confusion enrich themselves with the spoils of their fellow-creatures has the count abandoned his villa and is there no one to take care of his plate and furniture the house will certainly be ransacked before morning said the old carpenter to francisco who was at his house giving him an account of their flight francisco immediately went to the count's house in warn him of his danger the first person he saw was arthur who with a face of terror said to him do you know what has happened it is all over with resina all over with resina what has there been a fresh eruption has the lava reached resina no but it will inevitably be blown up there said arthur pointing to a thin figure of an italian who stood pale and trembling and looking up to heaven as he crossed himself repeatedly there said arthur is a man who has left a parcel of his cursed rockets and fireworks with i don't know how much gunpowder in the count's house from which we have just fled the wind blows that way one spark of fire and the whole is blown up francisco waited not to hear more but instantly without explaining his intentions to anyone set out for the count's villa and with a bucket of water in his hand crossed the beds of lava with which the house was encompassed when reaching the hall where the rockets and gunpowder were left he plunged them into the water and returned with them in safety over the lava yet warm under his feet what was the surprise and joy of the poor firework-maker when he saw francisco return from this dangerous expedition he could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw the rockets and the gunpowder all safe the count who had given up the hopes of saving his palace was in admiration when he heard of this instance of intrepidity which properly saved not only his villa but the whole village of resina from destruction these fireworks had been prepared for the celebration of the countess' birthday and were forgotten in the hurry of the night on which the inhabitants fled from torre del greco brave young man said the count to francisco i thank you and shall not limit my gratitude to thanks you tell me that there is danger of my villa being pillaged by robbers it is from this moment your interest as well as mine to prevent their depredations for trust to my liberality a portion of all that is saved of mine shall be yours bravo bravissimo exclaimed one who started from a recessed window in the hall where all this passed bravo bravissimo -- francisco thought he knew the voice and the countenance of this man who exclaimed with so much enthusiasm he remembered to have seen him before but when or where he could not recollect as soon as the count left the hall the stranger came up to francisco is it possible said he that you don't know me it is scarcely a twelvemonth since i drew tears from your eyes tears from my eyes repeated francisco smiling i have shed but few tears i have had but few misfortunes in my life the stranger answered him by two extempore italian lines which conveyed nearly the same idea that has been so well expressed by an english poet -- to each their sufferings -- all are men condemn'd alike to groan the feeling for another's woes th' unfeeling for his own i know you now perfectly well cried francisco you are the improvisatore who one fine moonlight night last summer told us the story of cornaro the turk the same said the improvisatore the same though in a better dress which i should not have thought would have made so much difference in your eyes though it makes all the difference between man and man in the eyes of the stupid vulgar my genius has broken through the clouds of misfortune of late a few happy impromptu verses i made on the count de flora's fall from his horse attracted attention the count patronizes me i am here now to learn the fate of an ode i have just composed for his lady's birthday my ode was to have been set to music and to have been performed at his villa near torre del greco if these troubles had not intervened now that the mountain is quiet again people will return to their senses i expect to be munificently rewarded but perhaps i detain you go i shall not forget to celebrate the heroic action you have performed this day i still amuse myself amongst the populace in my tattered garb late in the evenings and i shall sound your praises through naples in a poem i mean to recite on the late eruption of mount vesuvius adieu the improvisatore was as good as his word that evening with more than his usual enthusiasm he recited his verses to a great crowd of people in one of the public squares amongst the crowd were several to whom the name of francisco was well known and by whom he was well beloved these were his young companions who remembered him as a fruit-seller amongst the little merchants they rejoiced to hear his praises and repeated the lines with shouts of applause let us pass what is all this disturbance in the streets said a man pushing his way through the crowd a lad who held by his arm stopped suddenly on hearing the name of francisco which the people were repeating with so much enthusiasm ha i have found at last a story that interests you more than that of cornaro the turk cried the improvisatore looking in the face of the youth who had stopped so suddenly you are the young man who last summer had liked to have tricked me out of my new hat promise me you won't touch it now said he throwing down the hat at his feet or you hear not one word i have to say not one word of the heroic action performed at the villa of the count de flora near torre del greco this morning by signor francisco signor francisco repeated the lad with disdain well let us hear what you have to tell of him added he your hat is very safe i promise you i shall not touch it what of signor francisco signor francisco i may without impropriety call him said the improvisatore for he is likely to become rich enough to command the title from those who might not otherwise respect his merit likely to become rich how said the lad whom our readers have probably before this time discovered to be piedro how pray is he likely to become rich enough to be a signor the count de flora has promised him a liberal portion of all the fine furniture plate and jewels that can be saved from his villa at torre del greco francisco is gone down hither now with some of the count's domestics to protect the valuable goods against those villainous plunderers who robbed their fellow-creatures of what even the flames of vesuvius would spare come we have had enough of this stuff cried the man whose arm piedro held come away and he hurried forwards this man was one of the villains against whom the honest orator expressed such indignation he was one of those with whom piedro got acquainted during the time that he was living extravagantly upon the money he gained by the sale of the stolen diamond cross that robbery was not discovered and his success as he called it hardened him in guilt he was both unwilling and unable to withdraw himself from the bad company with whom his ill gotten wealth connected him he did not consider that bad company leads to the gallows la mala compagnia e quella che mena uomini a la forca the universal confusion which followed the eruption of mount vesuvius was to these villains a time of rejoicing no sooner did piedro's companion hear of the rich furniture plate etc which the imprudent orator had described as belonging to the count de flora's villa than he longed to make himself master of the whole it is a pity said piedro that the count has sent francisco with his servants down to guard it and who is this francisco of whom you seem to stand in so much awe a boy a young lad only of about my own age but i know him to be sturdily honest the servants we might corrupt but even the old proverb of 'angle with a silver hook ' won't hold good with him pescar col hamo d'argento and if he cannot be won by fair means he must be conquered by foul said the desperate villain but if we offer him rather more than the count has already promised for his share of the booty of course he will consult at once his safety and his interest no said piedro that is not his nature i know him from a child and we had better think of some other house for to-night's business none other none but this cried his companion with an oath my mind is determined upon this and you must obey your leader recollect the fate of him who failed me yesterday the person to whom he alluded was one of the gang of robbers who had been assassinated by his companions for hesitating to commit some crime suggested by their leader no tyranny is so dreadful as that which is exercised by villains over their young accomplices who become their slaves piedro who was of a cowardly nature trembled at the threatening countenance of his captain and promised submission in the course of the morning inquiries were made secretly amongst the count's servants and the two men who were engaged to sit up at the villa that night along with francisco were bribed to second the views of this gang of thieves it was agreed that about midnight the robbers should be let into the house that francisco should be tied hand and foot whilst they carried off their booty he is a stubborn chap though so young i understand said the captain of the robbers to his men but we carry poniards and know how to use them piedro you look pale you don't require to be reminded of what i said to you when we were alone just now piedro's voice failed and some of his comrades observed that he was young and new to the business the captain who from being his pretended friend during his wealthy days had of late become his tyrant cast a stern look at piedro and bid him be sure to be at the old jew's which was the place of meeting in the dusk of the evening after saying this he departed piedro when he was alone tried to collect his thoughts -- all his thoughts were full of horror where am i said he to himself what am i about did i understand rightly what he said about poniards francisco oh francisco excellent kind generous francisco yes i recollect your look when you held the bunch of grapes to my lips as i sat by the sea-shore deserted by all the world and now what friends have i robbers and -- the word murderers he could not utter he again recollected what had been said about poniards and the longer his mind fixed upon the words and the look that accompanied them the more he was shocked he could not doubt but that it was the serious intention of his accomplices to murder francisco if he should make any resistance piedro had at this moment no friend in the world to whom he could apply for advice or assistance his wretched father died some weeks before this time in a fit of intoxication piedro walked up and down the street scarcely capable of thinking much less of coming to any rational resolution the hours passed away the shadows of the houses lengthened under his footsteps the evening came on and when it grew dusk after hesitating in great agony of mind for some time his fear of the robbers' vengeance prevailed over every other feeling and he went at the appointed hour to the place of meeting the place of meeting was at the house of that jew to whom he several months before sold the diamond cross that cross which he thought himself so lucky to have stolen and to have disposed of undetected was in fact the cause of his being in his present dreadful situation it was at the jew's that he connected himself with this gang of robbers to whom he was now become an absolute slave oh that i dared to disobey said he to himself with a deep sigh as he knocked softly at the back door of the jew's house the back door opened into a narrow unfrequented street and some small rooms at this side of the house were set apart for the reception of guests who desired to have their business kept secret these rooms were separated by a dark passage from the rest of the house and numbers of people came to the shop in the front of the house which looked into a creditable street without knowing anything more from the ostensible appearance of the shop than that it was a kind of pawnbroker's where old clothes old iron and all sorts of refuse goods might be disposed of conveniently at the moment piedro knocked at the back door the front shop was full of customers and the jew's boy whose office it was to attend to these signals let piedro in told him that none of his comrades were yet come and left him in a room by himself he was pale and trembling and felt a cold dew spread over him he had a leaden image of saint januarius tied round his neck which in the midst of his wickedness he superstitiously preserved as a sort of charm and on this he kept his eyes stupidly fixed as he sat alone in this gloomy place he listened from time to time but he heard no noise at the side of the house where he was his accomplices did not arrive and in a sort of impatient terror the attendant upon an evil conscience he flung open the door of his cell and groped his way through the passage which he knew led to the public shop he longed to hear some noise and to mix with the living the jew when piedro entered the shop was bargaining with a poor thin-looking man about some gunpowder i don't deny that it has been wet said the man but since it was in the bucket of water it has been carefully dried i tell you the simple truth that so soon after the grand eruption of mount vesuvius the people of naples will not relish fireworks my poor little rockets and even my catherine-wheels will have no effect i am glad to part with all i have in this line of business a few days ago i had fine things in readiness for the countess de flora's birthday which was to have been celebrated at the count's villa why do you fix your eyes on me friend what is your discourse to me said piedro who imagined that the man fixed his eyes upon him as he mentioned the name of the count's villa i did not know that i fixed my eyes upon you i was thinking of my fireworks said the poor man simply but now that i do look at you and hear your voice i recollect having had the pleasure of seeing you before when where said piedro a great while ago no wonder you have forgotten me said the man but i can recall the night to your recollection you were in the street with me the night i let off that unlucky rocket which frightened the horses and was the cause of overturning a lady's coach don't you remember the circumstance i have a confused recollection of some such thing said piedro in great embarrassment and he looked suspiciously at this man in doubt whether he was cunning and wanted to sound him or whether he was so simple as he appeared you did not perhaps hear then continued the man that there was a great search made after the overturn for a fine diamond cross belonging to the lady in the carriage that lady though i did not know it till lately was the countess de flora i know nothing of the matter interrupted piedro in great agitation his confusion was so marked that the firework-maker could not avoid taking notice of it and a silence of some moments ensued the jew more practised in dissimulation than piedro endeavoured to turn the man's attention back to his rockets and his gunpowder -- agreed to take the gunpowder -- paid for it in haste and was though apparently unconcerned eager to get rid of him but this was not so easily done the man's curiosity was excited and his suspicions of piedro were increased every moment by all the dark changes of his countenance piedro overpowered with the sense of guilt surprised at the unexpected mention of the diamond cross and of the count de flora's villa stood like one convicted and seemed fixed to the spot without power of motion i want to look at the old cambric that you said you had -- that would do for making -- that you could let me have cheap for artificial flowers said the firework-maker to the jew and as he spoke his eye from time to time looked towards piedro piedro felt for the leaden image of the saint which he wore round his neck the string which held it cracked and broke with the pull he gave it this slight circumstance affected his terrified and superstitious mind more than all the rest he imagined that at this moment his fate was decided that saint januarius deserted him and that he was undone he precipitately followed the firework-man the instant he left the shop and seizing hold of his arm whispered i must speak to you speak then said the man astonished not here this way said he drawing him towards the dark passage what i have to say must not be overheard you are going to the count de flora's are not you i am said the man he was going there to speak to the countess about some artificial flowers but piedro thought he was going to speak to her about the diamond cross you are going to give information against me nay hear me i confess that i purloined that diamond cross but i can do the count a great service upon condition that he pardons me his villa is to be attacked this night by four well armed men they will set out five hours hence i am compelled under the threat of assassination to accompany them but i shall do no more i throw myself upon the count's mercy hasten to him -- we have no time to lose the poor man who heard this confession escaped from piedro the moment he loosed his arm with all possible expedition he ran to the count's palace in naples and related to him all that had been said by piedro some of the count's servants on whom he could most depend were at a distant part of the city attending their mistress but the english gentleman offered the services of his man arthur arthur no sooner heard the business and understood that francisco was in danger than he armed himself without saying one word saddled his english horse and was ready to depart before anyone else had finished their exclamations and conjectures but we are not to set out yet said the servant it is but four miles to torre del greco the sbirri officers of justice are summoned -- they are to go with us -- we must wait for them they waited much against arthur's inclination a considerable time for these sbirri at length they set out and just as they reached the villa the flash of the pistol was seen from one of the apartments in the house the robbers were there this pistol was snapped by their captain at poor francisco who had bravely asserted that he would as long as he had life defend the property committed to his care the pistol missed fire for it was charged with some of the damaged powder which the jew had bought that evening from the firework maker and which he had sold as excellent immediately afterwards to his favourite customers -- the robbers who met at his house arthur as soon as he perceived the flash of the piece pressed forward through all the apartments followed by the count's servants and the officers of justice at the sudden appearance of so many armed men the robbers stood dismayed arthur eagerly shook francisco's hand congratulating him upon his safety and did not perceive till he had given him several rough friendly shakes that his arm was wounded and that he was pale with the loss of blood it is not much -- only a slight wound said francisco one that i should have escaped if i had been upon my guard but the sight of a face that i little expected to see in such company took from me all presence of mind and one of the ruffians stabbed me here in the arm whilst i stood in stupid astonishment oh take me to prison take me to prison -- i am weary of life -- i am a wretch not fit to live cried piedro holding his hands to be tied by the sbirri the next morning piedro was conveyed to prison and as he passed through the streets of naples he was met by several of those who had known him when he was a child ay said they as he went by his father encouraged him in cheating when he was but a child and see what he is come to now he is a man he was ordered to remain twelve months in solitary confinement his captain and his accomplices were sent to the galleys and the jew was banished from naples and now having got these villains out of the way let us return to honest francisco his wound was soon healed arthur was no bad surgeon for he let his patient get well as fast as he pleased and carlo and rosetta nursed him with so much kindness that he was almost sorry to find himself perfectly recovered now that you are able to go out said francisco's father to him you must come and look at my new house my dear son your new house father yes son and a charming one it is and a handsome piece of land near it -- all at a safe distance too from mount vesuvius and can you guess how i came by it -- it was given to me for having a good son yes cried carlo the inhabitants of resina and several who had property near terre del greco and whose houses and lives were saved by your intrepidity in carrying the materials for the fireworks and the gunpowder out of this dangerous place went in a body to the duke and requested that he would mention your name and these facts to the king who amongst the grants he has made to the sufferers by the late eruption of mount vesuvius has been pleased to say that he gives this house and garden to your father because you have saved the property and lives of many of his subjects the value of a handsome portion of furniture plate etc in the count de flora's villa was according to the count's promise given to him and this money he divided between his own family and that of the good carpenter who first put a pencil into his hands arthur would not accept of any present from him to mr lee the english gentleman he offered one of his own drawings -- a fruit-piece i like this very well said arthur as he examined the drawing but i should like this melon better if it was a little bruised it is now three years ago since i was going to buy that bruised melon from you you showed me your honest nature then though you were but a boy and i have found you the same ever since a good beginning makes a good ending -- an honest boy will make an honest man and honesty is the best policy as you have proved to all who wanted the proof i hope yes added francisco's father i think it is pretty plain that piedro the cunning has not managed quite so well as francisco the honest tarlton delightful task to rear the tender thought -- to teach the young idea how to shoot -- to pour the fresh instruction o'er the mind -- to breathe th' enlivening spirit -- and to fix the generous purpose in the glowing breast thomson young hardy was educated by mr freeman a very excellent master at one of our rural sunday schools he was honest obedient active and good- natured hence he was esteemed by his master and being beloved by all his companions who were good he did not desire to be loved by the bad nor was he at all vexed or ashamed when idle mischievous or dishonest boys attempted to plague or ridicule him his friend loveit on the contrary wished to be universally liked and his highest ambition was to be thought the best natured boy in the school -- and so he was he usually went by the name of poor loveit and everybody pitied him when he got into disgrace which he frequently did for though he had a good disposition he was led to do things which he knew to be wrong merely because he could never have the courage to say no because he was afraid to offend the ill-natured and could not bear to be laughed at by fools one fine autumn evening all the boys were permitted to go out to play in a pleasant green meadow near the school loveit and another boy called tarlton began to play a game of battledore and shuttlecock and a large party stood by to look on for they were the best players at battledore and shuttlecock in the school and this was a trial of skill between them when they had got it up to three hundred and twenty the game became very interesting the arms of the combatants tired that they could scarcely wield the battledores the shuttlecock began to waver in the air now it almost touched the ground and now to the astonishment of the spectators mounted again high over their heads yet the strokes became feebler and feebler and now loveit now tarlton resounded on all sides for another minute the victory was doubtful but at length the setting sun shining full in loveit's face so dazzled his eyes that he could no longer see the shuttlecock and it fell at his feet after the first shout for tarlton's triumph was over everybody exclaimed poor loveit he's the best natured fellow in the world what a pity that he did not stand with his back to the sun now i dare you all to play another game with me cried tarlton vauntingly and as he spoke he tossed the shuttlecock up with all his force -- with so much force that it went over the hedge and dropped into a lane which went close beside the field hey-day said tarlton what shall we do now the boys were strictly forbidden to go into the lane and it was upon their promise not to break this command that they were allowed to play in the adjoining field no other shuttlecock was to be had and their play was stopped they stood on the top of the bank peeping over the hedge i see it yonder said tarlton i wish somebody would get it one could get over the gate at the bottom of the field and be back again in half a minute added he looking at loveit but you know we must not go into the lane said loveit hesitatingly pugh said tarlton why now what harm could it do i don't know said loveit drumming upon his battledore but -- you don't know man why then what are you afraid of i ask you loveit coloured went on drumming and again in a lower voice said he didn't know but upon tarlton's repeating in a more insolent tone i ask you man what you're afraid of he suddenly left off drumming and looking round said he was not afraid of anything that he knew of yes but you are said hardy coming forward am i said loveit of what pray am i afraid of doing wrong afraid of doing wrong repeated tarlton mimicking him so that he made everybody laugh now hadn't you better say afraid of being flogged no said hardy coolly after the laugh had somewhat subsided i am as little afraid of being flogged as you are tarlton but i meant -- no matter what you meant why should you interfere with your wisdom and your meanings nobody thought of asking you to stir a step for us but we asked loveit because he's the best fellow in the world and for that very reason you should not ask him because you know he can't refuse you anything indeed though cried loveit piqued there you're mistaken for i could refuse if i chose it hardy smiled and loveit half afraid of his contempt and half afraid of tarlton's ridicule stood doubtful and again had recourse to his battledore which he balanced most curiously upon his forefinger look at him -- now do look at him cried tarlton did you ever in your life see anybody look so silly -- hardy has him quite under his thumb he's so mortally afraid of parson prig that he dare not for the soul of him turn either of his eyes from the tip of his nose look how he squints i don't squint said loveit looking up and nobody has me under his thumb and what hardy said was only for fear i should get in disgrace he's the best friend i have loveit spoke this with more than usual spirit for both his heart and his pride were touched come along then said hardy taking him by the arm in an affectionate manner and he was just going when tarlton called after him ay go along with its best friend and take care it does not get into a scrape - -good-bye little panado whom do they call little panado said loveit turning his head hastily back never mind said hardy what does it signify no said loveit to be sure it does not signify but one does not like to be called little panado besides added he after going a few steps farther they'll all think it so ill-natured i had better go back and just tell them that i'm very sorry i can't get their shuttlecock do come back with me no said hardy i can't go back and you'd better not but i assure you i won't stay a minute wait for me added loveit and he slunk back again to prove that he was not little panado once returned the rest followed of course for to support his character of good-nature he was obliged to yield to the entreaties of his companions and to show his spirit leapt over the gate amidst the acclamations of the little mob -- he was quickly out of sight here cried he returning in about five minutes quite out of breath i've got the shuttlecock and i'll tell you what i've seen cried he panting for breath what cried everybody eagerly why just at the turn of the corner at the end of the lane -- panting well said tarlton impatiently do go on let me just take breath first pugh -- never mind your breath well then just at the turn of the corner at the end of the lane as i was looking about for the shuttlecock i heard a great rustling somewhere near me and so i looked where it could come from and i saw in a nice little garden on the opposite side of the way a boy about as big as tarlton sitting in a great tree shaking the branches so i called to the boy to beg one but he said he could not give me one for that they were his grandfather's and just at that minute from behind a gooseberry bush up popped the uncle the grandfather poked his head out of the window so i ran off as fast as my legs would carry me though i heard him bawling after me all the way and let him bawl cried tarlton he shan't bawl for nothing i'm determined we'll have some of his fine large rosy apples before i sleep to-night at this speech a general silence ensued everybody kept their eyes fixed upon tarlton except loveit who looked down apprehensive that he should be drawn on much farther than he intended oh indeed said he to himself as hardy told me i had better not have come back regardless of this confusion tarlton continued but before i say any more i hope we have no spies amongst us if there is any one of you afraid to be flogged let him march off this instant loveit coloured bit his lips wished to go but had not the courage to move first he waited to see what everybody else would do nobody stirred so loveit stood still well then cried tarlton giving his hand to the boy next him then to the next your word and honour that you won't betray me but stand by me and i'll stand by you each boy gave his hand and his promise repeating stand by me and i'll stand by you loveit hung back till the last and had almost twisted off the button of the boy's coat who screened him when tarlton came up holding out his hand come loveit lad you're in for it stand by me and i'll stand by you indeed tarlton expostulated he without looking him in the face i do wish you'd give up this scheme i daresay all the apples are gone by this time i wish you would do pray give up this scheme what scheme man you have'n't heard it yet you may as well know your text before you begin preaching the corners of loveit's mouth could not refuse to smile though in his heart he felt not the slightest inclination to laugh why i don't know you i declare i don't know you to-day said tarlton you used to be the best natured most agreeable lad in the world and would do anything one asked you but you're quite altered of late as we were saying just now when you skulked away with hardy come -- do man pluck up a little spirit and be one of us or you'll make us all hate you hate me repeated loveit with terror no surely you won't all hate me and he mechanically stretched out his hand which tarlton shook violently saying ay now that's right ay now that's wrong whispered loveit's conscience but his conscience was of no use to him for it was always overpowered by the voice of numbers and though he had the wish he never had the power to do right poor loveit i knew he would not refuse us cried his companions and even tarlton the moment he shook hands with him despised him it is certain that weakness of mind is despised both by the good and the bad the league being thus formed tarlton assumed all the airs of commander explained his schemes and laid the plan of attack upon the poor old man's apple-tree it was the only one he had the world we shall not dwell upon their consultation for the amusement of contriving such expeditions is often the chief thing which induces idle boys to engage in them there was a small window at the end of the back staircase through which between nine and ten o'clock at night tarlton accompanied by loveit and another boy crept out it was a moonlight night and after crossing the field and climbing the gate directed by loveit who now resolved to go through the affair with spirit they proceeded down the lane with rash yet fearful steps at a distance loveit saw the white washed cottage and the apple-tree beside it they quickened their pace and with some difficulty scrambled through the hedge which fenced the garden though not without being scratched and torn by the briers everything was silent yet now and then at every rustling of the leaves they started and their hearts beat violently once as loveit was climbing the apple-tree he thought he heard a door in the cottage open and earnestly begged his companions to desist and return home this however he could by no means persuade them to do until they had filled their pockets with apples then to his great joy they returned crept in at the window and each retired as softly as possible to his own apartment loveit slept in the room with hardy whom he had left fast asleep and whom he now was extremely afraid of awakening all the apples were emptied out of loveit's pockets and lodged with tarlton till the morning for fear the smell should betray the secret to hardy the room door was apt to creak but it was opened with such precaution that no noise could be heard and loveit found his friend as fast asleep as when he left him ah said he to himself how quietly he sleeps i wish i had been sleeping too the reproaches of loveit's conscience however served no other purpose but to torment him he had not sufficient strength of mind to be good the very next night in spite of all his fears and all his penitence and all his resolutions by a little fresh ridicule and persuasion he was induced to accompany the same party on a similar expedition we must observe that the necessity for continuing their depredations became stronger the third day for though at first only a small party had been in the secret by degrees it was divulged to the whole school and it was necessary to secure secrecy by sharing the booty everyone was astonished that hardy with all his quickness and penetration had not yet discovered their proceedings but loveit could not help suspecting that he was not quite so ignorant as he appeared to be loveit had strictly kept his promise of secrecy but he was by no means an artful boy and in talking to his friend conscious that he had something to conceal he was perpetually on the point of betraying himself then recollecting his engagement he blushed stammered bungled and upon hardy's asking what he meant would answer with a silly guilty countenance that he did not know or abruptly break off saying oh nothing nothing at all it was in vain that he urged tarlton to permit him to consult his friend a gloom overspread tarlton's brow when he began to speak on the subject and he always returned a peremptory refusal accompanied with some such taunting expression as this -- i wish we had nothing to do with such a sneaking fellow he'll betray us all i see before we have done with him well said loveit to himself so i am abused after all and called a sneaking fellow for my pains that's rather hard to be sure when i've got so little by the job in truth he had not got much for in the division of the booty only one apple and half of another which was only half ripe happened to fall to his share though to be sure when they had all eaten their apples he had the satisfaction to hear everybody declare they were very sorry they had forgotten to offer some of theirs to poor loveit in the meantime the visits to the apple-tree had been now too frequently repeated to remain concealed from the old man who lived in the cottage he used to examine his only tree very frequently and missing numbers of rosy apples which he had watched ripening he though not prone to suspicion began to think that there was something going wrong especially as a gap was made in his hedge and there were several small footsteps in his flower beds the good old man was not at all inclined to give pain to any living creature much less to children of whom he was particularly fond nor was he in the least avaricious for though he was not rich he had enough to live upon because he had been very industrious in his youth and he was always very ready to part with the little he had nor was he a cross old man if anything would have made him angry it would have been the seeing his favourite tree robbed as he had promised himself the pleasure of giving his red apples to his grandchildren on his birthday however he looked up at the tree in sorrow rather than in anger and leaning upon his staff he began to consider what he had best do if i complain to their master said he to himself they will certainly be flogged and that i should be sorry for yet they must not be let to go on stealing that would be worse still for it would surely bring them to the gallows in the end let me see -- oh ay that will do i will borrow farmer kent's dog barker he'll keep them off i'll answer for it farmer kent lent his dog barker cautioning his neighbour at the same time to be sure to chain him well for he was the fiercest mastiff in england the old man with farmer kent's assistance chained him fast to the trunk of the apple-tree night came and tarlton loveit and his companions returned at the usual hour grown bolder now by frequent success they came on talking and laughing but the moment they had set their foot in the garden the dog started up and shaking the chain as he sprang forward barked with unremitting fury they stood still as if fixed to the spot there was just moonlight enough to see the dog let us try the other side of the tree said tarlton but to whichever side they turned the dog flew round in an instant barking with increased fury he'll break his chain and tear us to pieces cried tarlton and struck with terror he immediately threw down the basket he had brought with him and betook himself to flight with the greatest precipitation help me oh pray help me i can't get through the hedge cried loveit in a lamentable tone whilst the dog growled hideously and sprang forward to the extremity of his chain i can't get out oh for god's sake stay for me one minute dear tarlton he called in vain he was left to struggle through his difficulties by himself and of all his dear friends not one turned back to help him at last torn and terrified he got through the hedge and ran home despising his companions for their selfishness nor could he help observing that tarlton with all his vaunted prowess was the first to run away from the appearance of danger the next morning loveit could not help reproaching the party with their conduct why could not you any of you stay one minute to help me said he we did not hear you call answered one i was so frightened said another i would not have turned back for the whole world and you tarlton i said tarlton had not i enough to do to take care of myself you blockhead everyone for himself in this world so i see said loveit gravely well man is there anything strange in that strange why yes i thought you all loved me lord love you lad so we do but we love ourselves better hardy would not have served me so however said loveit turning away in disgust tarlton was alarmed pugh said he what nonsense have you taken into your brain think no more about it we are all very sorry and beg your pardon come shake hands forgive and forget loveit gave his hand but gave it rather coldly i forgive it with all my heart said he but i cannot forget it so soon why then you are not such a good humoured fellow as we thought you were surely you cannot bear malice loveit loveit smiled and allowed that he certainly could not bear malice well then come you know at the bottom we all love you and would do anything in the world for you poor loveit flattered in his foible began to believe that they did love him at the bottom as they said and even with his eyes open consented again to be duped how strange it is thought he that i should set such value upon the love of those i despise when i'm once out of this scrape i'll have no more to do with them i'm determined compared with his friend hardy his new associates did indeed appear contemptible for all this time hardy had treated him with uniform kindness avoided to pry into his secrets yet seemed ready to receive his confidence if it had been offered after school in the evening as he was standing silently beside hardy who was ruling a sheet of paper for him tarlton in his brutal manner came up and seizing him by the arm cried come along with me loveit i've something to say to you i can't come now said loveit drawing away his arm ah do come now said tarlton in a voice of persuasion well i'll come presently nay but do pray there's a good fellow come now because i have something to say to you what is it you've got to say to me i wish you'd let me alone said loveit yet at the same time he suffered himself to he led away tarlton took particular pains to humour him and bring him into temper again and even though he was not very apt to part with his playthings went so far as to say loveit the other day you wanted a top i'll give you mine if you desire it loveit thanked him and was overjoyed at the thought of possessing this top but what did you want to say to me just now ay we'll talk of that presently not yet -- when we get out of hearing nobody is near us said loveit come a little farther however said tarlton looking round suspiciously well now well you know the dog that frightened us last night yes it will never frighten us again won't it how so look here said tarlton drawing something from his pocket wrapped in a blue handkerchief what's that tarlton opened it raw meat exclaimed loveit how came you by it tom the servant boy tom got it for me and i'm to give him sixpence and is it for the dog yes i vowed i'd be revenged on him and after this he'll never bark again never bark again what do you mean is it poison exclaimed loveit starting back with horror only poison for a dog said tarlton confused you could not look more shocking if it was poison for a christian loveit stood for nearly a minute in profound silence tarlton said he at last in a changed tone and altered manner i did not know you i will have no more to do with you nay but stay said tarlton catching hold of his arm stay i was only joking let go my arm -- you were in earnest but then that was before i knew there was any harm if you think there's any harm if said loveit why you know i might not know for tom told me it's a thing that's often done ask tom i'll ask nobody surely we know better what's right and wrong than tom does but only just ask him to hear what he'll say i don't want to hear what he'll say cried loveit vehemently the dog will die in agonies -- in agonies there was a dog poisoned at my father's -- i saw him in the yard poor creature he lay and howled and writhed himself poor creature well there's no harm done now cried tarlton in a hypocritical tone but though he thought fit to dissemble with loveit he was thoroughly determined in his purpose poor loveit in haste to get away returned to his friend hardy but his mind was in such agitation that he neither talked nor moved like himself and two or three times his heart was so full that he was ready to burst into tears how good-natured you are to me said he to hardy as he was trying vainly to entertain him but if you knew -- here he stopped short for the bell for evening prayer rang and they all took their places and knelt down after prayers as they were going to bed loveit stopped tarlton -- well asked he in an inquiring manner fixing his eyes upon him well replied tarlton in an audacious tone as if he meant to set his inquiring eye at defiance what do you mean to do to-night to go to sleep as you do i suppose replied tarlton turning away abruptly and whistling as he walked off oh he has certainly changed his mind said loveit to himself else he could not whistle about ten minutes after this as he and hardy were undressing hardy suddenly recollected that he had left his new kite out upon the grass oh said he it will be quite spoiled before morning call tom said loveit and bid him bring it in for you in a minute they both went to the top of the stairs to call tom no one answered they called again louder is tom below i'm here answered he at last coming out of tarlton's room with a look of mixed embarrassment and effrontery and as he was receiving hardy's commission loveit saw the corner of the blue handkerchief hanging out of his pocket this excited fresh suspicions in loveit's mind but without saying one word he immediately stationed himself at the window in his room which looked out towards the lane and as the moon was risen he could see if anyone passed that way what are you doing there said hardy after he had been watching some time why don't you come to bed loveit returned no answer but continued standing at the window nor did he watch long in vain presently he saw tom gliding slowly along a by-path and get over the gate into the lane he's gone to do it exclaimed loveit aloud with an emotion which he could not command who's gone to do what cried hardy starting up how cruel how wicked continued loveit what's cruel -- what's wicked speak out at once returned hardy in that commanding tone which in moments of danger strong minds feel themselves entitled to assume towards weak ones loveit instantly though in an incoherent manner explained the affair to him scarcely had the words passed his lips when hardy sprang up and began dressing himself without saying one syllable for god's sake what are you going to do said loveit in great anxiety they'll never forgive me don't betray me they'll never forgive pray speak to me only say you won't betray us i will not betray you trust to me said hardy and he left the room and loveit stood in amazement while in the meantime hardy in hopes of overtaking tom before the fate of the poor dog was decided ran with all possible speed across the meadow then down the lane he came up with tom just as he was climbing the bank into the old man's garden hardy too much out of breath to speak seized hold of him dragged him down detaining him with a firm grasp whilst he panted for utterance what master hardy is it you what's the matter what do you want i want the poisoned meat that you have in your pocket who told you that i had any such thing said tom clapping his hand upon his guilty pocket give it me quietly and i'll let you off sir upon my word i haven't i didn't i don't know what you mean said tom trembling though he was by far the stronger of the two indeed i don't know what you mean you do said hardy with great indignation and a violent struggle immediately commenced the dog now alarmed by the voices began to bark outrageously tom was terrified lest the old man should come out to see what was the matter his strength forsook him and flinging the handkerchief and meat over the hedge he ran away with all his speed the handkerchief fell within reach of the dog who instantly snapped at it luckily it did not come untied hardy saw a pitchfork on a dunghill close beside him and seizing upon it stuck it into the handkerchief the dog pulled tore growled grappled yelled it was impossible to get the handkerchief from between his teeth but the knot was loosed the meat unperceived by the dog dropped out and while he dragged off the handkerchief in triumph hardy with inexpressible joy plunged the pitchfork into the poisoned meat and bore it away never did hero retire with more satisfaction from a field of battle full of the pleasure of successful benevolence hardy tripped joyfully home and vaulted over the window sill when the first object he beheld was mr power the usher standing at the head of the stairs with his candle in his hand come up whoever you are said mr william power in a stern voice i thought i should find you out at last come up whoever you are hardy obeyed without reply -- hardy exclaimed mr power starting back with astonishment is it you mr hardy repeated he holding the light to his face why sir said he in a sneering tone i'm sure if mr trueman was here he wouldn't believe his own eyes but for my part i saw through you long since i never liked saints for my share will you please to do me the favour sir if it is not too much trouble to empty your pockets hardy obeyed in silence heyday meat raw meat what next that's all said hardy emptying his pockets inside out this is all said mr power taking up the meat pray sir said hardy eagerly let that meat be burned it is poisoned poisoned cried mr william power letting it drop out of his fingers you wretch looking at him with a menacing air what is all this speak hardy was silent why don't you speak cried he shaking him by the shoulder impatiently still hardy was silent down upon your knees this minute and confess all tell me where you've been what you've been doing and who are your accomplices for i know there is a gang of you so added he pressing heavily upon hardy's shoulder down upon your knees this minute and confess the whole that's your only way now to get off yourself if you hope for my pardon i can tell you it's not to be had without asking for sir said hardy in a firm but respectful voice i have no pardon to ask i have nothing to confess i am innocent but if i were not i would never try to get off myself by betraying my companions very well sir very well very fine stick to it stick to it i advise you and we shall see and how will you look to-morrow mr innocent when my uncle the doctor comes home as i do now sir said hardy unmoved his composure threw mr power into a rage too great for utterance sir continued hardy ever since i have been at school i never told a lie and therefore sir i hope you will believe me now upon my word and honour sir i have done nothing wrong nothing wrong better and better what when i caught you going out at night that to be sure was wrong said hardy recollecting himself but except that -- except that sir i will except nothing come along with me young gentleman your time for pardon is past saying these words he pulled hardy along a narrow passage to a small closet set apart for desperate offenders and usually known by the name of the black hole there sir take up your lodging there for to- night said he pushing him in tomorrow i'll know more or i'll know why added he double locking the door with a tremendous noise upon his prisoner and locking also the door at the end of the passage so that no one could have access to him so now i think i have you safe said mr william power to himself stalking off with steps which made the whole gallery resound and which made many a guilty heart tremble the conversation which had passed between hardy and mr power at the head of the stairs had been anxiously listened to but only a word or two here and there had been distinctly overheard the locking of the black hole door was a terrible sound -- some knew not what it portended and others knew too well all assembled in the morning with faces of anxiety tarlton and loveit's were the most agitated tarlton for himself loveit for his friend for himself for everybody every one of the party and tarlton at their head surrounded him with reproaches and considered him as the author of the evils which hung over them how could you do so and why did you say anything to hardy about it when you had promised too oh what shall we all do what a scrape you have brought us into loveit it's all your fault all my fault repeated poor loveit with a sigh well that is hard goodness there's the bell exclaimed a number of voices at once now for it they all stood in a half circle for morning prayers they listened -- here he is coming no -- yes -- here he is and mr william power with a gloomy brow appeared and walked up to his place at the head of the room they knelt down to prayers and the moment they rose mr william power laying his hand upon the table cried stand still gentlemen if you please everybody stood stock still he walked out of the circle they guessed that he was gone for hardy and the whole room was in commotion each with eagerness asked each what none could answer has he told what has he told who has he told of i hope he has not told of me cried they i'll answer for it he has told of all of us said tarlton and i'll answer for it he has told of none of us answered loveit with a sigh you don't think he's such a fool when he can get himself off said tarlton at this instant the prisoner was led in and as he passed through the circle every eye was fixed upon him his eye fell upon no one not even upon loveit who pulled him by the coat as he passed -- everyone felt almost afraid to breathe well sir said mr power sitting down in mr trueman's elbow-chair and placing the prisoner opposite to him well sir what have you to say to me this morning nothing sir answered hardy in a decided yet modest manner nothing but what i said last night nothing more nothing more sir but i have something more to say to you sir then and a great deal more i promise you before i have done with you and then seizing him in a fury he was just going to give him a severe flogging when the schoolroom door opened and mr trueman appeared followed by an old man whom loveit immediately knew he leaned upon his stick as he walked and in his other hand carried a basket of apples when they came within the circle mr trueman stopped short hardy exclaimed he with a voice of unfeigned surprise whilst mr william power stood with his hand suspended -- ay hardy sir repeated he i told him you'd not believe your own eyes mr trueman advanced with a slow step now sir give me leave said the usher eagerly drawing him aside and whispering so sir said mr t when the whisper was done addressing himself to hardy with a voice and manner which had he been guilty must have pierced him to the heart i find i have been deceived in you it is but three hours ago that i told your uncle i never had a boy in my school in whom i placed so much confidence but after all this show of honour and integrity the moment my back is turned you are the first to set an example of disobedience of my orders why do i talk of disobeying my commands -- you are a thief i sir exclaimed hardy no longer able to repress his feelings you sir -- you and some others said mr trueman looking round the room with a penetrating glance -- you and some others ay sir interrupted mr william power get that out of him if you can -- ask him i will ask him nothing i shall neither put his truth nor his honour to the trial truth and honour are not to be expected amongst thieves i am not a thief i have never had anything to do with thieves cried hardy indignantly have you not robbed this old man don't you know the taste of these apples said mr trueman taking one out of the basket no sir i do not i never touched one of that old man's apples never touched one of them i suppose this is some vile equivocation you have done worse you have had the barbarity the baseness to attempt to poison his dog the poisoned meat was found in your pocket last night the poisoned meat was found in my pocket sir but i never intended to poison the dog -- i saved his life lord bless him said the old man nonsense -- cunning said mr power i hope you won't let him impose upon you sir no he cannot impose upon me i have a proof he is little prepared for said mr trueman producing the blue handkerchief in which the meat had been wrapped tarlton turned pale hardy's countenance never changed don't you know this handkerchief sir i do sir is it not yours no sir don't you know whose it is cried mr power hardy was silent now gentlemen said mr trueman i am not fond of punishing you but when i do it you know it is always in earnest i will begin with the eldest of you i will begin with hardy and flog you with my own hands till this handkerchief is owned i'm sure it's not mine and i'm sure it's none of mine burst from every mouth whilst they looked at each other in dismay for none but hardy loveit and tarlton knew the secret my cane said mr trueman and mr power handed him the cane loveit groaned from the bottom of his heart tarlton leaned back against the wall with a black countenance hardy looked with a steady eye at the cane but first said mr trueman laying down the cane let us see perhaps we may find out the owner of this handkerchief another way examining the corners it was torn almost to pieces but luckily the corner that was marked remained j t cried mr trueman every eye turned upon the guilty tarlton who now as pale as ashes and trembling in every limb sank down upon his knees and in a whining voice begged for mercy upon my word and honour sir i'll tell you all i'd never have thought of stealing the apples if loveit had not first told me of them and it was tom who first put the poisoning the dog into my head it was he that carried the meat wasn't it said he appealing to hardy whose word he knew must be believed oh dear sir continued he as mr trueman began to move towards him do let me off pray do let me off this time i'm not the only one indeed sir i hope you won't make me an example for the rest it's very hard i'm to be flogged more than they i'm not going to flog you thank you sir said tarlton getting up and wiping his eyes you need not thank me said mr trueman take your handkerchief -- go out of this room -- out of this house let me never see you more if i had any hopes of him said mr trueman as he shut the door after him -- if i had any hopes of him i would have punished him -- but i have none punishment is meant only to make people better and those who have any hopes of themselves will know how to submit to it at these words loveit first and immediately all the rest of the guilty party stepped out of the ranks confessed their fault and declared themselves ready to bear any punishment their master thought proper oh they have been punished enough said the old man forgive them sir hardy looked as if he wished to speak not because you ask it said mr trueman to the guilty penitents though i should be glad to oblige you -- it wouldn't be just but there pointing to hardy there is one who has merited a reward the highest i can give him is that of pardoning his companions hardy bowed and his face glowed with pleasure whilst everybody present sympathized in his feelings i am sure thought loveit this is a lesson i shall never forget gentlemen said the old man with a faltering voice it wasn't for the sake of my apples that i spoke and you sir said he to hardy i thank you for saving my dog if you please i'll plant on that mount opposite the window a young apple-tree from my old one i will water it and take care of it with my own hands for your sake as long as i am able and may god bless you laying his trembling hand on hardy's head may god bless you -- i'm sure god will bless all such boys as you are the basket-woman toute leur etude etait de se complaire et de s'entr'aider paul et virginie at the foot of a steep slippery white hill near dunstable in bedfordshire called chalk hill there is a hut or rather a hovel which travellers could scarcely suppose could be inhabited if they did not see the smoke rising from its peaked roof an old woman lives in this hovel and with her a little boy and girl the children of a beggar who died and left these orphans perishing with hunger they thought themselves very happy when the good old woman first took them into her hut and bid them warm themselves at her small fire and gave them a crust of mouldy bread to eat she had not much to give but what she had she gave with good-will she was very kind to these poor children and worked hard at her spinning-wheel and at her knitting to support herself and them she earned money also in another way she used to follow all the carriages as they went up chalk hill and when the horses stopped to take breath or to rest themselves she put stones behind the carriage wheels to prevent them from rolling backwards down the steep slippery hill their whole study was how to please and to help one another this was about the close of the 18th century the little boy and girl loved to stand beside the good natured old woman's spinning-wheel when she was spinning and to talk to her at these times she taught them something which she said she hoped they would remember all their lives she explained to them what is meant by telling the truth and what it is to be honest she taught them to dislike idleness and to wish that they could be useful one evening as they were standing beside her the little boy said to her grandmother for that was the name by which she liked that these children should call her -- grandmother how often you are forced to get up from your spinning-wheel and to follow the chaises and coaches up that steep hill to put stones underneath the wheels to hinder them from rolling back the people who are in the carriages give you a halfpenny or a penny for doing this don't they yes child but it is very hard work for you to go up and down that hill you often say that you are tired and then you know that you cannot spin all that time now if we might go up the hill and put the stones behind the wheels you could sit still at your work and would not the people give us the halfpence and could not we bring them all to you do pray dear grandmother try us for one day -- to-morrow will you yes said the old woman i will try what you can do but i must go up the hill along with you for the first two or three times for fear you should get yourselves hurt so the next day the little boy and girl went with their grandmother as they used to call her up the steep hill and she showed the boy how to prevent the wheels from rolling back by putting stones behind them and she said this is called scotching the wheels and she took off the boy's hat and gave it to the little girl to hold up to the carriage- windows ready for the halfpence when she thought that the children knew how to manage by themselves she left them and returned to her spinning-wheel a great many carriages happened to go by this day and the little girl received a great many halfpence she carried them all in her brother's hat to her grandmother in the evening and the old woman smiled and thanked the children she said that they had been useful to her and that her spinning had gone on finely because she had been able to sit still at her wheel all day but paul my boy said she what is the matter with your hand only a pinch -- only one pinch that i got as i was putting a stone behind a wheel of a chaise it does not hurt me much grandmother and i've thought of a good thing for to-morrow i shall never be hurt again if you will only be so good as to give me the old handle of the broken crutch grandmother and the block of wood that lies in the chimney- corner and that is of no use i'll make it of some use if i may have it take it then dear said the old woman and you'll find the handle of the broken crutch under my bed paul went to work immediately and fastened one end of the pole into the block of wood so as to make something like a dry-rubbing brush look grandmamma look at my scotcher i call this thing my scotcher said paul because i shall always scotch the wheels with it i shall never pinch my fingers again my hands you see will be safe at the end of this long stick and sister anne you need not be at the trouble of carrying any more stones after me up the hill we shall never want stones any more my scotcher will do without anything else i hope i wish it was morning and that a carriage would come that i might run up the hill and try my scotcher and i wish that as many chaises may go by to-morrow as there did to-day and that we may bring you as many halfpence grandmother said the little girl so do i my dear anne said the old woman for i mean that you and your brother shall have all the money that you get to-morrow you may buy some gingerbread for yourselves or some of those ripe plums that you saw at the fruit-stall the other day which is just going into dunstable i told you then that i could not afford to buy such things for you but now that you can earn halfpence for yourselves children it is fair should taste a ripe plum and bit of gingerbread for once and a way in your lives we'll bring some of the gingerbread home to her shan't we brother whispered little anne the morning came but no carriages were heard though paul and his sister had risen at five o'clock that they might be sure to be ready for early travellers paul kept his scotcher poised upon his shoulder and watched eagerly at his station at the bottom of the hill he did not wait long before a carriage came he followed it up the hill and the instant the postillion called to him and bid him stop the wheels he put his scotcher behind them and found that it answered the purpose perfectly well many carriages went by this day and paul and anne received a great many halfpence from the travellers when it grew dusk in the evening anne said to her brother -- i don't think any more carriages will come by to-day let us count the halfpence and carry them home now to grandmother no not yet answered paul let them alone -- let them lie still in the hole where i have put them i daresay more carriages will come by before it is quite dark and then we shall have more halfpence paul had taken the halfpence out of his hat and he had put them into a hole in the high bank by the roadside and anne said she would not meddle with them and that she would wait till her brother liked to count them and paul said -- if you will stay and watch here i will go and gather some blackberries for you in the hedge in yonder field stand you hereabouts half-way up the hill and the moment you see any carriage coming along the road run as fast as you can and call me anne waited a long time or what she thought a long time and she saw no carriage and she trailed her brother's scotcher up and down till she was tired then she stood still and looked again and she saw no carriage so she went sorrowfully into the field and to the hedge where her brother was gathering blackberries and she said paul i'm sadly tired sadly tired said she and my eyes are quite strained with looking for chaises no more chaises will come to-night and your scotcher is lying there of no use upon the ground have not i waited long enough for to- day paul oh no said paul here are some blackberries for you you had better wait a little bit longer perhaps a carriage might go by whilst you are standing here talking to me anne who was of a very obliging temper and who liked to do what she was asked to do went back to the place where the scotcher lay and scarcely had she reached the spot when she heard the noise of a carriage she ran to call her brother and to their great joy they now saw four chaises coming towards them paul as soon as they went up the hill followed with his scotcher first he scotched the wheels of one carriage then of another and anne was so much delighted with observing how well the scotcher stopped the wheels and how much better it was than stones that she forgot to go and hold her brother's hat to the travellers for halfpence till she was roused by the voice of a little rosy girl who was looking out of the window of one of the chaises come close to the chaise-door said the little girl here are some halfpence for you anne held the hat and she afterwards went on to the other carriages money was thrown to her from each of them and when they had all gotten safely to the top of the hill she and her brother sat down upon a large stone by the roadside to count their treasure first they began by counting what was in the hat -- one two three four halfpence but oh brother look at this exclaimed anne this is not the same as the other halfpence no indeed it is not cried paul it is no halfpenny it is a guinea a bright golden guinea is it said anne who had never seen a guinea in her life before and who did not know its value and will it do as well as a halfpenny to buy gingerbread i'll run to the fruit-stall and ask the woman shall i no no said paul you need not ask any woman or anybody but me i can tell you all about it as well as anybody in the whole world the whole world oh paul you forgot not so well as my grandmother why not so well as my grandmother perhaps but anne i can tell you that you must not talk yourself anne but you must listen to me quietly or else you won't understand what i am going to tell you for i can assure you that i don't think i quite understood it myself anne the first time my grandmother told it to me though i stood stock still listening my best prepared by this speech to hear something very difficult to be understood anne looked very grave and her brother explained to her that with a guinea she might buy two hundred and fifty-two times as many plums as she could get for a penny why paul you know the fruit-woman said she would give us a dozen plums for a penny now for this little guinea would she give us two hundred and fifty-two dozen if she has so many and if we like to have so many to be sure she will said paul but i think we should not like to have two hundred and fifty-two dozen of plums we could not eat such a number but we could give some of them to my grandmother said anne but still there would be too many for her and for us too said paul and when we had eaten the plums there would be an end to all the pleasure but now i'll tell you what i am thinking of anne that we might buy something for my grandmother that would be very useful to her indeed with the guinea -- something that would last a great while what brother what sort of thing something that she said she wanted very much last winter when she was so ill with the rheumatism -- something that she said yesterday when you were making her bed she wished she might be able to buy before next winter i know i know what you mean said anne -- a blanket oh yes paul that will be much better than plums do let us buy a blanket for her how glad she will be to see it i will make her bed with the new blanket and then bring her to see it but paul how shall we buy a blanket where are blankets to be got leave that to me i'll manage that i know where blankets can be got i saw one hanging out of a shop the day i went last to dunstable you have seen a great many things at dunstable brother yes a great many but i never saw anything there or anywhere else that i wished for half so much as i did for the blanket for my grandmother do you remember how she used to shiver with the cold last winter i'll buy the blanket to-morrow i'm going to dunstable with her spinning and you'll bring the blanket to me and i shall make the bed very neatly that will be all right -- all happy said anne clapping her hands but stay hush don't clap your hands so anne it will not be all happy i'm afraid said paul and his countenance changed and he looked very grave it will not be all right i'm afraid for there is one thing we have neither of us thought of but that we ought to think about we cannot buy the blanket i'm afraid why paul why because i don't think this guinea is honestly ours nay brother but i'm sure it is honestly ours it was given to us and grandmother said all that was given to us to-day was to be our own but who gave it to you anne some of the people in those chaises paul i don't know which of them but i daresay it was the little rosy girl no said paul for when she called you to the chaise door she said 'here's some halfpence for you ' now if she gave you the guinea she must have given it to you by mistake well but perhaps some of the people in the other chaises gave it to me and did not give it to me by mistake paul there was a gentleman reading in one of the chaises and a lady who looked very good-naturedly at me and then the gentleman put down his book and put his head out of the window and looked at your scotcher brother and he asked me if that was your own making and when i said yes and that i was your sister he smiled at me and put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and threw a handful of halfpence into the hat and i daresay he gave us the guinea along with them because he liked your scotcher so much why said paul that might be to be sure but i wish i was quite certain of it then as we are not quite certain had not we best go and ask my grandmother what she thinks about it paul thought this was excellent advice and he was not a silly boy who did not like to follow good advice he went with his sister directly to his grandmother showed her the guinea and told her how they came by it my dear honest children said she i am very glad you told me all this i am very glad that you did not buy either the plums or the blanket with this guinea i'm sure it is not honestly ours those who threw it you gave it you by mistake i warrant and what i would have you do is to go to dunstable and try if you can at either of the inns find out the person who gave it to you it is now so late in the evening that perhaps the travellers will sleep at dunstable instead of going on the next stage and it is likely that whosoever gave you a guinea instead of a halfpenny has found out their mistake by this time all you can do is to go and inquire for the gentleman who was reading in the chaise oh interrupted paul i know a good way of finding him out i remember it was a dark green chaise with red wheels and i remember i read the innkeeper's name upon the chaise 'john nelson ' i am much obliged to you for teaching me to read grandmother you told me yesterday grandmother that the names written upon chaises are the innkeepers to whom they belong i read the name of the innkeeper upon that chaise it was john nelson so anne and i will go to both the inns in dunstable and try to find out this chaise -- john nelson's come anne let us set out before it gets quite dark anne and her brother passed with great courage the tempting stall that was covered with gingerbread and ripe plums and pursued their way steadily through the streets of dunstable but paul when he came to the shop where he had seen the blanket stopped for a moment and said it is a great pity anne that the guinea is not ours however we are doing what is honest and that is a comfort here we must go through this gateway into the inn-yard we are come to the 'dun cow ' cow said anne i see no cow look up and you'll see the cow over your head said paul -- the sign -- the picture come never mind looking at it now i want to find out the green chaise that has john nelson's name upon it paul pushed forward through a crowded passage till he got into the inn- yard there was a great noise and bustle the hostlers were carrying in luggage the postillions were rubbing down the horses or rolling the chaises into the coach-house what now what business have you here pray said a waiter who almost ran over paul as he was crossing the yard in a great hurry to get some empty bottles from the bottle-rack you've no business here crowding up the yard walk off young gentleman if you please pray give me leave sir said paul to stay a few minutes to look amongst these chaises for one dark green chaise with red wheels that has mr john nelson's name written upon it what's that he says about a dark green chaise said one of the postillions what should such a one as he is know about chaises interrupted the hasty waiter and he vas going to turn paul out of the yard but the hostler caught hold of his arm and said maybe the child has some business here let's know what he has to say for himself the waiter was at this instant luckily obliged to leave them to attend the bell and paul told his business to the hostler who as soon as he saw the guinea and heard the story shook paul by the hand and said stand steady my honest lad i'll find the chaise for you if it is to be found here but john nelson's chaises almost always drive to the 'black bull ' after some difficulty the green chaise with john nelson's name upon it and the postillion who drove that chaise were found and the postillion told paul that he was just going into the parlour to the gentleman he had driven to be paid and that he would carry the guinea with him no said paul we should like to give it back ourselves yes said the hostler that they have a right to do the postillion made no reply but looked vexed and went towards the house desiring the children would wait in the passage till his return in the passage there was standing a decent clean good natured looking woman with two huge straw baskets on each side of her one of the baskets stood a little in the way of the entrance a man who was pushing his way in and carried in his hand a string of dead larks hung to a pole impatient at being stopped kicked down the straw basket and all its contents were thrown out bright straw hats and boxes and slippers were all thrown in disorder upon the dirty ground oh they will be trampled upon they will be all spoiled exclaimed the woman to whom they belonged we'll help you to pick them up if you will let us cried paul and anne and they immediately ran to her assistance when the things were all safe in the basket again the children expressed a desire to know how such beautiful things could be made of straw but the woman had not time to answer before the postillion came out of the parlour and with him a gentleman's servant who came to paul and clapping him upon the back said so my little chap i gave you a guinea for a halfpenny i hear and i understand you've brought it back again that's right give me hold of it no brother said anne this is not the gentleman that was reading pooh child i came in mr nelson's green chaise here's the postillion can tell you so i and my master came in that chaise i and my master that was reading as you say and it was he that threw the money out to you he is going to bed he is tired and can't see you himself he desires that you'll give me the guinea he pushed them towards the door but the basket-woman whispered to them as they went out wait in the street till i come to you pray mrs landlady cried this gentleman's servant addressing himself to the landlady who just then came out of a room where some company were at supper pray mrs landlady please to let me have roasted larks for my supper you are famous for larks at dunstable and i make it a rule to taste the best of everything wherever i go and waiter let me have a bottle of claret do you hear larks and claret for his supper said the basket-woman to herself as she looked at him from head to foot the postillion was still waiting as if to speak to him and she observed them afterwards whispering and laughing together no bad hit was a sentence which the servant pronounced several times now it occurred to the basket-woman that this man had cheated the children out of the guinea to pay for the larks and claret and she thought that perhaps she could discover the truth she waited quietly in the passage waiter joe joe cried the landlady why don't you carry in the sweetmeat-puffs and the tarts here to the company in the best parlour coming ma'am answered the waiter and with a large dish of tarts and puffs the waiter came from the bar the landlady threw open the door of the best parlour to let him in and the basket-woman had now a full view of a large cheerful company and amongst them several children sitting round a supper-table ay whispered the landlady as the door closed after the waiter and the tarts there are customers enough i warrant for you in that room if you had but the luck to be called in pray what would you have the conscience i wonder now to charge me for these here half-dozen little mats to put under my dishes a trifle ma'am said the basket-woman she let the landlady have the mats cheap and the landlady then declared she would step in and see if the company in the best parlour had done supper when they come to their wine added she i'll speak a good word for you and get you called in afore the children are sent to bed the landlady after the usual speech of i hope the supper and everything is to your liking ladies and gentlemen began with if any of the young gentlemen or ladies would have a cur'osity to see any of our famous dunstable straw-work there's a decent body without would i daresay be proud to show them her pincushion-boxes and her baskets and slippers and her other cur'osities the eyes of the children all turned towards their mother their mother smiled and immediately their father called in the basket-woman and desired her to produce her curiosities the children gathered round her large pannier as it opened but they did not touch any of her things ah papa cried a little rosy girl here are a pair of straw slippers that would just fit you i think but would not straw shoes wear out very soon and would not they let in the wet yes my dear said her father but these slippers are meant -- for powdering-slippers miss interrupted the basket-woman to wear when people are powdering their hair continued the gentleman that they may not spoil their other shoes and will you buy them papa no i cannot indulge myself said her father in buying them now i must make amends said he laughing for my carelessness and as i threw away a guinea to-day i must endeavour to save sixpence at least ah the guinea that you threw by mistake into the little girl's hat as we were coming up chalk hill mamma i wonder that the little girl did not take notice of its being a guinea and that she did not run after the chaise to give it back again i should think if she had been an honest girl she would have returned it miss -- ma'am -- sir said the basket-woman if it would not be impertinent may i speak a word a little boy and girl have just been here inquiring for a gentleman who gave them a guinea instead of a halfpenny by mistake and not five minutes ago i saw the boy give the guinea to a gentleman's servant who is there without and who said his master desired it should be returned to him there must be some mistake or some trick in this said the gentleman are the children gone i must see them -- send after them i'll go for them myself said the good natured basket-woman i bid them wait in the street yonder for my mind misgave me that the man who spoke so short to them was a cheat with his larks and his claret paul and anne were speedily summoned and brought back by their friend the basket-woman and anne the moment she saw the gentleman knew that he was the very person who smiled upon her who admired her brother's scotcher and who threw a handful of halfpence into the hat but she could not be certain she said that she received the guinea from him she only thought it most likely that she did but i can be certain whether the guinea you returned be mine or no said the gentleman i marked the guinea it was a light one the only guinea i had which i put into my waistcoat pocket this morning he rang the bell and desired the waiter to let the gentleman who was in the room opposite to him know that he wished to see him the gentleman in the white parlour sir do you mean i mean the master of the servant who received a guinea from this child he is a mr pembroke sir said the waiter mr pembroke came and as soon as he heard what had happened he desired the waiter to show him to the room where his servant was at supper the dishonest servant who was supping upon larks and claret knew nothing of what was going on but his knife and fork dropped from his hand and he overturned a bumper of claret as he started up from the table in great surprise and terror when his master came in with a face of indignation and demanded the guinea -- the guinea sir that you got from this child that guinea which you said i ordered you to ask for from this child the servant confounded and half intoxicated could only stammer out that he had more guineas than one about him and that he really did not know which it was he pulled his money out and spread it upon the table with trembling hands the marked guinea appeared his master instantly turned him out of his service with strong expressions of contempt and now my little honest girl said the gentleman who had admired her brother's scotcher turning to anne and now tell me who you are and what you and your brother want or wish for most in the world in the same moment anne and paul exclaimed the thing we wish for the most in the world is a blanket for our grandmother she is not our grandmother in reality i believe sir said paul but she is just as good to us and taught me to read and taught anne to knit and taught us both that we should be honest -- so she has and i wish she had a new blanket before next winter to keep her from the cold and the rheumatism she had the rheumatism sadly last winter sir and there is a blanket in this street that would be just the thing for her she shall have it then and continued the gentleman i will do something more for you do you like to be employed or to be idle best we like to have something to do always if we could sir said paul but we are forced to
