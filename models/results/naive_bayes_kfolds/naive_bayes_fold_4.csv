emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her,1,1,0.953171014662616
the event had every promise of happiness for her friend mr weston was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match but it was a black morning's work for her the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day she recalled her past kindness -- the kindness the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabella's marriage on their being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed intelligent well-informed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault,1,1,0.9971557308564751
poor miss taylor -- i wish she were here again what a pity it is that mr weston ever thought of her,1,1,0.9786756999655624
i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot mr weston is such a good-humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wife -- and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own,1,1,0.9736945166687138
they are to be put into mr weston's stable papa you know we have settled all that already we talked it all over with mr weston last night and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughter's being housemaid there i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her -- james is so obliged to you,1,1,0.9572592282129682
mr knightley a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly connected with it as the elder brother of isabella's husband he lived about a mile from highbury was a frequent visitor and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london he had returned to a late dinner after some days' absence and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square it was a happy circumstance and animated mr woodhouse for some time mr knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good and his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were answered most satisfactorily when this was over mr woodhouse gratefully observed it is very kind of you mr knightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk,1,1,0.9968519146109591
but you must have found it very damp and dirty i wish you may not catch cold,1,1,0.5526211914456157
poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say poor miss taylor ' i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence -- at any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two,1,1,0.9743348490728081
my dearest papa you do not think i could mean you or suppose mr knightley to mean you what a horrible idea oh no i meant only myself mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know -- in a joke -- it is all a joke we always say what we like to one another,1,1,0.7897378298919687
mr knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body,1,1,0.9952440853221336
emma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion said mr knightley we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor's advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor's time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married,1,1,0.9972197058487503
i promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed for other people it is the greatest amusement in the world and after such success you know -- every body said that mr weston would never marry again oh dear no mr weston who had been a widower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful -- mr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not letting him all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none of it,1,1,0.9891487149312596
a straightforward open-hearted man like weston and a rational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference,1,1,0.9369433058171357
emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others rejoined mr woodhouse understanding but in part but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up one's family circle grievously,1,1,0.9187616872637536
mr weston was a native of highbury and born of a respectable family which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property he had received a good education but on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied,1,1,0.9115192583287753
captain weston was a general favourite and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill of a great yorkshire family and miss churchill fell in love with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend,1,1,0.9797891392891747
he had only himself to please in his choice his fortune was his own for as to frank it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle's heir it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age it was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his father's assistance his father had no apprehension of it the aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely but it was not in mr weston's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed so deservedly dear he saw his son every year in london and was proud of him and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern,1,1,0.9781954953591776
such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could with thorough self-approbation recommend though he might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to say,1,1,0.8325340528176695
oh yes -- that is no -- i do not know -- but i believe he has read a good deal -- but not what you would think any thing of he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window seats -- but he reads all them to himself but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can,1,1,0.653099566617042
that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without having any idea of his name a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do a degree or two lower and a creditable appearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other but a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every other he is below it,1,1,0.7517487019726958
to be sure oh yes it is not likely you should ever have observed him but he knows you very well indeed -- i mean by sight,1,1,0.7932985597852704
six years hence dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old,1,1,0.8039235335767472
to be sure so it is but they live very comfortably they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year,1,1,0.8598521784588133
they met mr martin the very next day as they were walking on the donwell road he was on foot and after looking very respectfully at her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey and walking a few yards forward while they talked together soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr robert martin his appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible young man but his person had no other advantage and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harriet's inclination harriet was not insensible of manner she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder mr martin looked as if he did not know what manner was,1,1,0.989679149457306
he is very plain undoubtedly -- remarkably plain -- but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility i had no right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility,1,1,0.8963387659925062
to be sure said harriet in a mortified voice he is not so genteel as real gentlemen,1,1,0.7605681795701683
certainly he is not like mr knightley he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr knightley i see the difference plain enough but mr knightley is so very fine a man,1,1,0.9346184249397411
i do not know what your opinion may be mrs weston said mr knightley of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith but i think it a bad thing,1,1,0.9984749684023775
emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old i have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule the list she drew up when only fourteen -- i remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding where miss taylor failed to stimulate i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothing -- you never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished -- you know you could not,1,1,0.9755975348737829
i have not a fault to find with her person he replied i think her all you describe i love to look at her and i will add this praise that i do not think her personally vain considering how very handsome she is she appears to be little occupied with it her vanity lies another way mrs weston i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread of its doing them both harm,1,1,0.9878527170378419
and i mr knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm with all dear emma's little faults she is an excellent creature where shall we see a better daughter or a kinder sister or a truer friend no no she has qualities which may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong she will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the right a hundred times,1,1,0.946245708184193
very well i will not plague you any more emma shall be an angel and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection and isabella always thinks as he does except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children i am sure of having their opinions with me,1,1,0.9709600932336939
you have given miss smith all that she required said he you have made her graceful and easy she was a beautiful creature when she came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature,1,1,0.9635101394189135
i am glad you think i have been useful to her but harriet only wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself i have done very little,1,1,0.9508547939947936
if it were admissible to contradict a lady said the gallant mr elton --,1,1,0.8422179384169041
did you ever have your likeness taken harriet said she did you ever sit for your picture,1,1,0.8212669008879242
let me entreat you cried mr elton it would indeed be a delight let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend i know what your drawings are how could you suppose me ignorant is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room at randalls,1,1,0.9547367197737552
there was merit in every drawing -- in the least finished perhaps the most her style was spirited but had there been much less or had there been ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same they were both in ecstasies a likeness pleases every body and miss woodhouse's performances must be capital,1,1,0.9509734636954355
no great variety of faces for you said emma i had only my own family to study from there is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous that i could only take him by stealth neither of them very like therefore mrs weston again and again and again you see dear mrs weston always my kindest friend on every occasion she would sit whenever i asked her there is my sister and really quite her own little elegant figure -- and the face not unlike i should have made a good likeness of her if she would have sat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet then here come all my attempts at three of those four children -- there they are henry and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other and any one of them might do for any one of the rest she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the air and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any of mama's children ever were here is my sketch of the fourth who was a baby i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see he had nestled down his head most conveniently that's very like i am rather proud of little george the corner of the sofa is very good then here is my last -- unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size whole-length -- my last and my best -- my brother mr john knightley -- this did not want much of being finished when i put it away in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness i could not help being provoked for after all my pains and when i had really made a very good likeness of it -- mrs weston and i were quite agreed in thinking it very like -- only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side -- after all this came poor dear isabella's cold approbation of -- yes it was a little like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all it was made a great favour of and altogether it was more than i could bear and so i never would finish it to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in brunswick square -- and as i said i did then forswear ever drawing any body again but for harriet's sake or rather for my own and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present i will break my resolution now,1,1,0.9813883395474133
the sitting began and harriet smiling and blushing and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist but there was no doing any thing with mr elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch she gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence but was really obliged to put an end to it and request him to place himself elsewhere it then occurred to her to employ him in reading,1,1,0.8183789908080683
if he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kindness indeed it would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen the irksomeness of miss smith's,1,1,0.9627366857241483
mr elton was only too happy harriet listened and emma drew in peace she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil to jump up and see the progress and be charmed -- there was no being displeased with such an encourager for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible she could not respect his eye but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable,1,1,0.9754328365642909
do you think so replied he i cannot agree with you it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature i never saw such a likeness in my life we must allow for the effect of shade you know,1,1,0.7207275693994843
but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear,1,0,0.42825706995085827
will you read the letter cried harriet pray do i'd rather you would,1,1,0.840467762437446
you could not have visited me she cried looking aghast no to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before that would have been too dreadful -- what an escape -- dear miss woodhouse i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world,1,1,0.9567621236582045
dear affectionate creature -- you banished to abbey-mill farm -- you confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it he must have a pretty good opinion of himself,1,1,0.8843589275412599
this letter however was written and sealed and sent the business was finished and harriet safe she was rather low all the evening but emma could allow for her amiable regrets and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr elton,1,1,0.9886882606577716
nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey-mill,1,1,0.9640921646947443
and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy but at hartfield,1,1,0.8694476798382719
harriet blushed and smiled and said something about wondering that people should like her so much the idea of mr elton was certainly cheering but still after a time she was tender-hearted again towards the rejected mr martin,1,1,0.9578207492254149
now he has got my letter said she softly i wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy they will be unhappy too i hope he will not mind it so very much,1,1,0.6974047187509732
harriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger,1,1,0.7533420480369687
i would ask for the pleasure of your company mr knightley but i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey,1,1,0.8891576371145273
thank you sir thank you i am going this moment myself and i think the sooner you go the better i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you,1,0,0.35877279205866897
mr woodhouse at last was off but mr knightley instead of being immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined for more chat he began speaking of harriet and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before,1,1,0.9843244898639626
almost every moment she has been gone longer already than she intended,1,1,0.8588889335984233
harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would,1,1,0.8850504067665078
i have reason to think he replied that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable quarter -- robert martin is the man her visit to abbey-mill this summer seems to have done his business he is desperately in love and means to marry her,1,1,0.9874815564978017
you saw her answer -- you wrote her answer too emma this is your doing you persuaded her to refuse him,1,1,0.8654175207078395
a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable intelligent gentleman-farmer,1,1,0.728545909104987
you are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before are unjust to harriet harriet's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them she is not a clever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and good-natured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice her good-nature too is not so very slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased with other people i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims a woman could possess,1,1,0.988763823227465
upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too better be without sense than misapply it as you do,1,1,0.7831994754226453
robert martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so and i hope it will not be long before he does your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of match-making it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have -- and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain,1,1,0.9488336878954724
good morning to you -- said he rising and walking off abruptly he was very much vexed he felt the disappointment of the young man and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the sanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly,1,1,0.9187175377856704
mr knightley might quarrel with her but emma could not quarrel with herself he was so much displeased that it was longer than usual before he came to hartfield again and when they did meet his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven she was sorry but could not repent on the contrary her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days,1,1,0.9782776619843311
her views of improving her little friend's mind by a great deal of useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than a few first chapters and the intention of going on to-morrow it was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at harriet's fortune than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper made up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies,1,1,0.9345244963124657
it was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of highbury in general should be put under requisition mr elton was the only one whose assistance she asked he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas charades or conundrums that he might recollect and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections and at the same time as she could perceive most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled and rather sentimentally recited that well-known charade,1,1,0.9472062155422372
i do not offer it for miss smith's collection said he being my friend's i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it,1,1,0.8482831703590217
but harriet was in a tremor and could not touch it and emma never loth to be first was obliged to examine it herself,1,1,0.9103413620183978
another view of man my second brings behold him there the monarch of the seas,1,0,0.17517544354444267
that is ship -- plain as it can be -- now for the cream,1,0,0.16347395321007552
a very proper compliment -- and then follows the application which i think my dear harriet you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending read it in comfort to yourself there can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you,1,1,0.9171550956693111
i cannot make a question or listen to a question about that it is a certainty receive it on my judgment it is a sort of prologue to the play a motto to the chapter and will be soon followed by matter-of-fact prose,1,0,0.4679078704087045
this is an alliance which whoever -- whatever your friends may be must be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools if they are anxious to see you happily married here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it -- if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only object is that you should in the common phrase be well married here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment the rise in the world which must satisfy them,1,1,0.9233022428573987
it is one thing said she presently -- her cheeks in a glow -- to have very good sense in a common way like every body else and if there is any thing to say to sit down and write a letter and say just what you must in a short way and another to write verses and charades like this,1,1,0.6860805962025374
oh miss woodhouse what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book i am sure i have not got one half so good,1,1,0.8681672149102315
-- the best of all granted -- for private enjoyment and for private enjoyment keep them they are not at all the less written you know because you divide them the couplet does not cease to be nor does its meaning change but take it away and all appropriation ceases and a very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection depend upon it he would not like to have his charade slighted much better than his passion a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or neither give me the book i will write it down and then there can be no possible reflection on you,1,1,0.794806868847035
yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh a piece of paper was found on the table this morning -- dropt we suppose by a fairy -- containing a very pretty charade and we have just copied it in,1,1,0.6335917073903433
ah it is no difficulty to see who you take after your dear mother was so clever at all those things if i had but her memory but i can remember nothing -- not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention i can only recollect the first stanza and there are several,1,1,0.7945342718081162
yes papa it is written out in our second page we copied it from the elegant extracts it was garrick's you know,1,1,0.6044639780284768
it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer -- but it seems a case of necessity mr john knightley must be in town again on the 28th and we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey mr knightley promises to give up his claim this christmas -- though you know it is longer since they were with him than with us,1,1,0.9651443800359462
it would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield,1,1,0.9311766257257301
henry is a fine boy but john is very like his mama henry is the eldest he was named after me not after his father john the second is named after his father some people are surprized i believe that the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry which i thought very pretty of her and he is a very clever boy indeed they are all remarkably clever and they have so many pretty ways they will come and stand by my chair and say grandpapa can you give me a bit of string ' and once henry asked me for a knife but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas i think their father is too rough with them very often,1,1,0.851191985337424
i have no hesitation in saying replied mr elton though hesitating a good deal while he spoke i have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as i do -- i have not the smallest doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as i see it looking at the book again and replacing it on the table he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life,1,1,0.8689174026006654
after this speech he was gone as soon as possible emma could not think it too soon for with all his good and agreeable qualities there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh she ran away to indulge the inclination leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriet's share,1,1,0.9287980542281608
though now the middle of december there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise and on the morrow emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family who lived a little way out of highbury,1,1,0.9618839195808685
harriet could just answer oh dear yes before the gentleman joined them the wants and sufferings of the poor family however were the first subject on meeting he had been going to call on them his visit he would now defer but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done mr elton then turned back to accompany them,1,1,0.9701633530756558
mr elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at his friend cole's and that she was come in herself for the stilton cheese the north wiltshire the butter the cellery the beet-root and all the dessert,1,1,0.9199531047025845
mr elton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied and looking forwards behind it was another with which it immediately communicated the door between them was open and emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it but she fully intended that mr elton should close it it was not closed however it still remained ajar but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself it could be protracted no longer she was then obliged to be finished and make her appearance,1,1,0.9933933364124359
the lovers were standing together at one of the windows it had a most favourable aspect and for half a minute emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully but it would not do he had not come to the point he had been most agreeable most delightful he had told harriet that he had seen them go by and had purposely followed them other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt but nothing serious,1,1,0.8753597195352643
cautious very cautious thought emma he advances inch by inch and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure,1,1,0.5175669253307575
just as it should be said mr john knightley and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emma's account i hope you will be satisfied,1,1,0.9904223541709228
it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa -- you quite forget poor mr weston,1,1,0.9734260489928114
to be sure -- our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong,1,1,0.6295656074731714
a material difference then she replied -- and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer,1,1,0.764496218430364
ah -- indeed i am very sorry -- come shake hands with me,1,0,0.4681548251665658
come come cried emma feeling this to be an unsafe subject i must beg you not to talk of the sea it makes me envious and miserable -- i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you,1,1,0.8332427883508943
i hope he will be here to-morrow for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence and my dear whenever he comes you had better let him look at little bella's throat,1,1,0.6000409127714179
that has been a good deal the case my dear but not to the degree you mention perry says that colds have been very general but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november perry does not call it altogether a sickly season,1,1,0.9366780599589737
no i do not know that mr wingfield considers it very sickly except --,1,1,0.7205743688778022
i am sorry to hear you say so sir but i assure you excepting those little nervous head-aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere i am quite well myself and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were a little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of coming i hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow for i assure you mr wingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether in such good case i trust at least that you do not think mr knightley looking ill turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband,1,1,0.9521756292566156
what is the matter sir -- did you speak to me cried mr john knightley hearing his own name,1,1,0.9015046501230701
i am most happy to hear it -- but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior -- and exactly emma's age,1,1,0.9835833586541401
i know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quite a mistake sir -- we all had our health perfectly well there never found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy and i am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly,1,1,0.875257366835894
you should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere -- perry was a week at cromer once and he holds it to be the best of all the sea-bathing places a fine open sea he says and very pure air and by what i understand you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable you should have consulted perry,1,1,0.6224625291139207
mr perry said he in a voice of very strong displeasure would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for why does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i do -- at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another -- i may be allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perry -- i want his directions no more than his drugs he paused -- and growing cooler in a moment added with only sarcastic dryness if mr perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself,1,1,0.9150929855009722
in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings but one complete dinner engagement and out of the house too there was no avoiding though at christmas mr weston would take no denial they must all dine at randalls one day -- even mr woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party,1,1,0.9904132297688815
i thank you but i assure you you are quite mistaken mr elton and i are very good friends and nothing more and she walked on amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant and in want of counsel he said no more,1,1,0.9533359689272493
his face lengthened immediately and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered,1,0,0.28510047174300723
oh no -- i am grieved to find -- i was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs goddard's door which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress i was told that miss smith was not better by no means better rather worse very much grieved and concerned -- i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning,1,1,0.9846556871202538
dreadful -- exactly so indeed -- she will be missed every moment,1,1,0.7940906184460214
christmas weather observed mr elton quite seasonable and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday and prevent this day's party which it might very possibly have done for mr woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground but now it is of no consequence this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings at christmas every body invites their friends about them and people think little of even the worst weather i was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week nothing could be pleasanter i went for only one night and could not get away till that very day se'nnight,1,1,0.9657593844611083
mr john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure but said only coolly,1,1,0.9543341765321456
i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls,1,1,0.8938457226824561
indeed in a tone of wonder and pity i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery well sir the time must come when you will be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great enjoyment,1,1,0.7236028506775275
emma liked the subject so well that she began upon it to mrs weston very soon after their moving into the drawing-room wishing her joy -- yet observing that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming -- mrs weston agreed to it but added that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of for i cannot depend upon his coming i cannot be so sanguine as mr weston i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing mr weston i dare say has been telling you exactly how the matter stands,1,1,0.9961684211035973
my emma replied mrs weston smiling what is the certainty of caprice then turning to isabella who had not been attending before -- you must know my dear mrs knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks it depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper to you -- to my two daughters -- i may venture on the truth mrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very odd-tempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him,1,1,0.9976567358096157
and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain i am sorry for it the introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better,1,1,0.8752331665281307
i admired your resolution very much sir said he in venturing out in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow very soon every body must have seen the snow coming on i admired your spirit and i dare say we shall get home very well another hour or two's snow can hardly make the road impassable and we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight,1,1,0.6090119710371746
you had better order the carriage directly my love said she i dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk i am not at all afraid i should not mind walking half the way i could change my shoes you know the moment i got home and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold,1,1,0.6332854140060045
indeed replied he then my dear isabella it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing does give you cold walk home -- you are prettily shod for walking home i dare say it will be bad enough for the horses,1,1,0.8327472368938047
the carriage came and mr woodhouse always the first object on such occasions was carefully attended to his own by mr knightley and mr weston but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for he was afraid they should have a very bad drive he was afraid poor isabella would not like it and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind he did not know what they had best do they must keep as much together as they could and james was talked to and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage,1,1,0.9817770548267095
encouragement -- i give you encouragement -- sir you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend in no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance i am exceedingly sorry but it is well that the mistake ends where it does had the same behaviour continued miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views not being aware probably any more than myself of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of but as it is the disappointment is single and i trust will not be lasting i have no thoughts of matrimony at present,1,1,0.9770017131852194
how she could have been so deceived -- he protested that he had never thought seriously of harriet -- never she looked back as well as she could but it was all confusion she had taken up the idea she supposed and made every thing bend to it his manners however must have been unmarked wavering dubious or she could not have been so misled,1,1,0.9226307012883406
but -- that he should talk of encouragement should consider her as aware of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short to marry him -- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind -- look down upon her friend so well understanding the gradations of rank below him and be so blind to what rose above as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her -- it was most provoking,1,1,0.9258166122406307
she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark she had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman's return she went to mrs goddard's accordingly the very next day to undergo the necessary penance of communication and a severe one it was -- she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred -- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject all her observations all her convictions all her prophecies for the last six weeks,1,1,0.9868808312481799
it was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and ignorant but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet and repressing imagination all the rest of her life her second duty now inferior only to her father's claims was to promote harriet's comfort and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match-making she got her to hartfield and shewed her the most unvarying kindness striving to occupy and amuse her and by books and conversation to drive mr elton from her thoughts,1,1,0.9899920994986886
harriet did think him all perfection and maintained the non-existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness -- and did in truth prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen but yet it appeared to her so natural so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force,1,1,0.9327871475084257
harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at mrs goddard's mr elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school and it must be at hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth where the wound had been given there must the cure be found if anywhere and emma felt that till she saw her in the way of cure there could be no true peace for herself,1,1,0.9833604040953398
that's easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your own master you are the worst judge in the world mr knightley of the difficulties of dependence you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage,1,1,0.774153177779458
no said emma laughing but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again such language for a young man entirely dependent to use -- nobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own mr frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for him -- standing up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as loud as he could -- how can you imagine such conduct practicable,1,1,0.9788631100346188
i will say no more about him cried emma you turn every thing to evil we are both prejudiced you against i for him and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here,1,1,0.6658220324519604
this she had been prepared for when she entered the house but meant having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses and misses of highbury and their card-parties she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr elton but he was actually hurried off by miss bates she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the coles to usher in a letter from her niece,1,1,0.9891928033244595
you are extremely kind replied miss bates highly gratified you who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself i am sure there is nobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouse's my mother does not hear she is a little deaf you know ma'am addressing her do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane's handwriting,1,1,0.9948178784552142
yes -- entirely her own doing entirely her own choice and colonel and mrs campbell think she does quite right just what they should recommend and indeed they particularly wish her to try her native air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately,1,1,0.9674297873499966
jane fairfax was an orphan the only child of mrs bates's youngest daughter,1,1,0.9776457767009369
but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny this was colonel campbell who had very highly regarded fairfax as an excellent officer and most deserving young man and farther had been indebted to him for such attentions during a severe camp-fever as he believed had saved his life these were claims which he did not learn to overlook though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax before his own return to england put any thing in his power when he did return he sought out the child and took notice of her he was a married man with only one living child a girl about jane's age and jane became their guest paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all and before she was nine years old his daughter's great fondness for her and his own wish of being a real friend united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education it was accepted and from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbell's family and had lived with them entirely only visiting her grandmother from time to time,1,1,0.9920200162903438
the affection of the whole family the warm attachment of miss campbell in particular was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of jane's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents they continued together with unabated regard however till the marriage of miss campbell who by that chance that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior engaged the affections of mr dixon a young man rich and agreeable almost as soon as they were acquainted and was eligibly and happily settled while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn,1,1,0.9967290289510737
this event had very lately taken place too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning she had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice and retire from all the pleasures of life of rational intercourse equal society peace and hope to penance and mortification for ever,1,1,0.9686104886991105
with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth though there might be some truths not told it was her own choice to give the time of their absence to highbury to spend perhaps her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear and the campbells whatever might be their motive or motives whether single or double or treble gave the arrangement their ready sanction and said that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air for the recovery of her health than on any thing else certain it was that she was to come and that highbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- mr frank churchill -- must put up for the present with jane fairfax who could bring only the freshness of a two years' absence,1,1,0.9933058319722479
in short she sat during the first visit looking at jane fairfax with twofold complacency the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice and was determining that she would dislike her no longer when she took in her history indeed her situation as well as her beauty when she considered what all this elegance was destined to what she was going to sink from how she was going to live it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect especially if to every well-known particular entitling her to interest were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to mr dixon which she had so naturally started to herself in that case nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced mr dixon's actions from his wife or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first if it were love it might be simple single successless love on her side alone she might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison while a sharer of his conversation with her friend and from the best the purest of motives might now be denying herself this visit to ireland and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty,1,1,0.9964414972034931
a very pleasant evening he began as soon as mr woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary told that he understood and the papers swept away -- particularly pleasant you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music i do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting at one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma you left nothing undone i was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument at her grandmother's it must have been a real indulgence,1,1,0.9916500128624075
an arch look expressed -- i understand you well enough but she said only miss fairfax is reserved,1,1,0.9165728238890419
oh no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little information i obtained,1,1,0.7698735540701583
news oh yes i always like news what is it -- why do you smile so -- where did you hear it -- at randalls,1,1,0.686978514604531
no not at randalls i have not been near randalls when the door was thrown open and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room full of thanks and full of news miss bates knew not which to give quickest mr knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him,1,1,0.9915590217804443
oh my dear sir how are you this morning my dear miss woodhouse -- i come quite over-powered such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork you are too bountiful have you heard the news mr elton is going to be married,1,1,0.9614242581730496
jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her,1,1,0.7855615032253019
as to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been acquainted with her said emma nothing i suppose can be known one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance he has been gone only four weeks,1,1,0.9654619443947865
when i have seen mr elton replied jane i dare say i shall be interested -- but i believe it requires that with me and as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression may be a little worn off,1,1,0.9821906889273573
very odd but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand one takes up a notion and runs away with it mr dixon you say is not strictly speaking handsome,1,1,0.682098092141875
well my dear jane i believe we must be running away the weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy you are too obliging my dear miss woodhouse but we really must take leave this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed i shall just go round by mrs cole's but i shall not stop three minutes and jane you had better go home directly -- i would not have you out in a shower -- we think she is the better for highbury already thank you we do indeed i shall not attempt calling on mrs goddard for i really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork when we dress the leg it will be another thing good morning to you my dear sir oh mr knightley is coming too well that is so very -- i am sure if jane is tired you will be so kind as to give her your arm -- mr elton and miss hawkins -- good morning to you,1,1,0.996554231632697
the charming augusta hawkins in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit was in possession of an independent fortune of so many thousands as would always be called ten a point of some dignity as well as some convenience the story told well he had not thrown himself away -- he had gained a woman of 10 000 l or thereabouts and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity -- the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice the history which he had to give mrs cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps so quick from the accidental rencontre to the dinner at mr green's and the party at mrs brown's -- smiles and blushes rising in importance -- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- had in short to use a most intelligible phrase been so very ready to have him that vanity and prudence were equally contented,1,1,0.9688072038539762
during his present short stay emma had barely seen him but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension now spread over his air she was in fact beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings that except in a moral light as a penance a lesson a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again she wished him very well but he gave her pain and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction,1,1,0.9679071357351265
of the lady individually emma thought very little she was good enough for mr elton no doubt accomplished enough for highbury -- handsome enough -- to look plain probably by harriet's side as to connexion there emma was perfectly easy persuaded that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet he had done nothing on that article truth seemed attainable what she was must be uncertain but who she was might be found out and setting aside the 10 000 l it did not appear that she was at all harriet's superior she brought no name no blood no alliance miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristol -- merchant of course he must be called but as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath but bristol was her home the very heart of bristol for though the father and mother had died some years ago an uncle remained -- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him than that he was in the law line and with him the daughter had lived emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney and too stupid to rise and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister who was very well married to a gentleman in a great way near bristol who kept two carriages that was the wind-up of the history that was the glory of miss hawkins,1,1,0.9827120560362963
how that visit was to be acknowledged -- what would be necessary -- and what might be safest had been a point of some doubtful consideration absolute neglect of the mother and sisters when invited to come would be ingratitude it must not be and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance --,1,1,0.9453206315806689
she could think of nothing better and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve -- something of ingratitude merely glossed over -- it must be done or what would become of harriet,1,1,0.9142406303113105
she went however and when they reached the farm and she was to be put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led between espalier apple-trees to the front door the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before was beginning to revive a little local agitation and when they parted emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour she went on herself to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married and settled in donwell,1,1,0.9449364038732183
how d'ye do -- how d'ye do -- we have been sitting with your father -- glad to see him so well frank comes to-morrow -- i had a letter this morning -- we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty -- he is at oxford to-day and he comes for a whole fortnight i knew it would be so if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days i was always glad he did not come at christmas now we are going to have just the right weather for him fine dry settled weather we shall enjoy him completely every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish,1,1,0.8503175051159461
my dear dear anxious friend -- said she in mental soliloquy while walking downstairs from her own room always overcareful for every body's comfort but your own i see you now in all your little fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure that all is right the clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall 'tis twelve i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time to-morrow perhaps or a little later i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here i am sure they will bring him soon,1,1,0.8077586301899318
their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance on his side were the inquiries -- was she a horsewoman -- pleasant rides -- pleasant walks -- had they a large neighbourhood -- highbury perhaps afforded society enough -- there were several very pretty houses in and about it -- balls -- had they balls -- was it a musical society,1,1,0.9097510550539705
but when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance proportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity while their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing his mother-in-law and speaking of her with so much handsome praise so much warm admiration so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father and her very kind reception of himself as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please -- and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by mrs weston but undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter he understood what would be welcome he could be sure of little else his father's marriage he said had been the wisest measure every friend must rejoice in it and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him,1,1,0.9914426803497165
elegant agreeable manners i was prepared for said he but i confess that considering every thing i had not expected more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs weston,1,1,0.9841703868326435
emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other which had taken strong possession of her mind had ever crossed his and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence or proofs of defiance she must see more of him to understand his ways at present she only felt they were agreeable,1,1,0.9478066871990656
to be sure we do cried his father mrs bates -- we passed her house -- i saw miss bates at the window true true you are acquainted with miss fairfax i remember you knew her at weymouth and a fine girl she is call upon her by all means,1,1,0.9848289358194269
i have heard her speak of the acquaintance said emma she is a very elegant young woman,1,1,0.9730429939623446
mr frank churchill still declined it looking as serious as he could and his father gave his hearty support by calling out my good friend this is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it and as to mrs bates's he may get there from the crown in a hop step and jump,1,1,0.8557957211196653
they were permitted to go alone and with a cordial nod from one and a graceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day with full confidence in their comfort,1,1,0.9007679023942101
the next morning brought mr frank churchill again he came with mrs weston to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially he had been sitting with her it appeared most companionably at home till her usual hour of exercise and on being desired to chuse their walk immediately fixed on highbury -- he did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction but if left to him he should always chuse the same highbury that airy cheerful happy-looking highbury would be his constant attraction -- highbury with mrs weston stood for hartfield and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him they walked thither directly,1,1,0.9968019717326447
some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long and which had been the home of his father's father and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit they shewed altogether a good-will towards highbury in general which must be very like a merit to those he was with,1,1,0.9519403058895436
emma would not agree to this and began a warm defence of miss fairfax's complexion it was certainly never brilliant but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face he listened with all due deference acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same -- but yet he must confess that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health where features were indifferent a fine complexion gave beauty to them all and where they were good the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was,1,1,0.9721721631196113
oh yes gloves and every thing i do admire your patriotism you will be adored in highbury you were very popular before you came because you were mr weston's son -- but lay out half a guinea at ford's and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues,1,1,0.7197363405181995
so much the better -- or so much the worse -- i do not know which but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship or dulness of feeling -- there was one person i think who must have felt it miss fairfax herself she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction,1,1,0.9399850142182105
mrs weston laughed and said he did not know what he was talking about used only to a large house himself and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one but emma in her own mind determined that he did know what he was talking about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life and to marry from worthy motives he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper's room or a bad butler's pantry but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make him happy and that whenever he were attached he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment,1,1,0.9855997604873198
with the exception of this little blot emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him mrs weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether he appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one she could observe nothing wrong in his notions a great deal decidedly right he spoke of his uncle with warm regard was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself and though there was no being attached to the aunt he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect this was all very promising and but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him the honour if not of being really in love with her of being at least very near it and saved only by her own indifference -- for still her resolution held of never marrying -- the honour in short of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance,1,1,0.9952724556264915
although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings mr and mrs weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune something occurred while they were at hartfield to make emma want their advice and which was still more lucky she wanted exactly the advice they gave,1,1,0.9755546365579203
she owned that considering every thing she was not absolutely without inclination for the party the coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it -- so much consideration for her father they would have solicited the honour earlier but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from london which they hoped might keep mr woodhouse from any draught of air and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company upon the whole she was very persuadable and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly mrs goddard if not mrs bates might be depended on for bearing him company -- mr woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter's going out to dinner on a day now near at hand and spending the whole evening away from him as for his going emma did not wish him to think it possible the hours would be too late and the party too numerous he was soon pretty well resigned,1,1,0.9982135071450811
but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa,1,1,0.7994559647919748
but my dear sir cried mr weston if emma comes away early it will be breaking up the party,1,1,0.9254378135126172
i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly -- it depends upon the character of those who handle it mr knightley he is not a trifling silly young man if he were he would have done this differently he would either have gloried in the achievement or been ashamed of it there would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities -- no i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly,1,1,0.811817755179773
she followed another carriage to mr cole's door and was pleased to see that it was mr knightley's for mr knightley keeping no horses having little spare money and a great deal of health activity and independence was too apt in emma's opinion to get about as he could and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of donwell abbey she had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart for he stopped to hand her out,1,1,0.9959053228364393
me -- i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell's being so rich and so liberal -- it is a handsome present,1,1,0.8935668762904807
if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend mr dixon in them,1,1,0.8723310779525116
mr dixon -- very well yes i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr and mrs dixon we were speaking the other day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance,1,1,0.9693423299678637
and then he saved her life did you ever hear of that -- a water party and by some accident she was falling overboard he caught her,1,0,0.4264822546214565
were you really -- well -- but you observed nothing of course for it seems to be a new idea to you -- if i had been there i think i should have made some discoveries,1,1,0.6760425882804703
i dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr dixon caught her -- it was the work of a moment and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed i believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again -- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable i do not mean to say however that you might not have made discoveries,1,1,0.9348082063502469
no i am sure it is not from the campbells miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first she would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them i may not have convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr dixon is a principal in the business,1,1,0.9764016270596464
indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely at first while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw it only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world but when you mentioned mrs dixon i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love,1,1,0.913446834499943
the ladies had not been long in the drawing-room before the other ladies in their different divisions arrived emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner but could most heartily rejoice in that light cheerful unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection there she sat -- and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding to be in company nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed to sit and smile and look pretty and say nothing was enough for the happiness of the present hour jane fairfax did look and move superior but emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with harriet very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes of having loved even mr elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend,1,1,0.9955937278696205
mrs weston kind-hearted and musical was particularly interested by the circumstance and emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject and having so much to ask and to say as to tone touch and pedal totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible which she plainly read in the fair heroine's countenance,1,1,0.9785213001121316
perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out of so few in having your hair cut,1,1,0.6152851700573264
mr knightley and jane fairfax exclaimed emma dear mrs weston how could you think of such a thing -- mr knightley -- mr knightley must not marry -- you would not have little henry cut out from donwell -- oh no no henry must have donwell i cannot at all consent to mr knightley's marrying and i am sure it is not at all likely i am amazed that you should think of such a thing,1,1,0.9985081960701259
yes i would i could not bear to have henry supplanted -- mr knightley marry -- no i have never had such an idea and i cannot adopt it now and jane fairfax too of all women,1,1,0.9869659715373296
i am not speaking of its prudence merely its probability,1,1,0.6281988732758168
i often feel concern said she that i dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions it is not that i am without the wish but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should put-to for such a purpose,1,1,0.8873621454413447
while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off emma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste to look about and see what became of mr knightley this would be a trial he was no dancer in general if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now it might augur something there was no immediate appearance no he was talking to mrs cole -- he was looking on unconcerned jane was asked by somebody else and he was still talking to mrs cole,1,1,0.9902472993106607
perfect happiness even in memory is not common and there were two points on which she was not quite easy she doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman in betraying her suspicions of jane fairfax's feelings to frank churchill it was hardly right but it had been so strong an idea that it would escape her and his submission to all that she told was a compliment to her penetration which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue,1,1,0.984496742778382
oh dear -- i think you play the best of the two i think you play quite as well as she does i am sure i had much rather hear you every body last night said how well you played,1,1,0.5693952938287138
well i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out mr cole said how much taste you had and mr frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution,1,1,0.9593700662621671
they told me something said harriet rather hesitatingly but it is nothing of any consequence,1,1,0.8526079906003339
they told me -- that mr martin dined with them last saturday,1,1,0.829799105794285
he came to their father upon some business and he asked him to stay to dinner,1,0,0.4690169849320862
they talked a great deal about him especially anne cox i do not know what she meant but she asked me if i thought i should go and stay there again next summer,1,1,0.8347968369139273
she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox should be,1,1,0.76134141540422
very likely -- i think they are without exception the most vulgar girls in highbury,1,1,0.774947870829581
and while mrs weston pays her visit i may be allowed i hope said frank churchill to join your party and wait for her at hartfield -- if you are going home,1,1,0.9949564098350732
i thought you meant to go with me they would be very much pleased,1,1,0.7245844635467102
it is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble of two parcels,1,1,0.9268930307281299
busy as he was however the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing emma again,1,1,0.921881036480593
this is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated you find me trying to be useful tell me if you think i shall succeed,1,1,0.6819671677698921
it is not fair said emma in a whisper mine was a random guess do not distress her,1,1,0.754653298508294
if you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night -- let me live them over again you did not enjoy them as i did you appeared tired the whole time i believe you were glad we danced no longer but i would have given worlds -- all the worlds one ever has to give -- for another half-hour,1,1,0.586763279242158
but really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up the idea,1,1,0.748269503123588
how is your niece miss bates -- i want to inquire after you all but particularly your niece how is miss fairfax -- i hope she caught no cold last night how is she to-day tell me how miss fairfax is,1,1,0.9654647071428336
and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else the listeners were amused and mrs weston gave emma a look of particular meaning but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism,1,1,0.9851786216891719
no no your room is full enough i will call another day and hear the pianoforte,1,1,0.6098698990216177
yes said jane we heard his kind offers we heard every thing,1,1,0.7518049891489332
emma found it really time to be at home the visit had already lasted long and on examining watches so much of the morning was perceived to be gone that mrs weston and her companion taking leave also could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates before they set off for randalls,1,1,0.9830218450068843
and after all five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up five couple are nothing when one thinks seriously about it it will not do to invite five couple it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment,1,1,0.7528240024619745
somebody said that miss gilbert was expected at her brother's and must be invited with the rest somebody else believed mrs gilbert would have danced the other evening if she had been asked a word was put in for a second young cox and at last mr weston naming one family of cousins who must be included and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of,1,1,0.9802086164616032
emma demurred it would be a crowd -- a sad crowd and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in,1,1,0.5380433189693529
before the middle of the next day he was at hartfield and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement,1,1,0.8950423206466126
no he thought it very far from an improvement -- a very bad plan -- much worse than the other a room at an inn was always damp and dangerous never properly aired or fit to be inhabited if they must dance they had better dance at randalls he had never been in the room at the crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it by sight -- oh no -- a very bad plan they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere,1,1,0.8277846809568095
sir said mr woodhouse rather warmly you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr perry to be that sort of character mr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father's house,1,1,0.9767939382787205
emma said she this paper is worse than i expected look in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined,1,1,0.7107285923132102
my dear you are too particular said her husband what does all that signify you will see nothing of it by candlelight it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight we never see any thing of it on our club-nights,1,1,0.6223558697796273
the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant men never know when things are dirty or not and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares,1,1,0.5246920553091444
aye do frank -- go and fetch miss bates and let us end the matter at once she will enjoy the scheme i am sure and i do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties fetch miss bates we are growing a little too nice she is a standing lesson of how to be happy but fetch them both invite them both,1,1,0.8816031885592434
the old lady no the young lady to be sure i shall think you a great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece,1,1,0.8358884627613087
oh i beg your pardon sir i did not immediately recollect undoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both and away he ran,1,1,0.8826009730016348
this emma felt was aimed at her and it made her quite angry it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent or so indignant he was not guided by her feelings in reprobating the ball for she enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree it made her animated -- open hearted -- she voluntarily said --,1,1,0.9853025773579819
oh miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball what a disappointment it would be i do look forward to it i own with very great pleasure,1,1,0.953529583493746
the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma in a note from mrs weston instantly as to his going it was inevitable he must be gone within a few hours though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt to lessen his repugnance he knew her illnesses they never occurred but for her own convenience,1,1,0.9728574188725507
this wretched note was the finale of emma's breakfast when once it had been read there was no doing any thing but lament and exclaim the loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man -- and all that the young man might be feeling -- it was too wretched -- such a delightful evening as it would have been -- every body so happy and she and her partner the happiest -- i said it would be so was the only consolation,1,1,0.9638548384841547
ah -- shaking his head -- the uncertainty of when i may be able to return -- i shall try for it with a zeal -- it will be the object of all my thoughts and cares -- and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring -- but i am afraid -- they did not stir last spring -- i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever,1,1,0.673904147173046
he laughed rather consciously and though denying the sentiment emma was convinced that it had been so,1,1,0.8925516514746031
yes my father is to join me here we shall walk back together and i must be off immediately i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him,1,1,0.5535892896317494
you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck you are very much out of luck,1,1,0.718080988526448
upon the whole she was equally contented with her view of his feelings,1,1,0.76440031465425
there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart said she afterwards to herself there is nothing to be compared to it warmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner will beat all the clearness of head in the world for attraction i am sure it will it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives isabella all her popularity -- i have it not -- but i know how to prize and respect it -- harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives dear harriet -- i would not change you for the clearest-headed longest-sighted best-judging female breathing oh the coldness of a jane fairfax -- harriet is worth a hundred such -- and for a wife -- a sensible man's wife -- it is invaluable i mention no names but happy the man who changes emma for harriet,1,1,0.9855145177400169
as for mr elton his manners did not appear -- but no she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it the woman was better off she might have the assistance of fine clothes and the privilege of bashfulness but the man had only his own good sense to depend on and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor mr elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married the woman he had wanted to marry and the woman whom he had been expected to marry she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise and to be as much affectedly and as little really easy as could be,1,1,0.9819413051911491
very nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown,1,1,0.6878152634133292
i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love,1,1,0.6219906704937745
perhaps she might but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman who loves him best miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to have,1,1,0.9139789986845447
and the staircase -- you know as i came in i observed how very like the staircase was placed exactly in the same part of the house i really could not help exclaiming i assure you miss woodhouse it is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to as maple grove i have spent so many happy months there with a little sigh of sentiment a charming place undoubtedly every body who sees it is struck by its beauty but to me it has been quite a home whenever you are transplanted like me miss woodhouse you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony,1,1,0.982977285808869
no not immediately here we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of and we are a very quiet set of people i believe more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure,1,1,0.8451061920046724
it was as much as emma could bear without being impolite the idea of her being indebted to mrs elton for what was called an introduction -- of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of mrs elton's -- probably some vulgar dashing widow who with the help of a boarder just made a shift to live -- the dignity of miss woodhouse of hartfield was sunk indeed,1,1,0.9879966112559699
i should hope not but really when i look around among my acquaintance i tremble selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly and the same may be said of mrs jeffereys -- clara partridge that was -- and of the two milmans now mrs bird and mrs james cooper and of more than i can enumerate upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright i used to be quite angry with selina but really i begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper,1,1,0.895809700048775
knightley continued mrs elton knightley himself -- was not it lucky -- for not being within when he called the other day i had never seen him before and of course as so particular a friend of mr e 's i had a great curiosity my friend knightley' had been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend knightley is quite the gentleman i like him very much decidedly i think a very gentleman-like man,1,1,0.9796653607598408
well my dear he deliberately began considering we never saw her before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and i dare say she was very much pleased with you she speaks a little too quick a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear but i believe i am nice i do not like strange voices and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor however she seems a very obliging pretty-behaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife though i think he had better not have married i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs elton on this happy occasion i said that i hoped i should in the course of the summer but i ought to have gone before not to wait upon a bride is very remiss ah it shews what a sad invalid i am but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane,1,1,0.9836202285031017
my dear you do not understand me this is a matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry,1,1,0.70388921126769
in one respect mrs elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first her feelings altered towards emma -- offended probably by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant and though the effect was agreeable the ill-will which produced it was necessarily increasing emma's dislike her manners too -- and mr elton's were unpleasant towards harriet they were sneering and negligent emma hoped it must rapidly work harriet's cure but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much -- it was not to be doubted that poor harriet's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve and her own share in the story under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him had in all likelihood been given also she was of course the object of their joint dislike -- when they had nothing else to say it must be always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet,1,1,0.9991277510976898
mrs elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax and from the first not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other but from the very first and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration -- but without solicitation or plea or privilege she must be wanting to assist and befriend her -- before emma had forfeited her confidence and about the third time of their meeting she heard all mrs elton's knight-errantry on the subject --,1,1,0.9948855327667541
jane fairfax is absolutely charming miss woodhouse -- i quite rave about jane fairfax -- a sweet interesting creature so mild and ladylike -- and with such talents -- i assure you i think she has very extraordinary talents i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well i know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point oh she is absolutely charming you will laugh at my warmth -- but upon my word i talk of nothing but jane fairfax -- and her situation is so calculated to affect one -- miss woodhouse we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her we must bring her forward such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown -- i dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet,1,1,0.9966298078188981
poor jane fairfax -- thought emma -- you have not deserved this you may have done wrong with regard to mr dixon but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited -- the kindness and protection of mrs elton -- jane fairfax and jane fairfax ' heavens let me not suppose that she dares go about emma woodhouse-ing me -- but upon my honour there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman's tongue,1,1,0.9947839808060697
such attentions as mrs elton's i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton's invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting,1,1,0.9936188243945913
i should not wonder said mrs weston if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt's eagerness in accepting mrs elton's civilities for her poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change,1,1,0.9982348606217482
yes he replied any body may know how highly i think of her,1,1,0.7562578070700617
yes very soon he gave me a quiet hint i told him he was mistaken he asked my pardon and said no more cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours,1,1,0.844553442921927
emma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner at hartfield for the eltons they must not do less than others or she should be exposed to odious suspicions and imagined capable of pitiful resentment a dinner there must be after emma had talked about it for ten minutes mr woodhouse felt no unwillingness and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him,1,1,0.9899896221087892
the event was more favourable to mr woodhouse than to emma john knightley came but mr weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day he might be able to join them in the evening but certainly not to dinner mr woodhouse was quite at ease and the seeing him so with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate removed the chief of even emma's vexation,1,1,0.9968316562048072
the day came the party were punctually assembled and mr john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner he was talking to miss fairfax mrs elton as elegant as lace and pearls could make her he looked at in silence -- wanting only to observe enough for isabella's information -- but miss fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl and he could talk to her he had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys when it had been just beginning to rain it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject and he said,1,1,0.9974457396847812
my dear miss fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for -- i hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well they are some of my very old friends i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour you do us a great deal of honour to-day i am sure my daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield,1,1,0.9797603481955182
the kind-hearted polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty and made every fair lady welcome and easy,1,1,0.5787579748796466
by this time the walk in the rain had reached mrs elton and her remonstrances now opened upon jane,1,1,0.9446550619335085
oh do not tell me you really are a very sad girl and do not know how to take care of yourself -- to the post-office indeed mrs weston did you ever hear the like you and i must positively exert our authority,1,1,0.8100207608091874
my dear jane say no more about it the thing is determined that is laughing affectedly as far as i can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master you know mrs weston you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves but i do flatter myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely worn out if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore consider that point as settled,1,1,0.9603512444075578
the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual observations made,1,1,0.8028042819334926
mrs weston was disengaged and emma began again -- mr frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman's hands i ever saw,1,1,0.985964842493371
i do not admire it said mr knightley it is too small -- wants strength it is like a woman's writing,1,1,0.7720477452345608
oh when a gallant young man like mr frank churchill said mr knightley dryly writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse he will of course put forth his best,1,1,0.9538187661622904
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties -- with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs elton engross jane fairfax and slight herself she and mrs weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together mrs elton left them no choice if jane repressed her for a little time she soon began again and though much that passed between them was in a half-whisper especially on mrs elton's side there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects the post-office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship were long under discussion and to them succeeded one which must be at least equally unpleasant to jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her and professions of mrs elton's meditated activity,1,1,0.9995987784797254
here is april come said she i get quite anxious about you june will soon be here,1,1,0.6398612635963619
i have not even made any inquiry i do not wish to make any yet,1,1,0.7032228547056693
but you have not seen so much of the world as i have you do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove a cousin of mr suckling mrs bragge had such an infinity of applications every body was anxious to be in her family for she moves in the first circle wax-candles in the schoolroom you may imagine how desirable of all houses in the kingdom mrs bragge's is the one i would most wish to see you in,1,1,0.9521265485581469
mr weston however too eager to be very observant too communicative to want others to talk was very well satisfied with what she did say and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already,1,1,0.9469909267311216
the evil of the distance from enscombe said mr weston is that mrs churchill as we understand has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together in frank's last letter she complained he said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle's this you know speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town that she means to sleep only two nights on the road -- so frank writes word certainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions mrs elton you must grant me that,1,1,0.9876597448134073
oh mr weston do not mistake me selina is no fine lady i assure you do not run away with such an idea,1,1,0.9160860839077077
mrs churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspect -- but this is quite between ourselves she is very fond of frank and therefore i would not speak ill of her besides she is out of health now but that indeed by her own account she has always been i would not say so to every body mrs elton but i have not much faith in mrs churchill's illness,1,1,0.9942050733552368
so i remember to have heard he will find an addition to the society of highbury when he comes again that is if i may presume to call myself an addition but perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world,1,1,0.7736905116297426
when frank left us continued he it was quite uncertain when we might see him again which makes this day's news doubly welcome it has been completely unexpected that is i always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me he and mrs weston were both dreadfully desponding how could he contrive to come and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ' and so forth -- i always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see i have observed mrs elton in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next,1,1,0.971259358286784
there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be witness this very time here am i come down for only one day and you are engaged with a dinner-party -- when did it happen before or any thing like it your neighbourhood is increasing and you mix more with it a little while ago every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties dinners at mr cole's or balls at the crown the difference which randalls randalls alone makes in your goings-on is very great,1,1,0.9622742670120086
mr weston's own happiness was indisputable he was quite delighted it was the very circumstance he could have wished for now it would be really having frank in their neighbourhood what were nine miles to a young man -- an hour's ride he would be always coming over the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never sixteen miles -- nay eighteen -- it must be full eighteen to manchester-street -- was a serious obstacle were he ever able to get away the day would be spent in coming and returning there was no comfort in having him in london he might as well be at enscombe but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse better than nearer,1,1,0.986959880602467
no misfortune occurred again to prevent the ball the day approached the day arrived and after a morning of some anxious watching frank churchill in all the certainty of his own self reached randalls before dinner and every thing was safe,1,1,0.9370461308921755
in a few minutes the carriage returned -- somebody talked of rain -- i will see that there are umbrellas sir said frank to his father miss bates must not be forgotten and away he went mr weston was following but mrs elton detained him to gratify him by her opinion of his son and so briskly did she begin that the young man himself though by no means moving slowly could hardly be out of hearing,1,1,0.9844872552816984
a very fine young man indeed mr weston you know i candidly told you i should form my own opinion and i am happy to say that i am extremely pleased with him -- you may believe me i never compliment i think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what i like and approve -- so truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies -- quite a horror of them they were never tolerated at maple grove neither mr suckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we used sometimes to say very cutting things selina who is mild almost to a fault bore with them much better,1,1,0.9661846878582693
he shook his head but there was a smile of indulgence with it and he only said,1,0,0.34324529058178144
indeed i will you have shewn that you can dance and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper,1,1,0.7976473076253365
having arranged all these matters looked them through and put them all to rights she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys as well as of their grandpapa when the great iron sweep-gate opened and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together -- frank churchill with harriet leaning on his arm -- actually harriet -- a moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened harriet looked white and frightened and he was trying to cheer her -- the iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder -- they were all three soon in the hall and harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away,1,1,0.859788582658081
this was the amount of the whole story -- of his communication and of harriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech -- he dared not stay longer than to see her well these several delays left him not another minute to lose and emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to mrs goddard and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr knightley he set off with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself,1,1,0.9857752952757011
such an adventure as this -- a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain so emma thought at least could a linguist could a grammarian could even a mathematician have seen what she did have witnessed their appearance together and heard their history of it without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other -- how much more must an imaginist like herself be on fire with speculation and foresight -- especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made,1,1,0.9168611027242618
in the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him while harriet had been partially insensible he had spoken of her terror her naivete her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm with a sensibility amused and delighted and just at last after harriet's own account had been given he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms every thing was to take its natural course however neither impelled nor assisted she would not stir a step nor drop a hint no she had had enough of interference there could be no harm in a scheme a mere passive scheme it was no more than a wish beyond it she would on no account proceed,1,1,0.9874454992018713
a very few days had passed after this adventure when harriet came one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand and after sitting down and hesitating thus began,1,1,0.838774102804134
no -- i cannot call them gifts but they are things that i have valued very much,1,0,0.4268999664764061
she held the parcel towards her and emma read the words most precious treasures on the top her curiosity was greatly excited harriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with impatience within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridge-ware box which harriet opened it was well lined with the softest cotton but excepting the cotton emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister,1,1,0.7915805916377922
and had you really some at hand yourself i am sure i never suspected it you did it so naturally,1,1,0.6818290491035803
this was really his said harriet -- do not you remember one morning -- no i dare say you do not but one morning -- i forget exactly the day -- but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before that evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book it was about spruce-beer mr knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce-beer and he wanted to put it down but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the table as good for nothing but i kept my eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment,1,1,0.7630098078145764
it is very natural it is natural and it is honourable -- yes honourable i think to chuse so well and so gratefully -- but that it will be a fortunate preference is more that i can promise i do not advise you to give way to it harriet i do not by any means engage for its being returned consider what you are about perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can at any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you be observant of him let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations i give you this caution now because i shall never speak to you again on the subject i am determined against all interference henceforward i know nothing of the matter let no name ever pass our lips we were very wrong before we will be cautious now -- he is your superior no doubt and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature but yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have been matches of greater disparity but take care of yourself i would not have you too sanguine though however it may end be assured your raising your thoughts to him is a mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value,1,1,0.9616255716279859
harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind -- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation,1,1,0.9773803828416519
brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking of private understanding even between frank churchill and jane,1,1,0.9368026894598201
he had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did to spend his evening at hartfield emma and harriet were going to walk he joined them and on returning they fell in with a larger party who like themselves judged it wisest to take their exercise early as the weather threatened rain mr and mrs weston and their son miss bates and her niece who had accidentally met they all united and on reaching hartfield gates emma who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him the randalls party agreed to it immediately and after a pretty long speech from miss bates which few persons listened to she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouse's most obliging invitation,1,1,0.9985679225359024
mrs weston looked surprized and said i did not know that he ever had any such plan,1,1,0.9682386132509205
emma was out of hearing she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance and was beyond the reach of mr weston's hint,1,1,0.9334597652512258
they were entering the hall mr knightley's eyes had preceded miss bates's in a glance at jane from frank churchill's face where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away he had involuntarily turned to hers but she was indeed behind and too busy with her shawl mr weston had walked in the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass mr knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye -- he seemed watching her intently -- in vain however if it were so -- jane passed between them into the hall and looked at neither,1,1,0.9875877393958304
there was no time for farther remark or explanation the dream must be borne with and mr knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use instead of the small-sized pembroke on which two of his daily meals had for forty years been crowded tea passed pleasantly and nobody seemed in a hurry to move,1,1,0.8739876455145996
miss woodhouse said frank churchill after examining a table behind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters it used to stand here where is it this is a sort of dull-looking evening that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer we had great amusement with those letters one morning i want to puzzle you again,1,1,0.8330979253618348
he remained at hartfield after all the rest his thoughts full of what he had seen so full that when the candles came to assist his observations he must -- yes he certainly must as a friend -- an anxious friend -- give emma some hint ask her some question he could not see her in a situation of such danger without trying to preserve her it was his duty,1,1,0.9484556163650283
emma was extremely confused she could not endure to give him the true explanation for though her suspicions were by no means removed she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them,1,1,0.9623193516030955
oh she cried in evident embarrassment it all meant nothing a mere joke among ourselves,1,0,0.4721667261101647
the joke he replied gravely seemed confined to you and mr churchill,1,1,0.7590899479849941
you may depend upon me said she i certainly will come name your day and i will come you will allow me to bring jane fairfax,1,1,0.8672306924269213
oh leave all that to me only give me a carte-blanche -- i am lady patroness you know it is my party i will bring friends with me,1,1,0.6462364358018459
i hope you will bring elton said he but i will not trouble you to give any other invitations,1,1,0.8111211787280089
no -- he calmly replied -- there is but one married woman in the world whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell and that one is --,1,1,0.790625804433162
ah you are an odd creature she cried satisfied to have no one preferred to herself -- you are a humourist and may say what you like quite a humourist well i shall bring jane with me -- jane and her aunt -- the rest i leave to you i have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family don't scruple i know you are attached to them,1,1,0.9313155872109595
you certainly will meet them if i can prevail and i shall call on miss bates in my way home,1,1,0.8464989208763082
well -- as you please only don't have a great set out and by the bye can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion -- pray be sincere knightley if you wish me to talk to mrs hodges or to inspect anything --,1,1,0.8223423097618804
well -- but if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper is extremely clever,1,1,0.844225830909908
such for half an hour was the conversation -- interrupted only once by mrs weston who came out in her solicitude after her son-in-law to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy -- she had some fears of his horse,1,1,0.9373506595686656
seats tolerably in the shade were found and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs elton and jane fairfax were talking of -- a situation a most desirable situation was in question mrs elton had received notice of it that morning and was in raptures it was not with mrs suckling it was not with mrs bragge but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them it was with a cousin of mrs bragge an acquaintance of mrs suckling a lady known at maple grove delightful charming superior first circles spheres lines ranks every thing -- and mrs elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately -- on her side all was warmth energy and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend's negative though miss fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before -- still mrs elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow's post -- how jane could bear it at all was astonishing to emma -- she did look vexed she did speak pointedly -- and at last with a decision of action unusual to her proposed a removal -- should not they walk would not mr knightley shew them the gardens -- all the gardens -- she wished to see the whole extent -- the pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear,1,1,0.999540037723157
the next remove was to the house they must all go in and eat -- and they were all seated and busy and still frank churchill did not come mrs weston looked and looked in vain his father would not own himself uneasy and laughed at her fears but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare he had expressed himself as to coming with more than common certainty his aunt was so much better that he had not a doubt of getting over to them -- mrs churchill's state however as many were ready to remind her was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence -- and mrs weston was at last persuaded to believe or to say that it must be by some attack of mrs churchill that he was prevented coming -- emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion,1,1,0.9973893816171661
mr knightley had done all in his power for mr woodhouse's entertainment books of engravings drawers of medals cameos corals shells and every other family collection within his cabinets had been prepared for his old friend to while away the morning and the kindness had perfectly answered mr woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused mrs weston had been shewing them all to him and now he would shew them all to emma -- fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child than in a total want of taste for what he saw for he was slow constant and methodical -- before this second looking over was begun however emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the house -- and was hardly there when jane fairfax appeared coming quickly in from the garden and with a look of escape -- little expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon there was a start at first but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of,1,1,0.9941372113183014
will you be so kind said she when i am missed as to say that i am gone home -- i am going this moment -- my aunt is not aware how late it is nor how long we have been absent -- but i am sure we shall be wanted and i am determined to go directly -- i have said nothing about it to any body it would only be giving trouble and distress some are gone to the ponds and some to the lime walk till they all come in i shall not be missed and when they do will you have the goodness to say that i am gone,1,1,0.8298248960846616
but it is too far indeed it is to be walking quite alone let my father's servant go with you -- let me order the carriage it can be round in five minutes,1,0,0.4521622155025696
he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal and came back all the better -- grown quite cool -- and with good manners like himself -- able to draw a chair close to them take an interest in their employment and regret in a reasonable way that he should be so late he was not in his best spirits but seemed trying to improve them and at last made himself talk nonsense very agreeably they were looking over views in swisserland,1,1,0.8521413228074785
no -- it will not be worth while if i come i shall be cross,1,0,0.4147974443615783
how much i am obliged to you said he for telling me to come to-day -- if it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party i had quite determined to go away again,1,1,0.9196651900040177
yes you were very cross and i do not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries i was a kinder friend than you deserved but you were humble you begged hard to be commanded to come,1,1,0.592813402436929
not to my feelings i am perfectly comfortable to-day,1,1,0.8912914147213414
it comes to the same thing i can have no self-command without a motive you order me whether you speak or not and you can be always with me you are always with me,1,1,0.5026912928747539
i say nothing of which i am ashamed replied he with lively impudence i saw you first in february let every body on the hill hear me if they can let my accents swell to mickleham on one side and dorking on the other i saw you first in february and then whispering -- our companions are excessively stupid what shall we do to rouse them any nonsense will serve they shall talk ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse who wherever she is presides to say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of,1,1,0.700328838466801
some laughed and answered good-humouredly miss bates said a great deal mrs elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouse's presiding mr knightley's answer was the most distinct,1,1,0.9862874633973502
oh no no -- cried emma laughing as carelessly as she could -- upon no account in the world it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of i will not say quite all there are one or two perhaps glancing at mr weston and harriet whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing,1,1,0.8978132313989051
it is a sort of thing cried mrs elton emphatically which i should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into though perhaps as the chaperon of the party -- i never was in any circle -- exploring parties -- young ladies -- married women --,1,1,0.967854823236603
very true my love very true exactly so indeed -- quite unheard of -- but some ladies say any thing better pass it off as a joke every body knows what is due to you,1,1,0.7265646050303779
what two letters -- express perfection i am sure i do not know,1,1,0.6645894860274337
miss fairfax who had seldom spoken before except among her own confederates spoke now,1,1,0.89152809835604
such things do occur undoubtedly -- she was stopped by a cough frank churchill turned towards her to listen,1,1,0.8978435354005111
emma recollected blushed was sorry but tried to laugh it off,1,1,0.8612965867560473
they are blended said he i acknowledge and were she prosperous i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good were she a woman of fortune i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner were she your equal in situation -- but emma consider how far this is from being the case she is poor she has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live to old age must probably sink more her situation should secure your compassion it was badly done indeed you whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble her -- and before her niece too -- and before others many of whom certainly some would be entirely guided by your treatment of her -- this is not pleasant to you emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me but i must i will -- i will tell you truths while i can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now,1,1,0.9773852487162507
time did not compose her as she reflected more she seemed but to feel it more she never had been so depressed happily it was not necessary to speak there was only harriet who seemed not in spirits herself fagged and very willing to be silent and emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home without being at any trouble to check them extraordinary as they were,1,1,0.9582492221598001
the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emma's thoughts all the evening how it might be considered by the rest of the party she could not tell they in their different homes and their different ways might be looking back on it with pleasure but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time and more to be abhorred in recollection than any she had ever passed a whole evening of back-gammon with her father was felicity to it there indeed lay real pleasure for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort and feeling that unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem she could not in her general conduct be open to any severe reproach as a daughter she hoped she was not without a heart she hoped no one could have said to her how could you be so unfeeling to your father -- i must i will tell you truths while i can miss bates should never again -- no never if attention in future could do away the past she might hope to be forgiven she had been often remiss her conscience told her so remiss perhaps more in thought than fact scornful ungracious but it should be so no more in the warmth of true contrition she would call upon her the very next morning and it should be the beginning on her side of a regular equal kindly intercourse,1,1,0.9953925500182076
the ladies were all at home she had never rejoiced at the sound before nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs with any wish of giving pleasure but in conferring obligation or of deriving it except in subsequent ridicule,1,1,0.8155416485616823
there was no bearing such an always and to break through her dreadful gratitude emma made the direct inquiry of --,1,1,0.8360886678387817
yes all of us mrs elton would have us come it was settled so upon the hill while we were walking about with mr knightley you must all spend your evening with us ' said she -- i positively must have you all come ',1,1,0.9134585218595429
no not mr knightley he declined it from the first and though i thought he would come because mrs elton declared she would not let him off he did not -- but my mother and jane and i were all there and a very agreeable evening we had such kind friends you know miss woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning's party even pleasure you know is fatiguing -- and i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it however i shall always think it a very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it,1,1,0.9969857846047926
her friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not colonel and mrs campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return,1,1,0.9774622575600017
miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr frank churchill's going she proceeded to give them all it was of no consequence,1,1,0.9957490082803641
nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme,1,0,0.4795851846293324
yes -- rather -- i have been thinking of it some little time,1,1,0.6347016052194954
emma was sure he had not forgiven her he looked unlike himself time however she thought would tell him that they ought to be friends again while he stood as if meaning to go but not going -- her father began his inquiries,1,1,0.8967236072749937
well my dear and did you get there safely -- and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter -- i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming dear emma has been to call on mrs and miss bates mr knightley as i told you before she is always so attentive to them,1,1,0.9911371434956061
emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier -- it would have been a great pleasure to talk over jane fairfax's situation with mr knightley -- neither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it might have happened at a better time -- and to have had longer notice of it would have been pleasanter -- they parted thorough friends however she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance and his unfinished gallantry -- it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion -- he had been sitting with them half an hour she found it was a pity that she had not come back earlier,1,1,0.998650225197301
in the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the disagreeableness of mr knightley's going to london and going so suddenly and going on horseback which she knew would be all very bad emma communicated her news of jane fairfax and her dependence on the effect was justified it supplied a very useful check -- interested without disturbing him he had long made up his mind to jane fairfax's going out as governess and could talk of it cheerfully but mr knightley's going to london had been an unexpected blow,1,1,0.9888838741908038
poor mrs churchill no doubt she had been suffering a great deal more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper it was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults what would mr churchill do without her mr churchill's loss would be dreadful indeed mr churchill would never get over it -- even mr weston shook his head and looked solemn and said ah poor woman who would have thought it and resolved that his mourning should be as handsome as possible and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense true and steady how it would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both it was also a very early speculation with emma the character of mrs churchill the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event how benefited how freed she saw in a moment all the possible good now an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter mr churchill independent of his wife was feared by nobody an easy guidable man to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew all that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form the attachment as with all her goodwill in the cause emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed,1,1,0.9985290596646453
it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax whose prospects were closing while harriet's opened and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury who wished to shew her kindness -- and with emma it was grown into a first wish she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness and the person whom she had been so many months neglecting was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy she wanted to be of use to her wanted to shew a value for her society and testify respect and consideration she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield a note was written to urge it the invitation was refused and by a verbal message miss fairfax was not well enough to write and when mr perry called at hartfield the same morning it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited though against her own consent by himself and that she was suffering under severe headaches and a nervous fever to a degree which made him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs smallridge's at the time proposed her health seemed for the moment completely deranged -- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms nothing touching the pulmonary complaint which was the standing apprehension of the family mr perry was uneasy about her he thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to and that she felt it so herself though she would not own it her spirits seemed overcome her present home he could not but observe was unfavourable to a nervous disorder -- confined always to one room -- he could have wished it otherwise -- and her good aunt though his very old friend he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description her care and attention could not be questioned they were in fact only too great he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more evil than good from them emma listened with the warmest concern grieved for her more and more and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful to take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt to give her change of air and scene and quiet rational conversation even for an hour or two might do her good and the following morning she wrote again to say in the most feeling language she could command that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name -- mentioning that she had mr perry's decided opinion in favour of such exercise for his patient the answer was only in this short note,1,1,0.999727773680043
certainly this moment if you please it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way but what can be the matter -- is she really not ill,1,1,0.6347679964367013
mrs weston was looking so ill and had an air of so much perturbation that emma's uneasiness increased and the moment they were alone she eagerly said,1,1,0.9648470268038777
what is it my dear friend something of a very unpleasant nature i find has occurred -- do let me know directly what it is i have been walking all this way in complete suspense we both abhor suspense do not let mine continue longer it will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be,1,1,0.7394393461905127
have you indeed no idea said mrs weston in a trembling voice cannot you my dear emma -- cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear,1,1,0.865738552433133
she stopped to breathe emma thought first of herself and then of harriet,1,1,0.9200424606015684
you are in luck -- your only blunder was confined to my ear when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady,1,1,0.5780109587727035
at this moment mr weston appeared at a little distance from the window evidently on the watch his wife gave him a look which invited him in and while he was coming round added now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match let us make the best of it -- and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour it is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for -- and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right and how much may be said in her situation for even that error,1,1,0.984896956235424
harriet poor harriet -- those were the words in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of and which constituted the real misery of the business to her frank churchill had behaved very ill by herself -- very ill in many ways -- but it was not so much his behaviour as her own which made her so angry with him it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriet's account that gave the deepest hue to his offence -- poor harriet to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery mr knightley had spoken prophetically when he once said emma you have been no friend to harriet smith -- she was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice -- it was true that she had not to charge herself in this instance as in the former with being the sole and original author of the mischief with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered harriet's imagination for harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments her influence would have been enough and now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them -- she felt that she had been risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds common sense would have directed her to tell harriet that she must not allow herself to think of him and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her -- but with common sense she added i am afraid i have had little to do,1,1,0.9990947704885482
in spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet which mrs weston had just gone through by herself the intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her she was now to be anxiously announcing to another her heart beat quick on hearing harriet's footstep and voice so she supposed had poor mrs weston felt when she was approaching randalls could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance -- but of that unfortunately there could be no chance,1,1,0.9938664016970811
oh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr frank churchill are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while how very odd,1,1,0.9811533452799784
it was indeed so odd harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd that emma did not know how to understand it her character appeared absolutely changed she seemed to propose shewing no agitation or disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery emma looked at her quite unable to speak,1,1,0.9907035851730899
harriet cried emma collecting herself resolutely -- let us understand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake are you speaking of -- mr knightley,1,1,0.9612303929335708
oh dear cried harriet now i recollect what you mean but i was thinking of something very different at the time it was not the gipsies -- it was not mr frank churchill that i meant no with some elevation i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance -- of mr knightley's coming and asking me to dance when mr elton would not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in the room that was the kind action that was the noble benevolence and generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth,1,1,0.9559495665681866
i do not wonder miss woodhouse she resumed that you should feel a great difference between the two as to me or as to any body you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other but i hope miss woodhouse that supposing -- that if -- strange as it may appear -- but you know they were your own words that more wonderful things had happened matches of greater disparity had taken place than between mr frank churchill and me and therefore it seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before -- and if i should be so fortunate beyond expression as to -- if mr knightley should really -- if he does not mind the disparity i hope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way but you are too good for that i am sure,1,1,0.9768675723712315
have you any idea of mr knightley's returning your affection,1,1,0.9580666682676041
yes replied harriet modestly but not fearfully -- i must say that i have,1,1,0.7896692959105333
i never should have presumed to think of it at first said she but for you you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mine -- and so i have but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful,1,1,0.8131437692311759
harriet i will only venture to declare that mr knightley is the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does,1,1,0.9608173188675282
harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness which at that moment would have been dreadful penance by the sound of her father's footsteps he was coming through the hall harriet was too much agitated to encounter him she could not compose herself -- mr woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go -- with most ready encouragement from her friend therefore she passed off through another door -- and the moment she was gone this was the spontaneous burst of emma's feelings oh god that i had never seen her,1,1,0.9794161072627728
to understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the first endeavour to that point went every leisure moment which her father's claims on her allowed and every moment of involuntary absence of mind,1,1,0.8910265883837196
mr weston had accompanied her to mrs bates's and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely but she having then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing was now returned with much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs bates's parlour with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded,1,1,0.9975316254270836
a little curiosity emma had and she made the most of it while her friend related mrs weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present to be allowed merely to write to miss fairfax instead and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed and mr churchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known as considering every thing she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports -- but mr weston had thought differently he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it or if it were that it would be of any consequence for such things he observed always got about emma smiled and felt that mr weston had very good reason for saying so they had gone in short -- and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady she had hardly been able to speak a word and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness the quiet heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady and the rapturous delight of her daughter -- who proved even too joyous to talk as usual had been a gratifying yet almost an affecting scene they were both so truly respectable in their happiness so disinterested in every sensation thought so much of jane so much of every body and so little of themselves that every kindly feeling was at work for them miss fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for mrs weston to invite her to an airing she had drawn back and declined at first but on being pressed had yielded and in the course of their drive mrs weston had by gentle encouragement overcome so much of her embarrassment as to bring her to converse on the important subject apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr weston must necessarily open the cause but when these effusions were put by they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement mrs weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject,1,1,0.9998099556795593
poor girl said emma she thinks herself wrong then for having consented to a private engagement,1,1,0.932321719563398
poor girl said emma again she loves him then excessively i suppose it must have been from attachment only that she could be led to form the engagement her affection must have overpowered her judgment,1,1,0.9844839922459168
they walked together he was silent she thought he was often looking at her and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give and this belief produced another dread perhaps he wanted to speak to her of his attachment to harriet he might be watching for encouragement to begin -- she did not could not feel equal to lead the way to any such subject he must do it all himself yet she could not bear this silence with him it was most unnatural she considered -- resolved -- and trying to smile began --,1,1,0.9488697222331556
how is it possible cried emma turning her glowing cheeks towards him for while she spoke it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs goddard's in his way,1,1,0.9596597362576336
for a moment or two nothing was said and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest till she found her arm drawn within his and pressed against his heart and heard him thus saying in a tone of great sensibility speaking low,1,1,0.8355014398252476
emma cried he looking eagerly at her are you indeed -- but checking himself -- no no i understand you -- forgive me -- i am pleased that you can say even so much -- he is no object of regret indeed and it will not be very long i hope before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason -- fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled -- i could never i confess from your manners assure myself as to the degree of what you felt -- i could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which i never believed him to deserve -- he is a disgrace to the name of man -- and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman -- jane jane you will be a miserable creature,1,1,0.985729704645215
i have very little to say for my own conduct -- i was tempted by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased -- an old story probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding many circumstances assisted the temptation he was the son of mr weston -- he was continually here -- i always found him very pleasant -- and in short for with a sigh let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered and i allowed his attentions latterly however -- for some time indeed -- i have had no idea of their meaning any thing -- i thought them a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side he has imposed on me but he has not injured me i have never been attached to him and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour he never wished to attach me it was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another -- it was his object to blind all about him and no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myself -- except that i was not blinded -- that it was my good fortune -- that in short i was somehow or other safe from him,1,1,0.9598010635486274
i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill -- i can suppose however that i may have underrated him my acquaintance with him has been but trifling -- and even if i have not underrated him hitherto he may yet turn out well -- with such a woman he has a chance -- i have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct i shall certainly wish him well,1,1,0.9790037718994845
he is a most fortunate man returned mr knightley with energy so early in life -- at three-and-twenty -- a period when if a man chuses a wife he generally chuses ill at three-and-twenty to have drawn such a prize what years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before him -- assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love for jane fairfax's character vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour -- equality of situation -- i mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one -- and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants -- a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of her regard must i think be the happiest of mortals -- frank churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune every thing turns out for his good -- he meets with a young woman at a watering-place gains her affection cannot even weary her by negligent treatment -- and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him they could not have found her superior -- his aunt is in the way -- his aunt dies -- he has only to speak -- his friends are eager to promote his happiness -- he had used every body ill -- and they are all delighted to forgive him -- he is a fortunate man indeed,1,1,0.987321605923947
you will not ask me what is the point of envy -- you are determined i see to have no curiosity -- you are wise -- but i cannot be wise emma i must tell you what you will not ask though i may wish it unsaid the next moment,1,1,0.764552654838769
as a friend -- repeated mr knightley -- emma that i fear is a word -- no i have no wish -- stay yes why should i hesitate -- i have gone too far already for concealment -- emma i accept your offer -- extraordinary as it may seem i accept it and refer myself to you as a friend -- tell me then have i no chance of ever succeeding,1,1,0.8938557841809878
he stopped in his earnestness to look the question and the expression of his eyes overpowered her,1,0,0.49897505214872767
he had in fact been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence he had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it he had come in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchill's engagement with no selfish view no view at all but of endeavouring if she allowed him an opening to soothe or to counsel her -- the rest had been the work of the moment the immediate effect of what he heard on his feelings the delightful assurance of her total indifference towards frank churchill of her having a heart completely disengaged from him had given birth to the hope that in time he might gain her affection himself -- but it had been no present hope -- he had only in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her -- the superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting -- the affection which he had been asking to be allowed to create if he could was already his -- within half an hour he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind to something so like perfect happiness that it could bear no other name,1,1,0.9919672161735168
her change was equal -- this one half-hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance jealousy or distrust -- on his side there had been a long-standing jealousy old as the arrival or even the expectation of frank churchill -- he had been in love with emma and jealous of frank churchill from about the same period one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other it was his jealousy of frank churchill that had taken him from the country -- the box hill party had decided him on going away he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted encouraged attentions -- he had gone to learn to be indifferent -- but he had gone to a wrong place there was too much domestic happiness in his brother's house woman wore too amiable a form in it isabella was too much like emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities which always brought the other in brilliancy before him for much to have been done even had his time been longer -- he had stayed on however vigorously day after day -- till this very morning's post had conveyed the history of jane fairfax -- then with the gladness which must be felt nay which he did not scruple to feel having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma was there so much fond solicitude so much keen anxiety for her that he could stay no longer he had ridden home through the rain and had walked up directly after dinner to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures faultless in spite of all her faults bore the discovery,1,1,0.9956212327001018
poor mr woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride -- could he have seen the heart he would have cared very little for the lungs but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr perry and talked on with much self-contentment totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return,1,1,0.9283294118265263
he had not left her long by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else when a letter was brought her from randalls -- a very thick letter -- she guessed what it must contain and deprecated the necessity of reading it -- she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill she wanted no explanations she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself -- and as for understanding any thing he wrote she was sure she was incapable of it -- it must be waded through however she opened the packet it was too surely so -- a note from mrs weston to herself ushered in the letter from frank to mrs weston,1,1,0.9922654381307061
she thought so well of the letter that when mr knightley came again she desired him to read it she was sure of mrs weston's wishing it to be communicated especially to one who like mr knightley had seen so much to blame in his conduct,1,1,0.9933964988149581
it will be natural for me he added shortly afterwards to speak my opinion aloud as i read by doing it i shall feel that i am near you it will not be so great a loss of time but if you dislike it --,1,1,0.8385275745107983
and i have not forgotten said emma how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would you pass it over very handsomely -- but you were perfectly right,1,1,0.8103182483261004
when he came to miss woodhouse he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud -- all that related to her with a smile a look a shake of the head a word or two of assent or disapprobation or merely of love as the subject required concluding however seriously and after steady reflection thus --,1,1,0.8499678810005616
he did so but very soon stopt again to say the pianoforte ah that was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure a boyish scheme indeed -- i cannot comprehend a man's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument's coming if she could,1,1,0.975973567824659
i perfectly agree with you sir -- was then his remark you did behave very shamefully you never wrote a truer line and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement and his persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfax's sense of right he made a fuller pause to say this is very bad -- he had induced her to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily -- she must have had much more to contend with in carrying on the correspondence than he could he should have respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers were all reasonable we must look to her one fault and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment,1,1,0.9881295652920049
i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him,1,1,0.6054627912749666
it is remarkable that emma in the many very many points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry whose rights as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of mr knightley's marrying jane fairfax or any body else which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt,1,1,0.9930258060782485
she would have been too happy but for poor harriet but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend who must now be even excluded from hartfield the delightful family party which emma was securing for herself poor harriet must in mere charitable caution be kept at a distance from she would be a loser in every way emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment in such a party harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise but for the poor girl herself it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment,1,1,0.9944725589248307
harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed without reproaches or apparent sense of ill-usage and yet emma fancied there was a something of resentment a something bordering on it in her style which increased the desirableness of their being separate -- it might be only her own consciousness but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke,1,1,0.9684256073696916
she soon resolved equally as a duty and a pleasure to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax -- she ought to go -- and she was longing to see her the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill it would be a secret satisfaction but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate,1,1,0.9933300153158632
she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs elton's thoughts and understand why she was like herself in happy spirits it was being in miss fairfax's confidence and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face and while paying her own compliments to mrs bates and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side saying with significant nods,1,1,0.9908182917514802
we can finish this some other time you know you and i shall not want opportunities and in fact you have heard all the essential already i only wanted to prove to you that mrs s admits our apology and is not offended you see how delightfully she writes oh she is a sweet creature you would have doated on her had you gone -- but not a word more let us be discreet -- quite on our good behaviour -- hush -- you remember those lines -- i forget the poem at this moment,1,1,0.6457664790061559
now i say my dear in our case for lady read -- -- mum a word to the wise -- i am in a fine flow of spirits an't i but i want to set your heart at ease as to mrs s -- my representation you see has quite appeased her,1,1,0.8048535245117466
do not you think miss woodhouse our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered -- do not you think her cure does perry the highest credit -- here was a side-glance of great meaning at jane upon my word perry has restored her in a wonderful short time -- oh if you had seen her as i did when she was at the worst -- and when mrs bates was saying something to emma whispered farther we do not say a word of any assistance that perry might have not a word of a certain young physician from windsor -- oh no perry shall have all the credit,1,1,0.9885428476186865
oh no the meeting is certainly to-day was the abrupt answer which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs elton's side -- i do believe she continued this is the most troublesome parish that ever was we never heard of such things at maple grove,1,1,0.9469697258036744
upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject talked of,1,1,0.7714784407271189
ah you clever creature that's very true what a thinking brain you have i say jane what a perfect character you and i should make if we could be shaken together my liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection -- not that i presume to insinuate however that some people may not think you perfection already -- but hush -- not a word if you please,1,1,0.7662962710359992
when i got to donwell said he knightley could not be found very odd very unaccountable after the note i sent him this morning and the message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one,1,1,0.8952187855091066
donwell cried his wife -- my dear mr e you have not been to donwell -- you mean the crown you come from the meeting at the crown,1,1,0.7793776881941696
emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary indeed and that she had not a syllable to say for him,1,1,0.911047310849067
i cannot imagine said mrs elton feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of all people in the world the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten -- my dear mr e he must have left a message for you i am sure he must -- not even knightley could be so very eccentric -- and his servants forgot it depend upon it that was the case and very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all i have often observed extremely awkward and remiss -- i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration and as for mrs hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed -- she promised wright a receipt and never sent it,1,1,0.987475715425099
she was pleased on taking leave to find miss fairfax determined to attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of to say,1,1,0.9773985890822254
you are very kind but i know what my manners were to you -- so cold and artificial -- i had always a part to act -- it was a life of deceit -- i know that i must have disgusted you,1,1,0.6409547457760493
and the next news i suppose will be that we are to lose you -- just as i begin to know you,1,1,0.5578489974883588
oh as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs campbell,1,1,0.8538921096861211
poor child cried emma at that rate what will become of her,1,1,0.7656714097722346
emma laughed and replied but i had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it,1,1,0.8517486695570793
what an amiable creature i was -- no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance,1,1,0.7187021804545651
mr knightley ' -- you always called me mr knightley ' and from habit it has not so very formal a sound -- and yet it is formal i want you to call me something else but i do not know what,1,1,0.8055166221185335
emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with harriet smith but it was too tender a subject -- she could not enter on it -- harriet was very seldom mentioned between them this on his side might merely proceed from her not being thought of but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy and a suspicion from some appearances that their friendship were declining she was aware herself that parting under any other circumstances they certainly should have corresponded more and that her intelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did on isabella's letters he might observe that it was so the pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him was very little inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy,1,1,0.9982419084581052
it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage emma accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned,1,1,0.8552469392064529
if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying he had no idea of me he seems perfectly unprepared for that,1,1,0.7872800138501782
poor man -- it was at first a considerable shock to him and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it she was reminded more than once of having always said she would never marry and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single and told of poor isabella and poor miss taylor -- but it would not do emma hung about him affectionately and smiled and said it must be so and that he must not class her with isabella and mrs weston whose marriages taking them from hartfield had indeed made a melancholy change but she was not going from hartfield she should be always there she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having mr knightley always at hand when he were once got used to the idea -- did he not love mr knightley very much -- he would not deny that he did she was sure -- whom did he ever want to consult on business but mr knightley -- who was so useful to him who so ready to write his letters who so glad to assist him -- who so cheerful so attentive so attached to him -- would not he like to have him always on the spot -- yes that was all very true mr knightley could not be there too often he should be glad to see him every day -- but they did see him every day as it was -- why could not they go on as they had done,1,1,0.9967931388398723
mrs weston with her baby on her knee indulging in such reflections as these was one of the happiest women in the world if any thing could increase her delight it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps,1,1,0.8538402328048084
time passed on a few more to-morrows and the party from london would be arriving it was an alarming change and emma was thinking of it one morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her when mr knightley came in and distressing thoughts were put by after the first chat of pleasure he was silent and then in a graver tone began with,1,1,0.9570560118599972
i am afraid said he composing his features i am very much afraid my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it,1,1,0.7375411359498873
indeed but why so -- i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too,1,1,0.6971149830234132
she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement,1,1,0.5415053632059692
you like it my emma as little as i feared -- i wish our opinions were the same but in time they will time you may be sure will make one or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile we need not talk much on the subject,1,1,0.8138068827561675
good god she cried -- well -- then having recourse to her workbasket in excuse for leaning down her face and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing she added well now tell me every thing make this intelligible to me how where when -- let me know it all i never was more surprized -- but it does not make me unhappy i assure you -- how -- how has it been possible,1,1,0.8710195902559753
he stopped -- emma dared not attempt any immediate reply to speak she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness she must wait a moment or he would think her mad her silence disturbed him and after observing her a little while he added,1,1,0.9674638278556654
you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match i think harriet is doing extremely well her connexions may be worse than his in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me how peculiarly unprepared i was -- for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him much more than she was before,1,1,0.9844261149767086
oh i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with any other and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr martin and harriet now are,1,1,0.9000627512666872
i am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity nothing doubtful in the words he used and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do he knew of no one but mrs goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends could i mention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs goddard i assured him that i could not then he said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day,1,1,0.9695624677557034
i am perfectly satisfied replied emma with the brightest smiles and most sincerely wish them happy,1,1,0.9215433470687117
me cried emma shaking her head -- ah poor harriet,1,1,0.8607624016958889
their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father she was not sorry she wanted to be alone her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her to be collected she was in dancing singing exclaiming spirits and till she had moved about and talked to herself and laughed and reflected she could be fit for nothing rational,1,1,0.9564988796188938
the joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of harriet's welfare she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security -- what had she to wish for nothing but to grow more worthy of him whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own nothing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future,1,1,0.9546081055161978
but his spirits were soon rising again and with laughing eyes after mentioning the expected return of the campbells he named the name of dixon -- emma blushed and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing,1,1,0.9184191542092168
ah by the bye then sinking his voice and looking demure for the moment -- i hope mr knightley is well he paused -- she coloured and laughed -- i know you saw my letter and think you may remember my wish in your favour let me return your congratulations -- i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction -- he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise,1,1,0.936441261998454
emma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own jane and his next words were,1,1,0.9268910833341059
not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth i am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us all in -- perhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell you the truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation i think there is a little likeness between us,1,1,0.836331237346302
if emma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for harriet a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to mr knightley and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty a very few days brought the party from london and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was -- that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr knightley and was now forming all her views of happiness,1,1,0.9983249488005922
before the end of september emma attended harriet to church and saw her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction as no remembrances even connected with mr elton as he stood before them could impair -- perhaps indeed at that time she scarcely saw mr elton but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself -- robert martin and harriet smith the latest couple engaged of the three were the first to be married,1,1,0.9938566053630237
the intermediate month was the one fixed on as far as they dared by emma and mr knightley -- they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield to allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside which was the plan -- john and isabella and every other friend were agreed in approving it but mr woodhouse -- how was mr woodhouse to be induced to consent -- he who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event,1,1,0.9965514501461232
in this state of suspense they were befriended not by any sudden illumination of mr woodhouse's mind or any wonderful change of his nervous system but by the operation of the same system in another way -- mrs weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys -- evidently by the ingenuity of man other poultry-yards in the neighbourhood also suffered -- pilfering was housebreaking to mr woodhouse's fears -- he was very uneasy and but for the sense of his son-in-law's protection would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life the strength resolution and presence of mind of the mr knightleys commanded his fullest dependence while either of them protected him and his hartfield was safe -- but mr john knightley must be in london again by the end of the first week in november,1,1,0.9672333290937458
the result of this distress was that with a much more voluntary cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment she was able to fix her wedding-day -- and mr elton was called on within a month from the marriage of mr and mrs robert martin to join the hands of mr knightley and miss woodhouse,1,1,0.9958531750181514
precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's hands but sir walter had improved it by adding for the information of himself and his family these words after the date of mary's birth -- married december 16 1810 charles son and heir of charles musgrove esq of uppercross in the county of somerset and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife,1,1,0.9080283273128482
heir presumptive william walter elliot esq great grandson of the second sir walter,1,1,0.8731027401810824
to lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter favourite and friend lady russell loved them all but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again,1,1,0.9712297799842254
elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was for thirteen years had she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country thirteen winters' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her father for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the great world she had the remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever but she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth but now she liked it not always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister made the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes and pushed it away,1,1,0.9834418780391645
she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be in the event of her having no brother the future baronet meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should he had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliot's death sir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth and in one of their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom mr elliot had been forced into the introduction,1,1,0.9867642952819037
mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold or his views on sir walter would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted,1,1,0.950089052520509
sir walter only nodded but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room he observed sarcastically --,1,1,0.6426876078695544
yes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds of objection to it first as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old sooner than any other man i have observed it all my life a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in any other line one day last spring in town i was in company with two men striking instances of what i am talking of lord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate without bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives and a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorable-looking personage you can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged to the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side and nothing but a dab of powder at top in the name of heaven who is that old fellow ' said i to a friend of mine who was standing near sir basil morley old fellow ' cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin what do you take his age to be ' sixty ' said i or perhaps sixty-two ' forty ' replied sir basil forty and no more ' picture to yourselves my amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do but to a degree i know it is the same with them all they are all knocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather till they are not fit to be seen it is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once before they reach admiral baldwin's age,1,0,0.32962228687924067
and who is admiral croft was sir walter's cold suspicious inquiry,1,1,0.8670302456417498
mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all the circumstances of the admiral's family which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant he was a married man and without children the very state to be wished for a house was never taken good care of mr shepherd observed without a lady he did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady as where there were many children a lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture in the world he had seen mrs croft too she was at taunton with the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over,1,1,0.9854283311022912
and a very well-spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be continued he asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs croft's brother,1,1,0.9661010063531291
mr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had such an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said with a gentle sigh a few months more and he perhaps may be walking here,1,1,0.952679790241332
such opposition as these feelings produced was more than anne could combat young and gentle as she was it might yet have been possible to withstand her father's ill-will though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister but lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not with such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner be continually advising her in vain she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing indiscreet improper hardly capable of success and not deserving it but it was not a merely selfish caution under which she acted in putting an end to it had she not imagined herself consulting his good even more than her own she could hardly have given him up the belief of being prudent and self-denying principally for his advantage was her chief consolation under the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation was required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions on his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment he had left the country in consequence,1,1,0.9969138508741955
they knew not each other's opinion either its constancy or its change on the one leading point of anne's conduct for the subject was never alluded to but anne at seven-and-twenty thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen she did not blame lady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her but she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances to apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home and every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears delays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it and this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs without reference to the actual results of their case which as it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on all his sanguine expectations all his confidence had been justified his genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path he had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ and all that he had told her would follow had taken place he had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank and must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority but she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy she had no reason to believe him married,1,1,0.9972696876753276
the house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts were approved terms time every thing and every body was right and mr shepherd's clerks were set to work without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that this indenture sheweth,1,1,0.855600373659027
sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be the best-looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife as they drove back through the park i thought we should soon come to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton the baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to be no harm in him reciprocal compliments which would have been esteemed about equal,1,1,0.9188038025527328
the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walter proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement,1,1,0.9531055735883881
i am sorry to find you unwell replied anne you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday,1,1,0.864188548025921
oh well and after a moment's pause but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday,1,0,0.49372338837892077
nothing remarkable one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one's own mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were so crowded they are both so very large and take up so much room and mr musgrove always sits forward so there was i crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louise and i think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it,1,1,0.9042289653796697
a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on anne's side produced nearly a cure on mary's she could soon sit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner-time then forgetting to think of it she was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay then she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough to propose a little walk,1,1,0.901720372332338
where shall we go said she when they were ready i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you,1,0,0.4309056891573
she could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell,1,1,0.9402410447478677
the mr musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroy their own horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping neighbours dress dancing and music she acknowledged it to be very fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination her memory and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible,1,1,0.9452708484822409
charles musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time anne could believe with lady russell that a more equal match might have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness rationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits as it was he did nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwise trifled away without benefit from books or anything else he had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by his wife's occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to anne's admiration and upon the whole though there was very often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share than she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass for a happy couple they were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father but here as on most topics he had the superiority for while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made he always contended for his father's having many other uses for his money and a right to spend it as he liked,1,1,0.9966821741776978
she had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed and the re-perusal of these letters after so long an interval her poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten had affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death mr musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and when they reached the cottage they were evidently in want first of being listened to anew on this subject and afterwards of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them,1,1,0.9660948991982043
her brother's return was the first comfort he could take best care of his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary till he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were the worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where but now the collar-bone was soon replaced and though mr robinson felt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind and then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew's state as to give the information of captain wentworth's visit staying five minutes behind their father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance who had been at all a favourite before how glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma's farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow -- actually on the morrow and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought and in short he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace that they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him and off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently more full of captain wentworth than of little charles,1,1,0.9895070475060876
the child had a good night and was going on well the next day it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm and charles musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity for longer confinement the child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do this was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him who could be of no use at home to shut himself up his father very much wished him to meet captain wentworth and there being no sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his making a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting of his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house,1,1,0.9563892843986647
nothing can be going on better than the child said he so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use anne will send for me if anything is the matter,1,1,0.7552505310267794
yes you see his papa can and why should not i jemima is so careful and she could send us word every hour how he was i really think charles might as well have told his father we would all come i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to-day,1,1,0.8953798667769889
anne understood it he wished to avoid seeing her he had inquired after her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet,1,1,0.9706631553124908
mary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him while a thousand feelings rushed on anne of which this was the most consoling that it would soon be over and it was soon over in two minutes after charles's preparation the others appeared they were in the drawing-room her eye half met captain wentworth's a bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to mary said all that was right said something to the miss musgroves enough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of persons and voices but a few minutes ended it charles shewed himself at the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone the miss musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen the room was cleared and anne might finish her breakfast as she could,1,1,0.9895541978776065
he had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation of curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again her power with him was gone for ever,1,1,0.9108951450347791
it was now his object to marry he was rich and being turned on shore fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted actually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow he had a heart for either of the miss musgroves if they could catch it a heart in short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way excepting anne elliot this was his only secret exception when he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions --,1,1,0.9470146279498108
whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each they could not but be reverted to the year of their engagement could not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth his profession qualified him his disposition lead him to talk and that was in the year six that happened before i went to sea in the year six occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together and though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke anne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself there must be the same immediate association of thought though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain,1,1,0.9621625873159746
they had no conversation together no intercourse but what the commonest civility required once so much to each other now nothing there had been a time when of all the large party now filling the drawing-room at uppercross they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another with the exception perhaps of admiral and mrs croft who seemed particularly attached and happy anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples there could have been no two hearts so open no tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved now they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they could never become acquainted it was a perpetual estrangement,1,1,0.9631311963361344
when she could let her attention take its natural course again she found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list their own navy list the first that had ever been at uppercross and sitting down together to pore over it with the professed view of finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded,1,1,0.8979433234501007
and so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voice as if thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there he met with our poor boy charles my dear beckoning him to her do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother i always forgot,1,1,0.9000195351766936
oh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend,1,1,0.9661562872721224
if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters,1,1,0.8611623404460339
but if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry towards them it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all one's efforts and all one's sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high and this is what i do i hate to hear of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it,1,1,0.7108852003707131
anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything,1,1,0.7172354200823455
charles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable pleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth's introduction he was in orders and having a curacy in the neighbourhood where residence was not required lived at his father's house only two miles from uppercross a short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners and of seeing captain wentworth,1,1,0.9973861864591923
you know said she i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made she has no right to throw herself away i do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them and pray who is charles hayter nothing but a country curate a most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross,1,1,0.9905551242641929
a dinner at mr musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by anne but she had staid at home under the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return of indisposition in little charles she had thought only of avoiding captain wentworth but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening,1,1,0.9831428415076188
one morning very soon after the dinner at the musgroves at which anne had not been present captain wentworth walked into the drawing-room at the cottage where were only herself and the little invalid charles who was lying on the sofa,1,1,0.983801325823542
another minute brought another addition the younger boy a remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance among them and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away,1,1,0.5317285050162712
there being nothing to eat he could only have some play and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother he began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that busy as she was about charles she could not shake him off she spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain once she did contrive to push him away but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly,1,1,0.832401400366196
it was a very fine november day and the miss musgroves came through the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say that they were going to take a long walk and therefore concluded mary could not like to go with them and when mary immediately replied with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker oh yes i should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk anne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely what they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce of everything being to be communicated and everything being to be done together however undesired and inconvenient she tried to dissuade mary from going but in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept the miss musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise as she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening the interference in any plan of their own,1,1,0.9948293960226126
i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk said mary as she went up stairs everybody is always supposing that i am not a good walker and yet they would not have been pleased if we had refused to join them when people come in this manner on purpose to ask us how can one say no,1,1,0.8135036145133346
anne really tired herself was glad to sit down and she very soon heard captain wentworth and louisa in the hedge-row behind her as if making their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the centre they were speaking as they drew near louisa's voice was the first distinguished she seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech what anne first heard was --,1,1,0.8327207695207832
i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time but i believe about a year before he married mary i wish she had accepted him we should all have liked her a great deal better and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend lady russell's doing that she did not they think charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell and that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him,1,1,0.9963138546540831
charles and henrietta returned bringing as may be conjectured charles hayter with them the minutiae of the business anne could not attempt to understand even captain wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman's side and a relenting on the lady's and that they were now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt henrietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleased -- charles hayter exceedingly happy and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross,1,1,0.9940098424774685
but by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dung-cart and anne with some amusement at their style of driving which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage,1,1,0.8583803501999834
the time now approached for lady russell's return the day was even fixed and anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled was looking forward to an early removal to kellynch and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it,1,1,0.9840832210615283
it would place her in the same village with captain wentworth within half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church and there must be intercourse between the two families this was against her but on the other hand he spent so much of his time at uppercross that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind than as going towards him and upon the whole she believed she must on this interesting question be the gainer almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society in leaving poor mary for lady russell,1,1,0.9703620574463389
the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night but to this mr musgrove for the sake of his horses would not consent and when it came to be rationally considered a day in the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place after deducting seven hours as the nature of the country required for going and returning they were consequently to stay the night there and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner this was felt to be a considerable amendment and though they all met at the great house at rather an early breakfast hour and set off very punctually it was so much past noon before the two carriages mr musgrove's coach containing the four ladies and charles's curricle in which he drove captain wentworth were descending the long hill into lyme and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them before the light and warmth of the day were gone,1,1,0.9613131562032591
there was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon so unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations and dinners of formality and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers these would have been all my friends was her thought and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness,1,1,0.987118944622747
anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house and louisa by whom she found herself walking burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness their uprightness protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england that they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be respected and loved,1,1,0.9540241739900711
oh yes -- i am quite convinced that with very few exceptions the sea-air always does good there can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to dr shirley after his illness last spring twelve-month he declares himself that coming to lyme for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took and that being by the sea always makes him feel young again now i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely and fix at lyme do not you anne do not you agree with me that it is the best thing he could do both for himself and mrs shirley she has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which would make it cheerful for her and i am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand in case of his having another seizure indeed i think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley who have been doing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place like uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut out from all the world i wish his friends would propose it to him i really think they ought and as to procuring a dispensation there could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions over-scrupulous i must say do not you think anne it is being over-scrupulous do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties which may be just as well performed by another person and at lyme too only seventeen miles off he would be near enough to hear if people thought there was anything to complain of,1,1,0.9817125490292833
when they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentleman at the same moment preparing to come down politely drew back and stopped to give them way they ascended and passed him and as they passed anne's face caught his eye and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of she was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye which it had also produced it was evident that the gentleman completely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly captain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it he gave her a momentary glance a glance of brightness which seemed to say that man is struck with you and even i at this moment see something like anne elliot again,1,1,0.9462199095290471
they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage almost the first they had heard since entering lyme drew half the party to the window it was a gentleman's carriage a curricle but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door somebody must be going away it was driven by a servant in mourning,1,1,0.7562412949384921
ah cried captain wentworth instantly and with half a glance at anne it is the very man we passed,1,1,0.9369164859144102
yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night from sidmouth dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were at dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath and london,1,1,0.8956812703065792
bless me cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed charles anne must not it in mourning you see just as our mr elliot must be how very extraordinary in the very same inn with us anne must not it be our mr elliot my father's next heir pray sir turning to the waiter did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family,1,1,0.9804119711395346
putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together said captain wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin,1,1,0.9473326237542568
when she could command mary's attention anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and mr elliot had not for many years been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable,1,1,0.9873692973027269
at the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense she would not upon any account mention her having met with him the second time luckily mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk but she would have felt quite ill-used by anne's having actually run against him in the passage and received his very polite excuses while she had never been near him at all no that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret,1,1,0.981905089678193
breakfast had not been long over when they were joined by captain and mrs harville and captain benwick with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about lyme they ought to be setting off for uppercross by one and in the mean while were to be all together and out of doors as long as they could,1,1,0.9515935697346319
anne found captain benwick getting near her as soon as they were all fairly in the street their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again and they walked together some time talking as before of mr scott and lord byron and still as unable as before and as unable as any other two readers to think exactly alike of the merits of either till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead of captain benwick she had captain harville by her side,1,1,0.9816670133024297
there was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant for the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight excepting louisa she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth in all their walks he had had to jump her from the stiles the sensation was delightful to her the hardness of the pavement for her feet made him less willing upon the present occasion he did it however she was safely down and instantly to show her enjoyment ran up the steps to be jumped down again he advised her against it thought the jar too great but no he reasoned and talked in vain she smiled and said i am determined i will he put out his hands she was too precipitate by half a second she fell on the pavement on the lower cobb and was taken up lifeless there was no wound no blood no visible bruise but her eyes were closed she breathed not her face was like death the horror of the moment to all who stood around,1,1,0.5677103566533577
is there no one to help me were the first words which burst from captain wentworth in a tone of despair and as if all his own strength were gone,1,1,0.6750351948908567
had not she better be carried to the inn yes i am sure carry her gently to the inn,1,1,0.6078811656268032
louisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again without apparent consciousness this had been a proof of life however of service to her sister and henrietta though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with louisa was kept by the agitation of hope and fear from a return of her own insensibility mary too was growing calmer,1,1,0.9852978024721346
the surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible they were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopeless the head had received a severe contusion but he had seen greater injuries recovered from he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfully,1,1,0.7217388604332952
that he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not say a few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of most and the ecstasy of such a reprieve the rejoicing deep and silent after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered may be conceived,1,1,0.786746208875789
charles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away he would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville but as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would so far it was decided and henrietta at first declared the same she however was soon persuaded to think differently the usefulness of her staying she who had not been able to remain in louisa's room or to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless she was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good yet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the thought of her father and mother she gave it up she consented she was anxious to be at home,1,1,0.9974105953612623
she paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of the other two warmly agreed with what he said and she then appeared,1,1,0.8937347010254754
they had an early account from lyme the next morning louisa was much the same no symptoms worse than before had appeared charles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later and more particular account he was tolerably cheerful a speedy cure must not be hoped but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted in speaking of the harvilles he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness especially of mrs harville's exertions as a nurse she really left nothing for mary to do he and mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night mary had been hysterical again this morning when he came away she was going to walk out with captain benwick which he hoped would do her good he almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before but the truth was that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do,1,1,0.9982269192773477
if louisa recovered it would all be well again more than former happiness would be restored there could not be a doubt to her mind there was none of what would follow her recovery a few months hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by her silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happy and gay all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love all that was most unlike anne elliot,1,1,0.9603740152403206
there was some anxiety mixed with lady russell's joy in meeting her she knew who had been frequenting uppercross but happily either anne was improved in plumpness and looks or lady russell fancied her so and anne in receiving her compliments on the occasion had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty,1,1,0.9861193247510105
when they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental change the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch and which she had felt slighted and been compelled to smother among the musgroves were now become but of secondary interest she had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place which had been taken and her regret that mrs clay should still be with them anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove and all her acquaintance there how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick than her own father's house in camden place or her own sister's intimacy with mrs clay she was actually forced to exert herself to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude on topics which had by nature the first claim on her,1,1,0.9993534469129677
lady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contempt that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwards be charmed by a louisa musgrove,1,1,0.9738229408184116
in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself these rooms ought to belong only to us oh how fallen in their destination how unworthily occupied an ancient family to be so driven away strangers filling their place no except when she thought of her mother and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description to heave,1,1,0.8548331103605541
anne finding she might decline it did so very gratefully,1,1,0.883204732749153
they had been all in lodgings together mrs musgrove had got mrs harville's children away as much as she could every possible supply from uppercross had been furnished to lighten the inconvenience to the harvilles while the harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day and in short it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable,1,1,0.986412396959583
but mary did not give into it very graciously whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an elliot or from not wanting to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself must be left to be guessed anne's good-will however was not to be lessened by what she heard she boldly acknowledged herself flattered and continued her enquiries,1,1,0.9959806564513767
and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you ma'am said charles though he had not nerves for coming away with us and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it i told him the distance and the road and i told him of the church's being so very well worth seeing for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon so i give you notice lady russell,1,1,0.9614245204014632
any acquaintance of anne's will always be welcome to me was lady russell's kind answer,1,1,0.9738018805576676
well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see captain benwick,1,1,0.938241872170594
you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you ma'am he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived he has walked with me sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word he is not at all a well-bred young man i am sure you will not like him,1,1,0.7516249878668374
lady russell could not help laughing upon my word said she i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact as i may call myself i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions i wish he may be induced to call here and when he does mary you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined not to judge him beforehand,1,1,0.9642649029916969
sir walter had taken a very good house in camden place a lofty dignified situation such as becomes a man of consequence and both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction,1,1,0.9394267080870781
mrs clay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for they were evidently in excellent spirits and she was soon to listen to the causes they had no inclination to listen to her after laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay they had only a few faint enquiries to make before the talk must be all their own uppercross excited no interest kellynch very little it was all bath,1,1,0.9945972472727679
but this was not all which they had to make them happy they had mr elliot too anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him he had been in bath about a fortnight he had passed through bath in november in his way to london when the intelligence of sir walter's being settled there had of course reached him though only twenty-four hours in the place but he had not been able to avail himself of it but he had now been a fortnight in bath and his first object on arriving had been to leave his card in camden place following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet and when they did meet by such great openness of conduct such readiness to apologize for the past such solicitude to be received as a relation again that their former good understanding was completely re-established,1,1,0.9939684629093624
mr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they gave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof of cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in camden place,1,1,0.9669157209772082
mr elliot and his friends in marlborough buildings were talked of the whole evening colonel wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them and mr elliot so anxious that he should and there was a mrs wallis at present known only to them by description as she was in daily expectation of her confinement but mr elliot spoke of her as a most charming woman quite worthy of being known in camden place and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted sir walter thought much of mrs wallis she was said to be an excessively pretty woman beautiful he longed to see her he hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets the worst of bath was the number of its plain women he did not mean to say that there were no pretty women but the number of the plain was out of all proportion he had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome face would be followed by thirty or five-and-thirty frights and once as he had stood in a shop on bond street he had counted eighty-seven women go by one after another without there being a tolerable face among them it had been a frosty morning to be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of but still there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath and as for the men they were infinitely worse such scarecrows as the streets were full of it was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced he had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with colonel wallis who was a fine military figure though sandy-haired without observing that every woman's eye was upon him every woman's eye was sure to be upon colonel wallis modest sir walter he was not allowed to escape however his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel wallis's companion might have as good a figure as colonel wallis and certainly was not sandy-haired,1,1,0.9758955589375081
his enquiries however produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there soon after his leaving the place having alluded to an accident he must hear the whole when he questioned sir walter and elizabeth began to question also but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt she could only compare mr elliot to lady russell in the wish of really comprehending what had passed and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it,1,1,0.9871702030390999
anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in camden place could have passed so well,1,1,0.9553180307353826
he spoke and looked so much in earnest that anne was not surprised to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself her countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties and promise to stay,1,1,0.9822594250257468
in the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to be alone together he began to compliment her on her improved looks he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skin her complexion greatly improved clearer fresher had she been using any thing in particular no nothing merely gowland he supposed no nothing at all ha he was surprised at that and added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are you cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowland the constant use of gowland during the spring months mrs clay has been using it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her you see how it has carried away her freckles,1,1,0.9594822627842144
if elizabeth could but have heard this such personal praise might have struck her especially as it did not appear to anne that the freckles were at all lessened but everything must take its chance the evil of a marriage would be much diminished if elizabeth were also to marry as for herself she might always command a home with lady russell,1,1,0.9781650530331
my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever well-informed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what i call good company,1,1,0.860158236007524
well said anne i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place,1,1,0.6954224329713307
mrs clay who had been present while all this passed now thought it advisable to leave the room and anne could have said much and did long to say a little in defence of her friend's not very dissimilar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her she made no reply she left it to himself to recollect that mrs smith was not the only widow in bath between thirty and forty with little to live on and no surname of dignity,1,1,0.9900606533651045
though they had now been acquainted a month she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character that he was a sensible man an agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all clear enough he certainly knew what was right nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct she distrusted the past if not the present the names which occasionally dropt of former associates the allusions to former practices and pursuits suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been she saw that there had been bad habits that sunday travelling had been a common thing that there had been a period of his life and probably not a short one when he had been at least careless in all serious matters and though he might now think very differently who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever cautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair character how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed,1,1,0.9650999630934991
i am sorry to say that i am very far from well and jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much about i dare say i shall catch it and my sore-throats you know are always worse than anybody's,1,1,0.6036519865650091
so ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an envelope containing nearly as much more,1,1,0.5403070162313978
none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together i am going home,1,0,0.39430316867443527
well she is to marry him nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they should wait for,1,1,0.8152797352098431
certainly but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing in captain wentworth's manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill-used by his friend which might appear you know without its being absolutely said i should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick should be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort,1,1,0.9729252239856487
it was fixed accordingly that mrs clay should be of the party in the carriage and they had just reached this point when anne as she sat near the window descried most decidedly and distinctly captain wentworth walking down the street,1,1,0.9725359126655437
he spoke to her and then turned away the character of his manner was embarrassment she could not have called it either cold or friendly or anything so certainly as embarrassed,1,1,0.6800680312381515
lady dalrymple's carriage for which miss elliot was growing very impatient now drew up the servant came in to announce it it was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay and a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey miss elliot at last miss elliot and her friend unattended but by the servant for there was no cousin returned were walking off and captain wentworth watching them turned again to anne and by manner rather than words was offering his services to her,1,1,0.9888875378386621
and so do i no comparison but the men are all wild after miss elliot anne is too delicate for them,1,1,0.8760435522522053
another circumstance very essential for her to know was how long he meant to be in bath he had not mentioned it or she could not recollect it he might be only passing through but it was more probable that he should be come to stay in that case so liable as every body was to meet every body in bath lady russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere would she recollect him how would it all be,1,1,0.9650022762831829
the following morning anne was out with her friend and for the first hour in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain but at last in returning down pulteney street she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street there were many other men about him many groups walking the same way but there was no mistaking him she looked instinctively at lady russell but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself no it was not to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite she looked at her however from time to time anxiously and when the moment approached which must point him out though not daring to look again for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen she was yet perfectly conscious of lady russell's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him -- of her being in short intently observing him she could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russell's mind the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him and in foreign climes and in active service too without robbing him of one personal grace,1,1,0.9377931300844967
by all means said she only tell me all about it when you do come who is your party,1,1,0.5167854634908499
it was a frightful hour said he a frightful day and he passed his hand across his eyes as if the remembrance were still too painful but in a moment half smiling again added the day has produced some effects however has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful when you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery,1,1,0.8291907339803279
as she ceased the entrance door opened again and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting lady dalrymple lady dalrymple was the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her lady dalrymple and miss carteret escorted by mr elliot and colonel wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant advanced into the room the others joined them and it was a group in which anne found herself also necessarily included she was divided from captain wentworth their interesting almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on she had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelings towards louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think of and she gave herself up to the demands of the party to the needful civilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensations she was in good humour with all she had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all and to pity every one as being less happy than herself,1,1,0.9964546545257638
the party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches anne was among those on the foremost and mr elliot had manoeuvred so well with the assistance of his friend colonel wallis as to have a seat by her miss elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object of colonel wallis's gallantry was quite contented,1,1,0.9777974951275322
before sir walter had reached this point anne's eyes had caught the right direction and distinguished captain wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance as her eyes fell on him his seemed to be withdrawn from her it had that appearance it seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as she dared observe he did not look again but the performance was recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward,1,1,0.9049544524431902
is not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging,1,1,0.7875529998121019
anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to mrs smith meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call for to avoid mr elliot was almost a first object,1,1,0.9960934489827248
prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy could never have passed along the streets of bath than anne was sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings it was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way,1,1,0.5528386877372644
an account of the concert was immediately claimed and anne's recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it all that she could tell she told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith who had already heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath was well know by name to mrs smith,1,1,0.9906884884500079
oh you saw enough for your own amusement i can understand there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd and this you had you were a large party in yourselves and you wanted nothing beyond,1,1,0.6688446246580821
no no you were better employed you need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening i see it in your eye i perfectly see how the hours passed that you had always something agreeable to listen to in the intervals of the concert it was conversation,1,1,0.8699777512244065
anne half smiled and said do you see that in my eye,1,1,0.6381268586942984
mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said --,1,1,0.8793870172294529
my dear mrs smith mr elliot's wife has not been dead much above half a year he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one,1,1,0.9678798403781128
i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years,1,1,0.9231488724728478
my expressions startle you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together we were principally in town living in very good style he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman he had always a home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse was open to him i know that he often assisted him,1,1,0.9805511104256297
mr elliot replied mrs smith at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me the whole story he had no concealments with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other,1,1,0.989940994382544
mrs smith hesitated a little here oh those things are too common when one lives in the world a man or woman's marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought i was very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of conduct we lived for enjoyment i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing to do the best for himself ' passed as a duty,1,1,0.9336781407172672
but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet,1,1,0.573242538413311
this was the letter directed to charles smith esq tunbridge wells and dated from london as far back as july 1803 --,1,1,0.906711773032736
the language i know is highly disrespectful though i have forgot the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning but it shows you the man mark his professions to my poor husband can any thing be stronger,1,1,0.5746397973402313
well continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister's friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter's acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger,1,1,0.9962433760045265
this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re-admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do,1,1,0.9973245839855092
the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends and to prove that mr elliot's had better not be tried but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known with a confidence in mr elliot's regard more creditable to his feelings than his judgement mr smith had appointed him the executor of his will but mr elliot would not act and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to without corresponding indignation,1,1,0.9854389739066598
it was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne's good offices with mr elliot she had previously in the anticipation of their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature since he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurred that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne's feelings as far as the observances due to mr elliot's character would allow when anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything and while it took from her the new-formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way,1,1,0.997238315376553
it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference which carried them through the greater part of the morning was that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to mrs smith in which his conduct was involved,1,1,0.9728225066615614
she found on reaching home that she had as she intended escaped seeing mr elliot that he had called and paid them a long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself and felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening,1,1,0.9670886712677693
i had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints so mrs clay says at least,1,1,0.9198172161132819
indeed i do say it i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation poor man i was really in pain for him for your hard-hearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty,1,1,0.7712483982306761
well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him i did invite him you know i sent him away with smiles when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park for the whole day to-morrow i had compassion on him,1,1,0.7859056993945167
she had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath the next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater part of two days he was invited again to camden place the very evening of his return but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain it was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort it was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and elizabeth to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them mrs clay's selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his and anne would have compounded for the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of mr elliot's subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it,1,1,0.9848889949778814
and mine added sir walter kindest regards and you may say that i mean to call upon her soon make a civil message but i shall only leave my card morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately,1,1,0.8447945881111755
surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance but anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon as it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived with an views of accommodation in that house sir walter and elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well they were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove and were at the white hart so much was pretty soon understood but till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into the other drawing-room and regaling themselves with her admiration anne could not draw upon charles's brain for a regular history of their coming or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of,1,1,0.9875228441874566
she then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove henrietta and captain harville beside their two selves he gave her a very plain intelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding the scheme had received its first impulse by captain harville's wanting to come to bath on business he had begun to talk of it a week ago and by way of doing something as shooting was over charles had proposed coming with him and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much as an advantage to her husband but mary could not bear to be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense or at an end but then it had been taken up by his father and mother his mother had some old friends in bath whom she wanted to see it was thought a good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes for herself and her sister and in short it ended in being his mother's party that everything might be comfortable and easy to captain harville and he and mary were included in it by way of general convenience they had arrived late the night before mrs harville her children and captain benwick remained with mr musgrove and louisa at uppercross,1,1,0.9983719884829545
oh yes my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer but he has no other fault to find money you know coming down with money -- two daughters at once -- it cannot be a very agreeable operation and it streightens him as to many things however i do not mean to say they have not a right to it it is very fit they should have daughters' shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind liberal father to me mary does not above half like henrietta's match she never did you know but she does not do him justice nor think enough about winthrop i cannot make her attend to the value of the property it is a very fair match as times go and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now,1,1,0.966868090923502
to pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment anne did move quietly to the window she was just in time to ascertain that it really was mr elliot which she had never believed before he disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly off on the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliot certainly he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all or i may be mistaken i might not attend and walked back to her chair recomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well,1,1,0.9786125924376019
mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play if henrietta and all the others liked it when mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming --,1,1,0.9434569066275492
no i did not promise i only smirked and bowed and said the word happy ' there was no promise,1,0,0.47676615512442044
we had better put it off charles you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday it would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her father's and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play if miss anne could not be with us,1,1,0.9744397743188737
anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying --,1,1,0.9792145320693214
oh no the usual character of them has nothing for me i am no card-player,1,1,0.7170418258451995
they were obliged to move anne talked of being perfectly ready and tried to look it but she felt that could henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair in preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own sensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection wherewith to pity her,1,1,0.9916542823570665
anne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt and turned away that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her,1,0,0.45496760350462667
promising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow's party the frequent enumeration of the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in bath while harassing herself with the never-ending question of whether captain wentworth would come or not they were reckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together she generally thought he would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings,1,1,0.973072805725182
oh dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable to let her finish her speech there is nothing i so abominate for young people as a long engagement it is what i always protested against for my children it is all very well i used to say for young people to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months or even in twelve but a long engagement --,1,1,0.9720192844711009
the two ladies continued to talk to re-urge the same admitted truths and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation but anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear her mind was in confusion,1,1,0.793413064126786
captain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it now left his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him though it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood he looked at her with a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed come to me i have something to say and the unaffected easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was strongly enforced the invitation she roused herself and went to him the window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer to captain wentworth's table not very near as she joined him captain harville's countenance re-assumed the serious thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character,1,1,0.9614896889885601
yes and you may guess who it is for but in a deep tone it was not done for her miss elliot do you remember our walking together at lyme and grieving for him i little thought then -- but no matter this was drawn at the cape he met with a clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another it was a commission to me but who else was there to employ i hope i can allow for him i am not sorry indeed to make it over to another he undertakes it looking towards captain wentworth he is writing about it now and with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon,1,1,0.9330156409538799
it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved,1,1,0.6050527955308894
no no it is not man's nature i will not allow it to be more man's nature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do love or have loved i believe the reverse i believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage and riding out the heaviest weather,1,1,0.5231725971790511
there is no hurry on my side i am only ready whenever you are i am in very good anchorage here smiling at anne well supplied and want for nothing no hurry for a signal at all well miss elliot lowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose upon this point no man and woman would probably but let me observe that all histories are against you -- all stories prose and verse if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman's inconstancy songs and proverbs all talk of woman's fickleness but perhaps you will say these were all written by men,1,1,0.7569660291391868
ah cried captain harville in a tone of strong feeling if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children and watches the boat that he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again ' and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again when coming back after a twelvemonth's absence perhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself and saying they cannot be here till such a day ' but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence i speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own with emotion,1,1,0.6759037248288041
she could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart was too full her breath too much oppressed,1,1,0.7385232232339272
captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either could not or would not answer fully,1,1,0.8493197667417639
i can listen no longer in silence i must speak to you by such means as are within my reach you pierce my soul i am half agony half hope tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings are gone for ever i offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman that his love has an earlier death i have loved none but you unjust i may have been weak and resentful i have been but never inconstant you alone have brought me to bath for you alone i think and plan have you not seen this can you fail to have understood my wishes i had not waited even these ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must have penetrated mine i can hardly write i am every instant hearing something which overpowers me you sink your voice but i can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others too good too excellent creature you do us justice indeed you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men believe it to be most fervent most undeviating in f w,1,1,0.8421135212380353
but the chair would never do worse than all to lose the possibility of speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet solitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him could not be borne the chair was earnestly protested against and mrs musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness having assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall in the case that anne had not at any time lately slipped down and got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on finding her better at night,1,1,0.963335644609149
anxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said --,1,1,0.8511507298133866
anne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity it could not be very lasting however even if he did not come to camden place himself it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by captain harville another momentary vexation occurred charles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her there was no preventing him this was almost cruel but she could not be long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith's to be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling but gratitude apparent,1,1,0.9827043818469042
they were on union street when a quicker step behind a something of familiar sound gave her two moments' preparation for the sight of captain wentworth he joined them but as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked anne could command herself enough to receive that look and not repulsively the cheeks which had been pale now glowed and the movements which had hesitated were decided he walked by her side presently struck by a sudden thought charles said --,1,1,0.8428751017704829
of what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified he persisted in having loved none but her she had never been supplanted he never even believed himself to see her equal thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge that he had been constant unconsciously nay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it to be done he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only been angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been a sufferer from them her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross had he learnt to do her justice and only at lyme had he begun to understand himself at lyme he had received lessons of more than one sort the passing admiration of mr elliot had at least roused him and the scenes on the cobb and at captain harville's had fixed her superiority,1,1,0.9843653667858427
in his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove the attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not care for louisa though till that day till the leisure for reflection which followed it he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which louisa's could so ill bear a comparison or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own there he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind there he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost and there begun to deplore the pride the folly the madness of resentment which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way,1,1,0.9513389314244814
he had remained in shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own pride and the blunders of his own calculations till at once released from louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with benwick,1,1,0.9428493485673881
here said he ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for evil had been dreadful within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday ' and i was was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive with some degree of hope you were single it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement happened to be mine i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help often saying was this for me ',1,1,0.9188095625067756
i should have thought said anne that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this,1,1,0.9107798590147131
at last anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house could have conceived all the surprise and suspense and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last an interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity and she went to her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment,1,1,0.9351226459673928
he looked at her looked at lady russell and looking again at her replied as if in cool deliberation --,1,1,0.6831808949002637
not yet but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time i trust to being in charity with her soon but i too have been thinking over the past and a question has suggested itself whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady my own self tell me if when i returned to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you would you have answered my letter would you in short have renewed the engagement then,1,1,0.8481305751736031
the only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was lady russell anne knew that lady russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with and do justice to captain wentworth this however was what lady russell had now to do she must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each that because captain wentworth's manners had not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because mr elliot's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well-regulated mind there was nothing less for lady russell to do than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes,1,1,0.9981044593781977
why to be sure said her husband very gravely that would make great difference the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition,1,1,0.9008407888888069
edward ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address he was not handsome and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing he was too diffident to do justice to himself but when his natural shyness was overcome his behaviour gave every indication of an open affectionate heart his understanding was good and his education had given it solid improvement but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed to see him distinguished -- as -- they hardly knew what they wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other his mother wished to interest him in political concerns to get him into parliament or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day mrs john dashwood wished it likewise but in the mean while till one of these superior blessings could be attained it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche but edward had no turn for great men or barouches all his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising,1,1,0.9908100978883955
i think you will like him said elinor when you know more of him,1,1,0.6973227816754531
remember my love that you are not seventeen it is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness why should you be less fortunate than your mother in one circumstance only my marianne may your destiny be different from her's,1,1,0.8895861198485554
i am sure replied elinor with a smile that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that i do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly,1,1,0.9188042432121579
of his sense and his goodness continued elinor no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation the excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth but of his minuter propensities as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself he and i have been at times thrown a good deal together while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother i have seen a great deal of him have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste and upon the whole i venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and correct and his taste delicate and pure his abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person at first sight his address is certainly not striking and his person can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome or at least almost so what say you marianne,1,1,0.9733826687624132
elinor started at this declaration and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into in speaking of him she felt that edward stood very high in her opinion she believed the regard to be mutual but she required greater certainty of it to make marianne's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her she knew that what marianne and her mother conjectured one moment they believed the next -- that with them to wish was to hope and to hope was to expect she tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister,1,1,0.9962990565507953
i do not attempt to deny said she that i think very highly of him -- that i greatly esteem that i like him,1,1,0.7107186146103828
esteem him like him cold-hearted elinor oh worse than cold-hearted ashamed of being otherwise use those words again and i will leave the room this moment,1,1,0.8341024758172348
elinor could not help laughing excuse me said she and be assured that i meant no offence to you by speaking in so quiet a way of my own feelings believe them to be stronger than i have declared believe them in short to be such as his merit and the suspicion -- the hope of his affection for me may warrant without imprudence or folly but farther than this you must not believe i am by no means assured of his regard for me there are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful and till his sentiments are fully known you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality by believing or calling it more than it is in my heart i feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference but there are other points to be considered besides his inclination he is very far from being independent what his mother really is we cannot know but from fanny's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions we have never been disposed to think her amiable and i am very much mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank,1,1,0.9973816487852531
as a house barton cottage though small was comfortable and compact but as a cottage it was defective for the building was regular the roof was tiled the window shutters were not painted green nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles a narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind on each side of the entrance was a sitting room about sixteen feet square and beyond them were the offices and the stairs four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house it had not been built many years and was in good repair in comparison of norland it was poor and small indeed -- but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away they were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy it was very early in september the season was fine and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation,1,1,0.854408921583282
they were of course very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at barton must depend and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes lady middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty her face was handsome her figure tall and striking and her address graceful her manners had all the elegance which her husband's wanted but they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration by shewing that though perfectly well-bred she was reserved cold and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark,1,1,0.9925991511190841
barton park was about half a mile from the cottage the ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill the house was large and handsome and the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance the former was for sir john's gratification the latter for that of his lady they were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood it was necessary to the happiness of both for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments unconnected with such as society produced within a very narrow compass sir john was a sportsman lady middleton a mother he hunted and shot and she humoured her children and these were their only resources lady middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round while sir john's independent employments were in existence only half the time continual engagements at home and abroad however supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education supported the good spirits of sir john and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife,1,1,0.9938606068160035
the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at barton the miss dashwoods were young pretty and unaffected it was enough to secure his good opinion for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person the friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those whose situation might be considered in comparison with the past as unfortunate in showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart and in settling a family of females only in his cottage he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman for a sportsman though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor,1,1,0.9816376115111595
is there a felicity in the world said marianne superior to this -- margaret we will walk here at least two hours,1,1,0.8860786914607465
a gentleman carrying a gun with two pointers playing round him was passing up the hill and within a few yards of marianne when her accident happened he put down his gun and ran to her assistance she had raised herself from the ground but her foot had been twisted in her fall and she was scarcely able to stand the gentleman offered his services and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary took her up in his arms without farther delay and carried her down the hill then passing through the garden the gate of which had been left open by margaret he bore her directly into the house whither margaret was just arrived and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour,1,1,0.7903420879853299
know him to be sure i do why he is down here every year,1,1,0.5011380762394845
he is as good a sort of fellow i believe as ever lived repeated sir john i remember last christmas at a little hop at the park he danced from eight o'clock till four without once sitting down,1,1,0.6378165532005027
well marianne said elinor as soon as he had left them for one morning i think you have done pretty well you have already ascertained mr willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of importance you know what he thinks of cowper and scott you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and then you can have nothing farther to ask --,1,1,0.9784416005767368
his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment they read they talked they sang together his musical talents were considerable and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted,1,1,0.8944567946632834
colonel brandon's partiality for marianne which had so early been discovered by his friends now first became perceptible to elinor when it ceased to be noticed by them their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility elinor was obliged though unwillingly to believe that the sentiments which mrs jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction were now actually excited by her sister and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr willoughby an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of colonel brandon she saw it with concern for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty and as she could not even wish him successful she heartily wished him indifferent she liked him -- in spite of his gravity and reserve she beheld in him an object of interest his manners though serious were mild and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper sir john had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man and she regarded him with respect and compassion,1,1,0.9989856379755824
that is exactly what i think of him cried marianne,1,1,0.8301957727409626
but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and marianne will make amends for the regard of lady middleton and her mother if their praise is censure your censure may be praise for they are not more undiscerning than you are prejudiced and unjust,1,1,0.9407566935390261
when he was present she had no eyes for any one else every thing he did was right every thing he said was clever if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand if dancing formed the amusement of the night they were partners for half the time and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at but ridicule could not shame and seemed hardly to provoke them,1,1,0.9120489908748749
or rather as i believe she considers them impossible to exist,1,1,0.6428342066081708
i believe she does but how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father who had himself two wives i know not a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are by any body but herself,1,1,0.89908332901925
as elinor and marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister which in spite of all that she knew before of marianne's imprudence and want of thought surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both marianne told her with the greatest delight that willoughby had given her a horse one that he had bred himself on his estate in somersetshire and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman without considering that it was not in her mother's plan to keep any horse that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift she must buy another for the servant and keep a servant to ride it and after all build a stable to receive them she had accepted the present without hesitation and told her sister of it in raptures,1,1,0.9930161408626434
she was faithful to her word and when willoughby called at the cottage the same day elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible his concern however was very apparent and after expressing it with earnestness he added in the same low voice -- but marianne the horse is still yours though you cannot use it now i shall keep it only till you can claim it when you leave barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home queen mab shall receive you,1,1,0.9393862936493167
margaret related something to her the next day which placed this matter in a still clearer light willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them and margaret by being left some time in the parlour with only him and marianne had had opportunity for observations which with a most important face she communicated to her eldest sister when they were next by themselves,1,1,0.9785362627681015
you have said so replied elinor almost every day since they first met on high-church down and they had not known each other a week i believe before you were certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle,1,1,0.7511969418216656
for such particulars stated on such authority elinor could not withhold her credit nor was she disposed to it for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself,1,1,0.9280668023631152
this of course made every body laugh and elinor tried to laugh too but the effort was painful she was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with mrs jennings,1,1,0.9474986546634955
their intended excursion to whitwell turned out very different from what elinor had expected she was prepared to be wet through fatigued and frightened but the event was still more unfortunate for they did not go at all,1,1,0.900230914462543
while they were at breakfast the letters were brought in among the rest there was one for colonel brandon -- he took it looked at the direction changed colour and immediately left the room,1,1,0.7632024087422445
no bad news colonel i hope said mrs jennings as soon as he entered the room,1,1,0.9718674254505214
my dear madam said lady middleton recollect what you are saying,1,1,0.892678468244321
if you would but let us know what your business is said mrs jennings we might see whether it could be put off or not,1,1,0.7508446375365483
you are very obliging but it is so uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all,1,1,0.781810639752767
did not you know said willoughby that we had been out in my curricle,1,1,0.7580213257367376
i am afraid replied elinor that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety,1,1,0.869803508270312
could elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others she would have described every room in the house with equal delight,1,1,0.941133606003354
one evening in particular about a week after colonel brandon left the country his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him and on mrs dashwood's happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him,1,1,0.9833014889689787
what he exclaimed -- improve this dear cottage no that i will never consent to not a stone must be added to its walls not an inch to its size if my feelings are regarded,1,1,0.6190858494222359
how often did i wish added he when i was at allenham this time twelvemonth that barton cottage were inhabited i never passed within view of it without admiring its situation and grieving that no one should live in it how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from mrs smith when i next came into the country would be that barton cottage was taken and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i should experience from it can account for must it not have been so marianne speaking to her in a lowered voice then continuing his former tone he said and yet this house you would spoil mrs dashwood you would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford,1,1,0.9962240901932076
mrs dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should be attempted,1,1,0.9692746284802578
this is very unfortunate but mrs smith must be obliged -- and her business will not detain you from us long i hope,1,1,0.966724103612816
he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room they saw him step into his carriage and in a minute it was out of sight,1,0,0.38275886752504673
i can hardly tell myself but suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him there is great truth however in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has but it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge them at once secrecy may be advisable but still i cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him,1,1,0.9652831429614126
concealing it from us my dear child do you accuse willoughby and marianne of concealment this is strange indeed when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness,1,1,0.8853031588353214
i want no proof of their affection said elinor but of their engagement i do,1,1,0.9531727109822081
yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject by either of them,1,1,0.6815829009826054
a mighty concession indeed if you were to see them at the altar you would suppose they were going to be married ungracious girl but i require no such proof nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt no secrecy has been attempted all has been uniformly open and unreserved you cannot doubt your sister's wishes it must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect but why is he not a man of honour and feeling has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm can he be deceitful,1,1,0.9481692014660846
you speak very properly willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected though we have not known him long he is no stranger in this part of the world and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once but this is not the case it is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance and even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now be very advisable,1,1,0.9569673581940229
such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy but these employments to which she daily recurred her solitary walks and silent meditations still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever,1,1,0.7564507267138806
no letter from willoughby came and none seemed expected by marianne her mother was surprised and elinor again became uneasy but mrs dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them which at least satisfied herself,1,1,0.9952784060655405
i would not ask such a question for the world supposing it possible that they are not engaged what distress would not such an enquiry inflict at any rate it would be most ungenerous i should never deserve her confidence again after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one i know marianne's heart i know that she dearly loves me and that i shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible i would not attempt to force the confidence of any one of a child much less because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct,1,1,0.9658776574929782
we have never finished hamlet marianne our dear willoughby went away before we could get through it we will put it by that when he comes again but it may be months perhaps before that happens,1,1,0.613817010582334
mrs dashwood was sorry for what she had said but it gave elinor pleasure as it produced a reply from marianne so expressive of confidence in willoughby and knowledge of his intentions,1,1,0.9958697218833709
he has he has cried marianne i am sure he has his air his coat his horse i knew how soon he would come,1,1,0.590059798769474
he dismounted and giving his horse to his servant walked back with them to barton whither he was purposely coming to visit them,1,1,0.7818332432995813
oh cried marianne with what transporting sensation have i formerly seen them fall how have i delighted as i walked to see them driven in showers about me by the wind what feelings have they the season the air altogether inspired now there is no one to regard them they are seen only as a nuisance swept hastily off and driven as much as possible from the sight,1,1,0.6242764327539615
it is a beautiful country he replied but these bottoms must be dirty in winter,1,0,0.3841063566299243
because replied he smiling among the rest of the objects before me i see a very dirty lane,1,0,0.446503455691252
no said marianne in a low voice nor how many painful moments,1,1,0.6611335971632909
elinor took no notice of this and directing her attention to their visitor endeavoured to support something like discourse with him by talking of their present residence its conveniences c extorting from him occasional questions and remarks his coldness and reserve mortified her severely she was vexed and half angry but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection,1,1,0.9732824387709543
what are mrs ferrars's views for you at present edward said she when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself,1,1,0.882529078222509
you have no ambition i well know your wishes are all moderate,1,0,0.47866135092644496
about eighteen hundred or two thousand a year not more than that,1,1,0.5106535829585345
marianne coloured as she replied but most people do,1,1,0.8454686998531579
no edward i should have something else to do with it,1,1,0.8287890521581065
i believe you are right he replied and yet i have always set her down as a lively girl,1,1,0.6152601265342594
elinor looked surprised at his emotion but trying to laugh off the subject she said to him do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself,1,1,0.8992141475268733
the subject was continued no farther and marianne remained thoughtfully silent till a new object suddenly engaged her attention she was sitting by edward and in taking his tea from mrs dashwood his hand passed so directly before her as to make a ring with a plait of hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his fingers,1,1,0.9000214241773011
mrs jennings enforced the necessity and who knows but you may raise a dance said she and that will tempt you miss marianne,1,1,0.9636108110224862
this and marianne's blushing gave new suspicions to edward and who is willoughby said he in a low voice to miss dashwood by whom he was sitting,1,1,0.9734095168257585
oh edward how can you -- but the time will come i hope i am sure you will like him,1,1,0.7713060994741421
elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother's account and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son disappointed however and vexed as she was and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications which had been rather more painfully extorted from her for willoughby's service by her mother his want of spirits of openness and of consistency were most usually attributed to his want of independence and his better knowledge of mrs ferrars's disposition and designs the shortness of his visit the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them originated in the same fettered inclination the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother the old well-established grievance of duty against will parent against child was the cause of all she would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease this opposition was to yield -- when mrs ferrars would be reformed and her son be at liberty to be happy but from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in edward's affection to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at barton and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger,1,1,0.9951437969221661
the consequence of which i suppose will be said mrs dashwood since leisure has not promoted your own happiness that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits employments professions and trades as columella's,1,1,0.9263409209754087
come come this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits edward you are in a melancholy humour and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy but remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times whatever be their education or state know your own happiness you want nothing but patience -- or give it a more fascinating name call it hope your mother will secure to you in time that independence you are so anxious for it is her duty and it will it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent how much may not a few months do,1,1,0.9389420583693833
this desponding turn of mind though it could not be communicated to mrs dashwood gave additional pain to them all in the parting which shortly took place and left an uncomfortable impression on elinor's feelings especially which required some trouble and time to subdue but as it was her determination to subdue it and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by marianne on a similar occasion to augment and fix her sorrow by seeking silence solitude and idleness their means were as different as their objects and equally suited to the advancement of each,1,1,0.9763561462313305
from a reverie of this kind as she sat at her drawing-table she was roused one morning soon after edward's leaving them by the arrival of company she happened to be quite alone the closing of the little gate at the entrance of the green court in front of the house drew her eyes to the window and she saw a large party walking up to the door amongst them were sir john and lady middleton and mrs jennings but there were two others a gentleman and lady who were quite unknown to her she was sitting near the window and as soon as sir john perceived her he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door and stepping across the turf obliged her to open the casement to speak to him though the space was so short between the door and the window as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other,1,1,0.9105955189714877
they were now joined by mrs jennings who had not patience enough to wait till the door was opened before she told her story she came hallooing to the window how do you do my dear how does mrs dashwood do and where are your sisters what all alone you will be glad of a little company to sit with you i have brought my other son and daughter to see you only think of their coming so suddenly i thought i heard a carriage last night while we were drinking our tea but it never entered my head that it could be them i thought of nothing but whether it might not be colonel brandon come back again so i said to sir john i do think i hear a carriage perhaps it is colonel brandon come back again --,1,1,0.957051669636629
mrs palmer was several years younger than lady middleton and totally unlike her in every respect she was short and plump had a very pretty face and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister's but they were much more prepossessing she came in with a smile smiled all the time of her visit except when she laughed and smiled when she went away her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife but of less willingness to please or be pleased he entered the room with a look of self-consequence slightly bowed to the ladies without speaking a word and after briefly surveying them and their apartments took up a newspaper from the table and continued to read it as long as he staid,1,1,0.9630791618962437
mr palmer made her no answer and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper,1,1,0.7394006289570051
he immediately went into the passage opened the front door and ushered her in himself mrs jennings asked her as soon as she appeared if she had not been to allenham and mrs palmer laughed so heartily at the question as to show she understood it mr palmer looked up on her entering the room stared at her some minutes and then returned to his newspaper mrs palmer's eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room she got up to examine them,1,1,0.9349348674148017
i am so glad to see you said she seating herself between elinor and marianne for it is so bad a day i was afraid you might not come which would be a shocking thing as we go away again tomorrow we must go for the westons come to us next week you know it was quite a sudden thing our coming at all and i knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door and then mr palmer asked me if i would go with him to barton he is so droll he never tells me any thing i am so sorry we cannot stay longer however we shall meet again in town very soon i hope,1,1,0.9697916234987374
oh my love cried mrs palmer to her husband who just then entered the room -- you must help me to persuade the miss dashwoods to go to town this winter,1,1,0.9571111566457486
i am afraid miss marianne said sir john you have not been able to take your usual walk to allenham today,1,1,0.9685770792523578
oh don't be so sly before us said mrs palmer for we know all about it i assure you and i admire your taste very much for i think he is extremely handsome we do not live a great way from him in the country you know not above ten miles i dare say,1,1,0.894503435860418
ah well there is not much difference i never was at his house but they say it is a sweet pretty place,1,1,0.6315752629906057
is it very ugly continued mrs palmer -- then it must be some other place that is so pretty i suppose,1,1,0.8303797329371665
ay you may abuse me as you please said the good-natured old lady you have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot give her back again so there i have the whip hand of you,1,1,0.5579387428946232
oh my dear miss dashwood said mrs palmer soon afterwards i have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister will you come and spend some time at cleveland this christmas now pray do -- and come while the westons are with us you cannot think how happy i shall be it will be quite delightful -- my love applying to her husband don't you long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland,1,1,0.9836611617274547
they both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation,1,1,0.8564698458249439
elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the hardship of such an obligation,1,1,0.8727378457718578
upon my honour i did -- i met colonel brandon monday morning in bond-street just before we left town and he told me of it directly,1,1,0.8432318184342232
you surprise me very much colonel brandon tell you of it surely you must be mistaken to give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it even if it were true is not what i should expect colonel brandon to do,1,1,0.9437698909617908
oh yes extremely well that is i do not believe many people are acquainted with him because combe magna is so far off but they all think him extremely agreeable i assure you nobody is more liked than mr willoughby wherever he goes and so you may tell your sister she is a monstrous lucky girl to get him upon my honour not but that he is much more lucky in getting her because she is so very handsome and agreeable that nothing can be good enough for her however i don't think her hardly at all handsomer than you i assure you for i think you both excessively pretty and so does mr palmer too i am sure though we could not get him to own it last night,1,1,0.9822805546368791
oh no but if mama had not objected to it i dare say he would have liked it of all things he had not seen me then above twice for it was before i left school however i am much happier as i am mr palmer is the kind of man i like,1,1,0.8337280876348772
but sir john could not prevail he could only obtain a promise of their calling at the park within a day or two and then left them in amazement at their indifference to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the miss steeles as he had been already boasting of the miss steeles to them,1,1,0.9507628871489404
john is in such spirits today said she on his taking miss steeles's pocket handkerchief and throwing it out of window -- he is full of monkey tricks,1,1,0.5961787324159621
marianne was silent it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel however trivial the occasion and upon elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it always fell she did her best when thus called on by speaking of lady middleton with more warmth than she felt though with far less than miss lucy,1,1,0.9849414489283826
not so the miss steeles -- they came from exeter well provided with admiration for the use of sir john middleton his family and all his relations and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins whom they declared to be the most beautiful elegant accomplished and agreeable girls they had ever beheld and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted -- and to be better acquainted therefore elinor soon found was their inevitable lot for as sir john was entirely on the side of the miss steeles their party would be too strong for opposition and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the same room almost every day sir john could do no more but he did not know that any more was required to be together was in his opinion to be intimate and while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual he had not a doubt of their being established friends,1,1,0.9971022010835953
marianne who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence vulgarity inferiority of parts or even difference of taste from herself was at this time particularly ill-disposed from the state of her spirits to be pleased with the miss steeles or to encourage their advances and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side elinor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both but especially of lucy who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments,1,1,0.9976803385665918
elinor did think the question a very odd one and her countenance expressed it as she answered that she had never seen mrs ferrars,1,1,0.9733207314247813
elinor made her a civil reply and they walked on for a few minutes in silence it was broken by lucy who renewed the subject again by saying with some hesitation,1,1,0.9279584607658933
i cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious i am sure i would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours and i am sure i should not have the smallest fear of trusting you indeed i should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation as i am but however there is no occasion to trouble you i am sorry you do not happen to know mrs ferrars,1,1,0.9609277252703825
i am sorry i do not said elinor in great astonishment if it could be of any use to you to know my opinion of her but really i never understood that you were at all connected with that family and therefore i am a little surprised i confess at so serious an inquiry into her character,1,1,0.9563078845636035
good heavens cried elinor what do you mean are you acquainted with mr robert ferrars can you be and she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law,1,1,0.979196562394198
elinor though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe it,1,1,0.9320126485406429
i did not know said she that you were even acquainted till the other day,1,1,0.6789515846708871
i think i have replied elinor with an exertion of spirits which increased with her increase of emotion,1,1,0.9675031565300581
he was four years with my uncle who lives at longstaple near plymouth it was there our acquaintance begun for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle and it was there our engagement was formed though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil but he was almost always with us afterwards i was very unwilling to enter into it as you may imagine without the knowledge and approbation of his mother but i was too young and loved him too well to be so prudent as i ought to have been -- though you do not know him so well as me miss dashwood you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him,1,1,0.9886157666421443
certainly answered elinor without knowing what she said but after a moment's reflection she added with revived security of edward's honour and love and her companion's falsehood -- engaged to mr edward ferrars -- i confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me that really -- i beg your pardon but surely there must be some mistake of person or name we cannot mean the same mr ferrars,1,1,0.9768823193201823
it is strange replied elinor in a most painful perplexity that i should never have heard him even mention your name,1,1,0.845077815567557
she was silent -- elinor's security sunk but her self-command did not sink with it,1,1,0.8557750568249431
did he come from your uncle's then when he visited us,1,1,0.5621316896500201
i did said elinor with a composure of voice under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before she was mortified shocked confounded,1,1,0.8972372201016581
you are very good i hope it won't hurt your eyes -- will you ring the bell for some working candles my poor little girl would be sadly disappointed i know if the basket was not finished tomorrow for though i told her it certainly would not i am sure she depends upon having it done,1,1,0.6876970676959128
lady middleton proposed a rubber of casino to the others no one made any objection but marianne who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility exclaimed your ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me -- you know i detest cards i shall go to the piano-forte i have not touched it since it was tuned and without farther ceremony she turned away and walked to the instrument,1,1,0.9463376742107058
you are very kind said lady middleton to elinor and as you really like the work perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber or will you take your chance now,1,1,0.7748268917698833
that conviction must be every thing to you and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your's if the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed as between many people and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years' engagement your situation would have been pitiable indeed,1,1,0.9627309726506331
lucy here looked up but elinor was careful in guarding her countenance from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency,1,1,0.8994448116548487
elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion,1,1,0.8519365265638057
and for your own sake too or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason,1,0,0.47759136012254916
not at all -- i never saw him but i fancy he is very unlike his brother -- silly and a great coxcomb,1,1,0.6159078591778069
i can answer for it that miss dashwood's is not said mrs jennings laughing heartily for he is one of the modestest prettiest behaved young men i ever saw but as for lucy she is such a sly little creature there is no finding out who she likes,1,1,0.9550431132631045
oh cried miss steele looking significantly round at them i dare say lucy's beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as miss dashwood's,1,1,0.9691036954601772
elinor blushed in spite of herself lucy bit her lip and looked angrily at her sister a mutual silence took place for some time lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone though marianne was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto --,1,1,0.9358660678880779
they were again silent for many minutes at length lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh,1,1,0.7483136109556637
elinor blushed for the insincerity of edward's future wife and replied this compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had i formed one it raises my influence much too high the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person,1,1,0.9553037276795086
i am sorry for that returned the other while her eyes brightened at the information it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there but i dare say you will go for all that to be sure your brother and sister will ask you to come to them,1,1,0.8423157550001538
though mrs jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends she was not without a settled habitation of her own since the death of her husband who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near portman square towards this home she began on the approach of january to turn her thoughts and thither she one day abruptly and very unexpectedly by them asked the elder misses dashwood to accompany her elinor without observing the varying complexion of her sister and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations the reason alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the year mrs jennings received the refusal with some surprise and repeated her invitation immediately,1,1,0.992616797111246
i have a notion said sir john that miss marianne would not object to such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it it is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure because miss dashwood does not wish it so i would advise you two to set off for town when you are tired of barton without saying a word to miss dashwood about it,1,1,0.9910796831143994
i thank you ma'am sincerely thank you said marianne with warmth your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable of to be able to accept it but my mother my dearest kindest mother -- i feel the justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence -- oh no nothing should tempt me to leave her it should not must not be a struggle,1,1,0.989427266579602
and what said mrs dashwood is my dear prudent elinor going to suggest what formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward do let me hear a word about the expense of it,1,1,0.8889193406843318
elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading marianne to behave with tolerable politeness and resolved within herself that if her sister persisted in going she would go likewise as she did not think it proper that marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment or that mrs jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours to this determination she was the more easily reconciled by recollecting that edward ferrars by lucy's account was not to be in town before february and that their visit without any unreasonable abridgement might be previously finished,1,1,0.9992614312653865
i will have you both go said mrs dashwood these objections are nonsensical you will have much pleasure in being in london and especially in being together and if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of sources she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister-in-law's family,1,1,0.986546027789839
he heard her with the most earnest attention but seeming to recollect himself said no more on the subject and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in london making the usual inquiries about their journey and the friends they had left behind,1,1,0.9428414544213831
oh you did well and how do they all do at their house how does charlotte do i warrant you she is a fine size by this time,1,1,0.6771379294910691
he replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries but without satisfying her in any elinor now began to make the tea and marianne was obliged to appear again,1,1,0.9524564606304419
marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks the disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen that day they had not long finished their breakfast before mrs palmer's barouche stopped at the door and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room so delighted to see them all that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the miss dashwoods again so surprised at their coming to town though it was what she had rather expected all along so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation after having declined her own though at the same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come,1,1,0.9911293045525159
mr palmer will be so happy to see you said she what do you think he said when he heard of your coming with mamma i forget what it was now but it was something so droll,1,1,0.8701966996374226
mrs palmer and two elderly ladies of mrs jennings's intimate acquaintance whom she had met and invited in the morning dined with them the former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements and elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others marianne was of no use on these occasions as she would never learn the game but though her time was therefore at her own disposal the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to elinor for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment she sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read but the book was soon thrown aside and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap,1,1,0.9973184044885705
but if she did the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact whatever the truth of it might be and far as elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it yet while she saw marianne in spirits she could not be very uncomfortable herself and marianne was in spirits happy in the mildness of the weather and still happier in her expectation of a frost,1,1,0.9755713091872108
elinor was alternately diverted and pained but marianne persevered and saw every night in the brightness of the fire and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere the certain symptoms of approaching frost,1,1,0.7834028981088962
good god cried marianne he has been here while we were out elinor rejoiced to be assured of his being in london now ventured to say depend upon it he will call again tomorrow but marianne seemed hardly to hear her and on mrs jenning's entrance escaped with the precious card,1,1,0.9720773930281046
about the middle of the day mrs jennings went out by herself on business and elinor began her letter directly while marianne too restless for employment too anxious for conversation walked from one window to the other or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother relating all that had passed her suspicions of willoughby's inconstancy urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him,1,1,0.9937439547059121
it cannot be generally known returned elinor for her own family do not know it,1,1,0.9596177642116539
elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points she was left on the contrary with a melancholy impression of colonel brandon's unhappiness and was prevented even from wishing it removed by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it,1,1,0.9891225153320629
this however was more than she could believe herself and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of marianne it was beyond her wish she sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature,1,1,0.9221857197537483
he could not then avoid it but her touch seemed painful to him and he held her hand only for a moment during all this time he was evidently struggling for composure elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil after a moment's pause he spoke with calmness,1,1,0.7543906570921929
i did myself the honour of calling in berkeley street last tuesday and very much regretted that i was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and mrs jennings at home my card was not lost i hope,1,1,0.9403923062952317
marianne now looking dreadfully white and unable to stand sunk into her chair and elinor expecting every moment to see her faint tried to screen her from the observation of others while reviving her with lavender water,1,1,0.8390008196977906
how can that be done no my dearest marianne you must wait this is not the place for explanations wait only till tomorrow,1,1,0.7353799944332078
that some kind of engagement had subsisted between willoughby and marianne she could not doubt and that willoughby was weary of it seemed equally clear for however marianne might still feed her own wishes she could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or misapprehension of any kind nothing but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it her indignation would have been still stronger than it was had she not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct and prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the affections of her sister from the first without any design that would bear investigation absence might have weakened his regard and convenience might have determined him to overcome it but that such a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt,1,1,0.9979632169922027
before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day or the sun gained any power over a cold gloomy morning in january marianne only half dressed was kneeling against one of the window-seats for the sake of all the little light she could command from it and writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her in this situation elinor roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs first perceived her and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety said in a tone of the most considerate gentleness,1,1,0.8656059230776555
as this was a favourite meal with mrs jennings it lasted a considerable time and they were just setting themselves after it round the common working table when a letter was delivered to marianne which she eagerly caught from the servant and turning of a death-like paleness instantly ran out of the room elinor who saw as plainly by this as if she had seen the direction that it must come from willoughby felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape mrs jenning's notice that good lady however saw only that marianne had received a letter from willoughby which appeared to her a very good joke and which she treated accordingly by hoping with a laugh that she would find it to her liking of elinor's distress she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug to see any thing at all and calmly continuing her talk as soon as marianne disappeared she said,1,1,0.9922737642999159
upon my word i never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life my girls were nothing to her and yet they used to be foolish enough but as for miss marianne she is quite an altered creature i hope from the bottom of my heart he won't keep her waiting much longer for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn pray when are they to be married,1,1,0.8888400816645818
indeed ma'am said elinor very seriously you are mistaken indeed you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now,1,1,0.8455935010791901
i am dear madam your most obedient humble servant john willoughby,1,1,0.8723886844054028
this as every thing else would have been was too much for marianne who could only exclaim in the anguish of her heart oh elinor i am miserable indeed before her voice was entirely lost in sobs,1,1,0.9301781839427403
elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence,1,1,0.6630154646464927
i cannot i cannot cried marianne leave me leave me if i distress you leave me hate me forget me but do not torture me so oh how easy for those who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion happy happy elinor you cannot have an idea of what i suffer,1,1,0.8664224906472657
and you will never see me otherwise mine is a misery which nothing can do away,1,1,0.6020806754385741
how surprised you will be willoughby on receiving this and i think you will feel something more than surprise when you know that i am in town an opportunity of coming hither though with mrs jennings was a temptation we could not resist i wish you may receive this in time to come here to-night but i will not depend on it at any rate i shall expect you to-morrow for the present adieu,1,1,0.9456195786288778
i can believe it said elinor but unfortunately he did not feel the same,1,1,0.8455814649132465
he did feel the same elinor -- for weeks and weeks he felt it i know he did whatever may have changed him now and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it i was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish this lock of hair which now he can so readily give up was begged of me with the most earnest supplication had you seen his look his manner had you heard his voice at that moment have you forgot the last evening of our being together at barton the morning that we parted too when he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again -- his distress -- can i ever forget his distress,1,1,0.9130659446546021
again they were both silent elinor was employed in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window from the window to the fire without knowing that she received warmth from one or discerning objects through the other and marianne seated at the foot of the bed with her head leaning against one of its posts again took up willoughby's letter and after shuddering over every sentence exclaimed --,1,1,0.6682129090144175
well then another day or two perhaps but i cannot stay here long i cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people the middletons and palmers -- how am i to bear their pity the pity of such a woman as lady middleton oh what would he say to that,1,1,0.8288700009560216
she then went away walking on tiptoe out of the room as if she supposed her young friend's affliction could be increased by noise,1,1,0.6918632480190158
elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt and before breakfast was ready they had gone through the subject again and again and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on elinor's side the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on marianne's as before sometimes she could believe willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself and at others lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him at one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world at another she would seclude herself from it for ever and at a third could resist it with energy in one thing however she was uniform when it came to the point in avoiding where it was possible the presence of mrs jennings and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it her heart was hardened against the belief of mrs jennings's entering into her sorrows with any compassion,1,1,0.993247163027748
mrs jennings left them earlier than usual for she could not be easy till the middletons and palmers were able to grieve as much as herself and positively refusing elinor's offered attendance went out alone for the rest of the morning elinor with a very heavy heart aware of the pain she was going to communicate and perceiving by marianne's letter how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed and entreat her directions for the future while marianne who came into the drawing-room on mrs jennings's going away remained fixed at the table where elinor wrote watching the advancement of her pen grieving over her for the hardship of such a task and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother,1,1,0.9950634088271305
it is colonel brandon said she with vexation we are never safe from him,1,1,0.8137011285797332
the event proved her conjecture right though it was founded on injustice and error for colonel brandon did come in and elinor who was convinced that solicitude for marianne brought him thither and who saw that solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly,1,1,0.9779969081459465
i understand you said elinor you have something to tell me of mr willoughby that will open his character farther your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn marianne my gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end and hers must be gained by it in time pray pray let me hear it,1,1,0.9579379044418314
your sister i hope cannot be offended said he by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation their fates their fortunes cannot be the same and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you will live to see the other be but to what does all this lead i seem to have been distressing you for nothing ah miss dashwood -- a subject such as this -- untouched for fourteen years -- it is dangerous to handle it at all i will be more collected -- more concise she left to my care her only child a little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then about three years old she loved the child and had always kept it with her it was a valued a precious trust to me and gladly would i have discharged it in the strictest sense by watching over her education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it but i had no family no home and my little eliza was therefore placed at school i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my brother which happened about five years ago and which left to me the possession of the family property she visited me at delaford i called her a distant relation but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her it is now three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year that i removed her from school to place her under the care of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation but last february almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared i had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned out at her earnest desire to go to bath with one of her young friends who was attending her father there for his health i knew him to be a very good sort of man and i thought well of his daughter -- better than she deserved for with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy she would tell nothing would give no clue though she certainly knew all he her father a well-meaning but not a quick-sighted man could really i believe give no information for he had been generally confined to the house while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose and he tried to convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business in short i could learn nothing but that she was gone all the rest for eight long months was left to conjecture what i thought what i feared may be imagined and what i suffered too,1,1,0.9944973332332372
i have been more pained said she by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do now though at first she will suffer much i am sure she will soon become easier have you she continued after a short silence ever seen mr willoughby since you left him at barton,1,1,0.9613987763058451
yes he replied gravely once i have one meeting was unavoidable,1,1,0.5181890762712358
elinor startled by his manner looked at him anxiously saying,1,1,0.7481908965224251
elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it,1,1,0.7817412275866503
against the interest of her own individual comfort mrs dashwood had determined that it would be better for marianne to be any where at that time than at barton where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner by constantly placing willoughby before her such as she had always seen him there she recommended it to her daughters therefore by all means not to shorten their visit to mrs jennings the length of which though never exactly fixed had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks a variety of occupations of objects and of company which could not be procured at barton would be inevitable there and might yet she hoped cheat marianne at times into some interest beyond herself and even into some amusement much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her,1,1,0.9973941826575716
marianne had promised to be guided by her mother's opinion and she submitted to it therefore without opposition though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected though she felt it to be entirely wrong formed on mistaken grounds and that by requiring her longer continuance in london it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness the personal sympathy of her mother and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment's rest,1,1,0.9938288550434394
elinor only was sorry to see them their presence always gave her pain and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of lucy in finding her still in town,1,1,0.9630436527915379
i should have been quite disappointed if i had not found you here still said she repeatedly with a strong emphasis on the word but i always thought i should i was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile though you told me you know at barton that you should not stay above a month but i thought at the time that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point it would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came and now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone i am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word,1,1,0.8807339462985186
oh oh cried mrs jennings very pretty indeed and the doctor is a single man i warrant you,1,1,0.7845647156453572
no indeed replied her cousin with affected earnestness and i beg you will contradict it if you ever hear it talked of,1,1,0.8309431869398481
mrs jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she certainly would not and miss steele was made completely happy,1,1,0.9921614494338109
what a charming thing it is that mrs dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together,1,1,0.9456916642589096
i am sorry we cannot see your sister miss dashwood said miss steele i am sorry she is not well -- for marianne had left the room on their arrival,1,1,0.9882648728827245
you are very good my sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches which make her unfit for company or conversation,1,1,0.957831503377336
he likes you i observed him narrowly and am convinced of it what is the amount of his fortune,1,1,0.6535572356009373
it would be something remarkable now he continued something droll if fanny should have a brother and i a sister settling at the same time and yet it is not very unlikely,1,1,0.8510981441723581
not so large i dare say as many people suppose i do not mean to complain however it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope will in time be better the enclosure of norland common now carrying on is a most serious drain and then i have made a little purchase within this half year east kingham farm you must remember the place where old gibson used to live the land was so very desirable for me in every respect so immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it my duty to buy it i could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands a man must pay for his convenience and it has cost me a vast deal of money,1,1,0.8073045437186036
elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself and was very thankful that marianne was not present to share the provocation,1,1,0.9841430804160394
nothing at all i should rather suppose for she has only her jointure which will descend to her children,1,1,0.7124385964772273
but it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income few people of common prudence will do that and whatever she saves she will be able to dispose of,1,1,0.8277137578802055
and do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters than to us,1,1,0.8554753188159456
lady middleton was equally pleased with mrs dashwood there was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides which mutually attracted them and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor and a general want of understanding,1,1,0.9524561235142289
on elinor its effect was very different she began immediately to determine that edward who lived with his mother must be asked as his mother was to a party given by his sister and to see him for the first time after all that passed in the company of lucy -- she hardly knew how she could bear it,1,1,0.9852340368551901
the two mothers though each really convinced that her own son was the tallest politely decided in favour of the other,1,1,0.6240752976170623
do you not think they are something in miss morton's style of painting ma'am -- she does paint most delightfully -- how beautifully her last landscape is done,1,1,0.8498879144642575
marianne could not bear this -- she was already greatly displeased with mrs ferrars and such ill-timed praise of another at elinor's expense though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by it provoked her immediately to say with warmth,1,1,0.9930417176261743
and so saying she took the screens out of her sister-in-law's hands to admire them herself as they ought to be admired,1,1,0.856098084342617
poor marianne said her brother to colonel brandon in a low voice as soon as he could secure his attention -- she has not such good health as her sister -- she is very nervous -- she has not elinor's constitution -- and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who has been a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions you would not think it perhaps but marianne was remarkably handsome a few months ago quite as handsome as elinor -- now you see it is all gone,1,1,0.9958065256798512
the chance proved a lucky one for a message from mrs palmer soon after she arrived carried mrs jennings away,1,1,0.9750246954812248
my dear friend cried lucy as soon as they were by themselves i come to talk to you of my happiness could anything be so flattering as mrs ferrars's way of treating me yesterday so exceeding affable as she was -- you know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her -- but the very moment i was introduced there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say she had quite took a fancy to me now was not it so -- you saw it all and was not you quite struck with it,1,1,0.971703620141154
civil -- did you see nothing but only civility -- i saw a vast deal more such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me -- no pride no hauteur and your sister just the same -- all sweetness and affability,1,1,0.7644748342320224
are you ill miss dashwood -- you seem low -- you don't speak -- sure you an't well,1,1,0.7724270681054572
it was a very awkward moment and the countenance of each shewed that it was so they all looked exceedingly foolish and edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again as to advance farther into it the very circumstance in its unpleasantest form which they would each have been most anxious to avoid had fallen on them -- they were not only all three together but were together without the relief of any other person the ladies recovered themselves first it was not lucy's business to put herself forward and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up she could therefore only look her tenderness and after slightly addressing him said no more,1,1,0.9707726524405669
her exertions did not stop here for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine under pretence of fetching marianne to leave the others by themselves and she really did it and that in the handsomest manner for she loitered away several minutes on the landing-place with the most high-minded fortitude before she went to her sister when that was once done however it was time for the raptures of edward to cease for marianne's joy hurried her into the drawing-room immediately her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings strong in itself and strongly spoken she met him with a hand that would be taken and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister,1,1,0.985329431391563
oh don't think of me she replied with spirited earnestness though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke don't think of my health elinor is well you see that must be enough for us both,1,1,0.6858034327884802
i think elinor she presently added we must employ edward to take care of us in our return to barton in a week or two i suppose we shall be going and i trust edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge,1,1,0.9620679975690134
poor edward muttered something but what it was nobody knew not even himself but marianne who saw his agitation and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself was perfectly satisfied and soon talked of something else,1,1,0.930439628605161
she then left the room and elinor dared not follow her to say more for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to lucy she could give no information that would convince marianne and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be she was obliged to submit to it all that she could hope was that edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing marianne's mistaken warmth nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting -- and this she had every reason to expect,1,1,0.9936973137754559
all these jealousies and discontents however were so totally unsuspected by mrs jennings that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together and generally congratulated her young friends every night on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long she joined them sometimes at sir john's sometimes at her own house but wherever it was she always came in excellent spirits full of delight and importance attributing charlotte's well doing to her own care and ready to give so exact so minute a detail of her situation as only miss steele had curiosity enough to desire one thing did disturb her and of that she made her daily complaint mr palmer maintained the common but unfatherly opinion among his sex of all infants being alike and though she could plainly perceive at different times the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides there was no convincing his father of it no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like every other baby of the same age nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the world,1,1,0.989776051984295
to her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent as not to bestow half the consideration on it during the whole of her toilet which it received from miss steele in the first five minutes of their being together when it was finished nothing escaped her minute observation and general curiosity she saw every thing and asked every thing was never easy till she knew the price of every part of marianne's dress could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than marianne herself and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted how much her washing cost per week and how much she had every year to spend upon herself the impertinence of these kind of scrutinies moreover was generally concluded with a compliment which though meant as its douceur was considered by marianne as the greatest impertinence of all for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown the colour of her shoes and the arrangement of her hair she was almost sure of being told that upon her word she looked vastly smart and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests,1,1,0.9898440084524234
the events of this evening were not very remarkable the party like other musical parties comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance and a great many more who had none at all and the performers themselves were as usual in their own estimation and that of their immediate friends the first private performers in england,1,1,0.7936444249539392
you reside in devonshire i think -- was his next observation in a cottage near dawlish,1,1,0.8398695542937165
mr dashwood was convinced he saw the necessity of inviting the miss steeles immediately and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters another year at the same time however slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless by bringing elinor to town as colonel brandon's wife and marianne as their visitor,1,1,0.995284457620604
when the note was shown to elinor as it was within ten minutes after its arrival it gave her for the first time some share in the expectations of lucy for such a mark of uncommon kindness vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance seemed to declare that the good-will towards her arose from something more than merely malice against herself and might be brought by time and address to do every thing that lucy wished her flattery had already subdued the pride of lady middleton and made an entry into the close heart of mrs john dashwood and these were effects that laid open the probability of greater,1,1,0.9932025974534169
at this point in the first and second edtions volume ii ended,1,0,0.43563842237260697
lord my dear miss dashwood have you heard the news,1,1,0.9018604840329345
at these words marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter after a pause of wonder she exclaimed --,1,1,0.6909242972233453
can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man continued john than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own poor edward i feel for him sincerely,1,1,0.9115236904673245
marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in elinor and unnecessary in mrs jennings they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party,1,1,0.9880192352833076
she felt all the force of that comparison but not as her sister had hoped to urge her to exertion now she felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before but it brought only the torture of penitence without the hope of amendment her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible and therefore it only dispirited her more,1,1,0.974363018002028
the third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars was so fine so beautiful a sunday as to draw many to kensington gardens though it was only the second week in march mrs jennings and elinor were of the number but marianne who knew that the willoughbys were again in town and had a constant dread of meeting them chose rather to stay at home than venture into so public a place,1,1,0.9075286162222189
that is a good thing and lady middleton is she angry,1,1,0.8280999296232463
i am monstrous glad of it good gracious i have had such a time of it i never saw lucy in such a rage in my life she vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet nor do any thing else for me again so long as she lived but now she is quite come to and we are as good friends as ever look she made me this bow to my hat and put in the feather last night there now you are going to laugh at me too but why should not i wear pink ribbons i do not care if it is the doctor's favourite colour i am sure for my part i should never have known he did like it better than any other colour if he had not happened to say so my cousins have been so plaguing me i declare sometimes i do not know which way to look before them,1,1,0.6438590688231195
she had wandered away to a subject on which elinor had nothing to say and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first,1,1,0.9333673713384711
oh did not you but it was said i know very well and by more than one for miss godby told miss sparks that nobody in their senses could expect mr ferrars to give up a woman like miss morton with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune for lucy steele that had nothing at all and i had it from miss sparks myself and besides that my cousin richard said himself that when it came to the point he was afraid mr ferrars would be off and when edward did not come near us for three days i could not tell what to think myself and i believe in my heart lucy gave it up all for lost for we came away from your brother's wednesday and we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday and saturday and did not know what was become of him once lucy thought to write to him but then her spirits rose against that however this morning he came just as we came home from church and then it all came out how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street and been talked to by his mother and all of them and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but lucy and nobody but lucy would he have and how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon as he had went away from his mother's house he had got upon his horse and rid into the country some where or other and how he had stayed about at an inn all thursday and friday on purpose to get the better of it and after thinking it all over and over again he said it seemed to him as if now he had no fortune and no nothing at all it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement because it must be for her loss for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope of any thing else and if he was to go into orders as he had some thoughts he could get nothing but a curacy and how was they to live upon that -- he could not bear to think of her doing no better and so he begged if she had the least mind for it to put an end to the matter directly and leave him shift for himself i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be and it was entirely for her sake and upon her account that he said a word about being off and not upon his own i will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her or of wishing to marry miss morton or any thing like it but to be sure lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking so she told him directly with a great deal about sweet and love you know and all that -- oh la one can't repeat such kind of things you know -- she told him directly she had not the least mind in the world to be off for she could live with him upon a trifle and how little so ever he might have she should be very glad to have it all you know or something of the kind so then he was monstrous happy and talked on some time about what they should do and they agreed he should take orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living and just then i could not hear any more for my cousin called from below to tell me mrs richardson was come in her coach and would take one of us to kensington gardens so i was forced to go into the room and interrupt them to ask lucy if she would like to go but she did not care to leave edward so i just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardsons,1,1,0.9810816424363631
as soon as elinor had finished it she performed what she concluded to be its writer's real design by placing it in the hands of mrs jennings who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise,1,1,0.9487803296485354
but it is in somersetshire -- i cannot go into somersetshire -- there where i looked forward to going no elinor you cannot expect me to go there,1,1,0.7508111519529226
elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings -- she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others -- represented it therefore as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother whom she so much wished to see in a more eligible more comfortable manner than any other plan could do and perhaps without any greater delay from cleveland which was within a few miles of bristol the distance to barton was not beyond one day though a long day's journey and their mother's servant might easily come there to attend them down and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at cleveland they might now be at home in little more than three weeks' time as marianne's affection for her mother was sincere it must triumph with little difficulty over the imaginary evils she had started,1,1,0.9945924957654244
ah colonel i do not know what you and i shall do without the miss dashwoods -- was mrs jennings's address to him when he first called on her after their leaving her was settled -- for they are quite resolved upon going home from the palmers -- and how forlorn we shall be when i come back -- lord we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats,1,1,0.8704073467045434
this delay on the colonel's side however did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards and moving different ways mrs jennings very plainly heard elinor say and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said,1,1,0.9292692154450477
mrs jennings was delighted with her gratitude and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence the colonel should be able to take leave of them as he immediately did with the utmost sang-froid and go away without making her any reply -- she had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor,1,1,0.9853995242442027
the cruelty the impolitic cruelty -- he replied with great feeling -- of dividing or attempting to divide two young people long attached to each other is terrible -- mrs ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to i have seen mr ferrars two or three times in harley street and am much pleased with him he is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time but i have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake and as a friend of yours i wish it still more i understand that he intends to take orders will you be so good as to tell him that the living of delaford now just vacant as i am informed by this day's post is his if he think it worth his acceptance -- but that perhaps so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now it may be nonsense to appear to doubt i only wish it were more valuable -- it is a rectory but a small one the late incumbent i believe did not make more than 200 l per annum and though it is certainly capable of improvement i fear not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income such as it is however my pleasure in presenting him to it will be very great pray assure him of it,1,1,0.9768979476294394
by which the colonel was surprised to find that she was considering mr ferrars's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation for he did not suppose it possible that delaford living could supply such an income as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on -- and he said so,1,1,0.9724287800166297
thank you ma'am said elinor it is a matter of great joy to me and i feel the goodness of colonel brandon most sensibly there are not many men who would act as he has done few people who have so compassionate a heart i never was more astonished in my life,1,1,0.884923510398443
elinor did not quite understand the beginning of mrs jennings's speech neither did she think it worth inquiring into and therefore only replied to its conclusion,1,1,0.9572081100721443
and so you are forced to do it well that is an odd kind of delicacy however i will not disturb you seeing her preparing to write you know your own concerns best so goodby my dear i have not heard of any thing to please me so well since charlotte was brought to bed,1,1,0.914658635430396
you would not have gone however said elinor recovering herself and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible without receiving our good wishes even if we had not been able to give them in person mrs jennings was quite right in what she said i have something of consequence to inform you of which i was on the point of communicating by paper i am charged with a most agreeable office breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke colonel brandon who was here only ten minutes ago has desired me to say that understanding you mean to take orders he has great pleasure in offering you the living of delaford now just vacant and only wishes it were more valuable allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well-judging a friend and to join in his wish that the living -- it is about two hundred a-year -- were much more considerable and such as might better enable you to -- as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself -- such in short as might establish all your views of happiness,1,1,0.9918065646300054
what edward felt as he could not say it himself it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him he looked all the astonishment which such unexpected such unthought-of information could not fail of exciting but he said only these two words,1,1,0.7900420845057053
you are very much mistaken i do assure you that you owe it entirely at least almost entirely to your own merit and colonel brandon's discernment of it i have had no hand in it i did not even know till i understood his design that the living was vacant nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift as a friend of mine of my family he may perhaps -- indeed i know he has still greater pleasure in bestowing it but upon my word you owe nothing to my solicitation,1,1,0.8896504996651585
colonel brandon i think lodges in st james street said he soon afterwards rising from his chair,1,1,0.5040009196713996
but colonel brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living's being enough to allow them to marry,1,1,0.9326846759005352
her own happiness and her own spirits were at least very certain and she joined mrs jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in delaford parsonage before michaelmas so far was she at the same time from any backwardness to give elinor that credit which edward would give her that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth was ready to own all their obligation to her and openly declared that no exertion for their good on miss dashwood's part either present or future would ever surprise her for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued as for colonel brandon she was not only ready to worship him as a saint but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost and scarcely resolved to avail herself at delaford as far as she possibly could of his servants his carriage his cows and his poultry,1,1,0.9985367275080899
it was now above a week since john dashwood had called in berkeley street and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife's indisposition beyond one verbal enquiry elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit -- this was an obligation however which not only opposed her own inclination but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions marianne not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself was very urgent to prevent her sister's going at all and mrs jennings though her carriage was always at elinor's service so very much disliked mrs john dashwood that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery nor her strong desire to affront her by taking edward's part could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again the consequence was that elinor set out by herself to pay a visit for which no one could really have less inclination and to run the risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike,1,1,0.9993461248031912
they walked up stairs in to the drawing-room -- nobody was there,1,1,0.6677439254140676
fanny is in her own room i suppose said he -- i will go to her presently for i am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing you -- very far from it indeed now especially there cannot be -- but however you and marianne were always great favourites -- why would not marianne come --,1,1,0.9765385326843515
elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing that she thought fanny might have borne with composure an acquisition of wealth to her brother by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished,1,1,0.9523429530342675
elinor smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother's tone calmly replied,1,1,0.8104863929477033
they had scarcely been two minutes by themselves before he began to speak of edward for he too had heard of the living and was very inquisitive on the subject elinor repeated the particulars of it as she had given them to john and their effect on robert though very different was not less striking than it had been on him he laughed most immoderately the idea of edward's being a clergyman and living in a small parsonage-house diverted him beyond measure -- and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of edward reading prayers in a white surplice and publishing the banns of marriage between john smith and mary brown he could conceive nothing more ridiculous,1,1,0.9842806117027233
we may treat it as a joke said he at last recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment -- but upon my soul it is a most serious business poor edward he is ruined for ever i am extremely sorry for it -- for i know him to be a very good-hearted creature as well-meaning a fellow perhaps as any in the world you must not judge of him miss dashwood from your slight acquaintance -- poor edward -- his manners are certainly not the happiest in nature -- but we are not all born you know with the same powers -- the same address -- poor fellow -- to see him in a circle of strangers -- to be sure it was pitiable enough -- but upon my soul i believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom and i declare and protest to you i never was so shocked in my life as when it all burst forth i could not believe it -- my mother was the first person who told me of it and i feeling myself called on to act with resolution immediately said to her 'my dear madam i do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion but as for myself i must say that if edward does marry this young woman i never will see him again ' that was what i said immediately -- i was most uncommonly shocked indeed -- poor edward -- he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society -- but as i directly said to my mother i am not in the least surprised at it from his style of education it was always to be expected my poor mother was half frantic,1,1,0.9695796172850171
yes once while she was staying in this house i happened to drop in for ten minutes and i saw quite enough of her the merest awkward country girl without style or elegance and almost without beauty -- i remember her perfectly just the kind of girl i should suppose likely to captivate poor edward i offered immediately as soon as my mother related the affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuade him from the match but it was too late then i found to do any thing for unluckily i was not in the way at first and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place when it was not for me you know to interfere but had i been informed of it a few hours earlier -- i think it is most probable -- that something might have been hit on i certainly should have represented it to edward in a very strong light 'my dear fellow ' i should have said 'consider what you are doing you are making a most disgraceful connection and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving ' i cannot help thinking in short that means might have been found but now it is all too late he must be starved you know -- that is certain absolutely starved,1,1,0.9732724701653419
their journey was safely performed the second day brought them into the cherished or the prohibited county of somerset for as such was it dwelt on by turns in marianne's imagination and in the forenoon of the third they drove up to cleveland,1,1,0.7606607544173959
in such moments of precious invaluable misery she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at cleveland and as she returned by a different circuit to the house feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the palmers in the indulgence of such solitary rambles,1,1,0.9086124280650161
of edward or at least of some of his concerns she now received intelligence from colonel brandon who had been into dorsetshire lately and who treating her at once as the disinterested friend of mr ferrars and the kind of confidant of himself talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at delaford described its deficiencies and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them -- his behaviour to her in this as well as in every other particular his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days his readiness to converse with her and his deference for her opinion might very well justify mrs jennings's persuasion of his attachment and would have been enough perhaps had not elinor still as from the first believed marianne his real favourite to make her suspect it herself but as it was such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head except by mrs jennings's suggestion and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two -- she watched his eyes while mrs jennings thought only of his behaviour -- and while his looks of anxious solicitude on marianne's feeling in her head and throat the beginning of a heavy cold because unexpressed by words entirely escaped the latter lady's observation -- she could discover in them the quick feelings and needless alarm of a lover,1,1,0.9989889502027752
two delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery but all over the grounds and especially in the most distant parts of them where there was something more of wildness than in the rest where the trees were the oldest and the grass was the longest and wettest had -- assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings -- given marianne a cold so violent as though for a day or two trifled with or denied would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body and the notice of herself prescriptions poured in from all quarters and as usual were all declined though heavy and feverish with a pain in her limbs and a cough and a sore throat a good night's rest was to cure her entirely and it was with difficulty that elinor prevailed on her when she went to bed to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies,1,1,0.6103466850602661
but the day did not close so auspiciously as it began -- towards the evening marianne became ill again growing more heavy restless and uncomfortable than before her sister however still sanguine was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made and carefully administering the cordials prescribed saw her with satisfaction sink at last into a slumber from which she expected the most beneficial effects her sleep though not so quiet as elinor wished to see it lasted a considerable time and anxious to observe the result of it herself she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it mrs jennings knowing nothing of any change in the patient went unusually early to bed her maid who was one of the principal nurses was recreating herself in the housekeeper's room and elinor remained alone with marianne,1,1,0.9864963957366022
he meanwhile whatever he might feel acted with all the firmness of a collected mind made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return not a moment was lost in delay of any kind the horses arrived even before they were expected and colonel brandon only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear hurried into the carriage it was then about twelve o'clock and she returned to her sister's apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary and to watch by her the rest of the night it was a night of almost equal suffering to both hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on marianne's side and in the most cruel anxiety on elinor's before mr harris appeared her apprehensions once raised paid by their excess for all her former security and the servant who sat up with her for she would not allow mrs jennings to be called only tortured her more by hints of what her mistress had always thought,1,1,0.9877880065217238
she was on the point of sending again for mr harris or if he could not come for some other advice when the former -- but not till after five o'clock -- arrived his opinion however made some little amends for his delay for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient he would not allow the danger to be material and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure with a confidence which in a lesser degree was communicated to elinor he promised to call again in the course of three or four hours and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them,1,1,0.9759345662154317
about noon however she began -- but with a caution -- a dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent even to her friend -- to fancy to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her sister's pulse -- she waited watched and examined it again and again -- and at last with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness than all her foregoing distress ventured to communicate her hopes mrs jennings though forced on examination to acknowledge a temporary revival tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance -- and elinor conning over every injunction of distrust told herself likewise not to hope but it was too late hope had already entered and feeling all its anxious flutter she bent over her sister to watch -- she hardly knew for what half an hour passed away and the favourable symptom yet blessed her others even arose to confirm it her breath her skin her lips all flattered elinor with signs of amendment and marianne fixed her eyes on her with a rational though languid gaze anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of mr harris at four o'clock -- when his assurances his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation gave her confidence comfort and tears of joy,1,1,0.9940730517448695
she continued by the side of her sister with little intermission the whole afternoon calming every fear satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits supplying every succour and watching almost every look and every breath the possibility of a relapse would of course in some moments occur to remind her of what anxiety was -- but when she saw on her frequent and minute examination that every symptom of recovery continued and saw marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet steady and to all appearance comfortable sleep she silenced every doubt,1,1,0.8985749103868231
mr willoughby i advise you at present to return to combe -- i am not at leisure to remain with you longer -- whatever your business may be with me will it be better recollected and explained to-morrow,1,1,0.9409711060184158
i understand you he replied with an expressive smile and a voice perfectly calm yes i am very drunk -- a pint of porter with my cold beef at marlborough was enough to over-set me,1,0,0.43881116644802226
the steadiness of his manner and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke convincing elinor that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to cleveland he was not brought there by intoxication she said after a moment's recollection,1,1,0.9252204253507623
i mean -- said he with serious energy -- if i can to make you hate me one degree less than you do now i mean to offer some kind of explanation some kind of apology for the past to open my whole heart to you and by convincing you that though i have been always a blockhead i have not been always a rascal to obtain something like forgiveness from ma -- from your sister,1,1,0.7302061403224055
if that is all you may be satisfied already -- for marianne does -- she has long forgiven you,1,1,0.8831235491241123
you did then said elinor a little softened believe yourself at one time attached to her,1,1,0.8875914540436726
why did you call mr willoughby said elinor reproachfully a note would have answered every purpose -- why was it necessary to call,1,1,0.7881711414267367
it was necessary to my own pride i could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you or the rest of the neighbourhood to suspect any part of what had really passed between mrs smith and myself -- and i resolved therefore on calling at the cottage in my way to honiton the sight of your dear sister however was really dreadful and to heighten the matter i found her alone you were all gone i do not know where i had left her only the evening before so fully so firmly resolved within my self on doing right a few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever and i remember how happy how gay were my spirits as i walked from the cottage to allenham satisfied with myself delighted with every body but in this our last interview of friendship i approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling her sorrow her disappointment her deep regret when i told her that i was obliged to leave devonshire so immediately -- i never shall forget it -- united too with such reliance such confidence in me -- oh god -- what a hard-hearted rascal i was,1,1,0.9902939983602211
well sir said elinor who though pitying him grew impatient for his departure and this is all,1,1,0.7189817246220418
elinor's heart which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation was now softened again -- yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last,1,1,0.8637505501717768
but the letter mr willoughby your own letter have you any thing to say about that,1,1,0.9458585746573414
do not talk to me of my wife said he with a heavy sigh -- she does not deserve your compassion -- she knew i had no regard for her when we married -- well married we were and came down to combe magna to be happy and afterwards returned to town to be gay -- and now do you pity me miss dashwood -- or have i said all this to no purpose -- am i -- be it only one degree -- am i less guilty in your opinion than i was before -- my intentions were not always wrong have i explained away any part of my guilt,1,1,0.9816892373065877
last night in drury lane lobby i ran against sir john middleton and when he saw who i was -- for the first time these two months -- he spoke to me -- that he had cut me ever since my marriage i had seen without surprise or resentment now however his good-natured honest stupid soul full of indignation against me and concern for your sister could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to -- though probably he did not think it would -- vex me horridly as bluntly as he could speak it therefore he told me that marianne dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at cleveland -- a letter that morning received from mrs jennings declared her danger most imminent -- the palmers are all gone off in a fright c -- i was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning sir john his heart was softened in seeing mine suffer and so much of his ill-will was done away that when we parted he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy what i felt on hearing that your sister was dying -- and dying too believing me the greatest villain upon earth scorning hating me in her latest moments -- for how could i tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed one person i was sure would represent me as capable of any thing -- what i felt was dreadful -- my resolution was soon made and at eight o'clock this morning i was in my carriage now you know all,1,1,0.9773116826783403
no -- to combe magna i have business there from thence to town in a day or two good bye,1,1,0.7048591892466924
her daughter feeling by turns both pleased and pained surprised and not surprised was all silent attention,1,1,0.8235400254635303
oh my love i could not then talk of hope to him or to myself marianne might at that moment be dying but he did not ask for hope or encouragement his was an involuntary confidence an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend -- not an application to a parent yet after a time i did say for at first i was quite overcome -- that if she lived as i trusted she might my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage and since our arrival since our delightful security i have repeated it to him more fully have given him every encouragement in my power time a very little time i tell him will do everything -- marianne's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as willoughby -- his own merits must soon secure it,1,1,0.9716986221607029
no -- he thinks marianne's affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time and even supposing her heart again free is too diffident of himself to believe that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her there however he is quite mistaken his age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and principles fixed -- and his disposition i am well convinced is exactly the very one to make your sister happy and his person his manners too are all in his favour my partiality does not blind me he certainly is not so handsome as willoughby -- but at the same time there is something much more pleasing in his countenance -- there was always a something -- if you remember -- in willoughby's eyes at times which i did not like,1,1,0.9815698993022086
elinor could not remember it -- but her mother without waiting for her assent continued,1,1,0.8777906787440941
mrs dashwood not less watchful of what passed than her daughter but with a mind very differently influenced and therefore watching to very different effect saw nothing in the colonel's behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self-evident sensations while in the actions and words of marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned,1,1,0.9869755978512949
the dashwoods were two days on the road and marianne bore her journey on both without essential fatigue every thing that the most zealous affection the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable was the office of each watchful companion and each found their reward in her bodily ease and her calmness of spirits to elinor the observation of the latter was particularly grateful she who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering oppressed by anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of nor fortitude to conceal now saw with a joy which no other could equally share an apparent composure of mind which in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness,1,1,0.9852143515716911
as for regret said marianne i have done with that as far as he is concerned i do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him but what they are now -- at present if i could be satisfied on one point if i could be allowed to think that he was not always acting a part not always deceiving me -- but above all if i could be assured that he never was so very wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him since the story of that unfortunate girl --,1,1,0.9147891164443918
elinor said no more she was debating within herself on the eligibility of beginning her story directly or postponing it till marianne were in stronger health -- and they crept on for a few minutes in silence,1,1,0.8474182900211055
here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit and elinor impatient to soothe though too honest to flatter gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved marianne pressed her hand and replied,1,1,0.9353390797417692
had mrs dashwood like her daughter heard willoughby's story from himself -- had she witnessed his distress and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner it is probable that her compassion would have been greater but it was neither in elinor's power nor in her wish to rouse such feelings in another by her retailed explanation as had at first been called forth in herself reflection had given calmness to her judgment and sobered her own opinion of willoughby's deserts -- she wished therefore to declare only the simple truth and lay open such facts as were really due to his character without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray,1,1,0.9957522086722856
in the evening when they were all three together marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again -- but that it was not without an effort the restless unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting -- her rising colour as she spoke -- and her unsteady voice plainly shewed,1,1,0.8527252626616642
one observation may i think be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all willoughby's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue in his behaviour to eliza williams that crime has been the origin of every lesser one and of all his present discontents,1,1,0.8088169144859486
i suppose you know ma'am that mr ferrars is married,1,1,0.9547966860210904
the servant who saw only that miss marianne was taken ill had sense enough to call one of the maids who with mrs dashwood's assistance supported her into the other room by that time marianne was rather better and her mother leaving her to the care of margaret and the maid returned to elinor who though still much disordered had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of thomas as to the source of his intelligence mrs dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself and elinor had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it,1,1,0.9959660179512526
yes ma'am she smiled and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts she was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady and very civil behaved so i made free to wish her joy,1,1,0.8287997527822466
yes ma'am she said how she was very well and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady -- and she seemed vastly contented,1,1,0.9073444365188146
elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in london would write to them to announce the event and give farther particulars -- but day after day passed off and brought no letter no tidings though uncertain that any one were to blame she found fault with every absent friend they were all thoughtless or indolent,1,1,0.9371592950979962
when do you write to colonel brandon ma'am was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on,1,1,0.8814197665752177
he coloured and stammered out an unintelligible reply elinor's lips had moved with her mother's and when the moment of action was over she wished that she had shaken hands with him too but it was then too late and with a countenance meaning to be open she sat down again and talked of the weather,1,1,0.7356246344600335
at longstaple he replied with an air of surprise -- no my mother is in town,1,1,0.6006928875776953
yes said he they were married last week and are now at dawlish,1,1,0.6922753998111756
how soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution however how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred in what manner he expressed himself and how he was received need not be particularly told this only need be said -- that when they all sat down to table at four o'clock about three hours after his arrival he had secured his lady engaged her mother's consent and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover but in the reality of reason and truth one of the happiest of men his situation indeed was more than commonly joyful he had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart and raise his spirits he was released without any reproach to himself from an entanglement which had long formed his misery from a woman whom he had long ceased to love -- and elevated at once to that security with another which he must have thought of almost with despair as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire he was brought not from doubt or suspense but from misery to happiness -- and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine flowing grateful cheerfulness as his friends had never witnessed in him before,1,1,0.973102318236156
the change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the dashwoods was such -- so great -- as promised them all the satisfaction of a sleepless night mrs dashwood too happy to be comfortable knew not how to love edward nor praise elinor enough how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together and yet enjoy as she wished the sight and society of both,1,1,0.9850669275930231
edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing that perhaps at first accidentally meeting the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other as to lead by degrees to all the rest elinor remembered what robert had told her in harley street of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother's affairs might have done if applied to in time she repeated it to edward,1,1,0.9695582119252648
i have burnt all your letters and will return your picture the first opportunity please to destroy my scrawls -- but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep,1,0,0.2784781313241902
one question after this only remained undecided between them one difficulty only was to be overcome they were brought together by mutual affection with the warmest approbation of their real friends their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain -- and they only wanted something to live upon edward had two thousand pounds and elinor one which with delaford living was all that they could call their own for it was impossible that mrs dashwood should advance anything and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life,1,1,0.9827167653007253
mr dashwood's strains were more solemn mrs ferrars was the most unfortunate of women -- poor fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility -- and he considered the existence of each under such a blow with grateful wonder robert's offence was unpardonable but lucy's was infinitely worse neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to mrs ferrars and even if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter nor be permitted to appear in her presence the secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime because had any suspicion of it occurred to the others proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage and he called on elinor to join with him in regretting that lucy's engagement with edward had not rather been fulfilled than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family -- he thus continued,1,1,0.9964061773507497
it was as much however as was desired and more than was expected by edward and elinor and mrs ferrars herself by her shuffling excuses seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more,1,1,0.9894608866779012
the first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the mansion-house from whence they could superintend the progress of the parsonage and direct every thing as they liked on the spot -- could chuse papers project shrubberies and invent a sweep mrs jennings's prophecies though rather jumbled together were chiefly fulfilled for she was able to visit edward and his wife in their parsonage by michaelmas and she found in elinor and her husband as she really believed one of the happiest couples in the world they had in fact nothing to wish for but the marriage of colonel brandon and marianne and rather better pasturage for their cows,1,1,0.9856554989547944
colonel brandon was now as happy as all those who best loved him believed he deserved to be -- in marianne he was consoled for every past affliction -- her regard and her society restored his mind to animation and his spirits to cheerfulness and that marianne found her own happiness in forming his was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend marianne could never love by halves and her whole heart became in time as much devoted to her husband as it had once been to willoughby,1,1,0.9961708443131938

stories to tell to children by sara cone bryant 1918 two little riddles in rhyme there's a garden that i ken full of little gentlemen little caps of blue they wear and green ribbons very fair flax from house to house he goes a messenger small and slight and whether it rains or snows he sleeps outside in the night the path the little yellow tulip once there was a little yellow tulip and she lived down in a little dark house under the ground one day she was sitting there all by herself and it was very still suddenly she heard a little tap tap tap at the door who is that she said it's the rain and i want to come in said a soft sad little voice no you can't come in the little tulip said by and by she heard another little tap tap tap on the window-pane who is there she said the same soft little voice answered it's the rain and i want to come in no you can't come in said the little tulip then it was very still for a long time at last there came a little rustling whispering sound all round the window rustle whisper whisper who is there said the little tulip it's the sunshine said a little soft cheery voice and i want to come in n -- no said the little tulip you can't come in and she sat still again pretty soon she heard the sweet little rustling noise at the keyhole who is there she said it's the sunshine said the cheery little voice and i want to come in i want to come in no no said the little tulip you cannot come in by and by as she sat so still she heard tap tap tap and rustle whisper rustle up and down the window-pane and on the door and at the keyhole who is there she said it's the rain and the sun the rain and the sun said two little voices together and we want to come in we want to come in we want to come in dear dear said the little tulip if there are two of you i s'pose i shall have to let you in so she opened the door a little wee crack and in they came and one took one of her little hands and the other took her other little hand and they ran ran ran with her right up to the top of the ground then they said -- poke your head through so she poked her head through and she was in the midst of a beautiful garden it was early springtime and few other flowers were to be seen but she had the birds to sing to her and the sun to shine upon her pretty yellow head she was so pleased too when the children exclaimed with pleasure that now they knew that the beautiful spring had come the cock-a-doo-dle-doo a very little boy made this story up out of his head and told it to his papa i think you littlest ones will like it i do once upon a time there was a little boy and he wanted to be a cock-a-doo-dle-doo so he was a cock-a-doo-dle-doo and he wanted to fly up into the sky so he did fly up into the sky and he wanted to get wings and a tail so he did get some wings and a tail the cloud one hot summer morning a little cloud rose out of the sea and floated lightly and happily across the blue sky far below lay the earth brown dry and desolate from drought the little cloud could see the poor people of the earth working and suffering in the hot fields while she herself floated on the morning breeze hither and thither without a care oh if i could only help the poor people down there she thought if i could but make their work easier or give the hungry ones food or the thirsty a drink and as the day passed and the cloud became larger this wish to do something for the people of earth was ever greater in her heart on earth it grew hotter and hotter the sun burned down so fiercely that the people were fainting in its rays it seemed as if they must die of heat and yet they were obliged to go on with their work for they were very poor sometimes they stood and looked up at the cloud as if they were praying and saying ah if you could help us i will help you i will said the cloud and she began to sink softly down toward the earth but suddenly as she floated down she remembered something which had been told her when she was a tiny cloud-child in the lap of mother ocean it had been whispered that if the clouds go too near the earth they die when she remembered this she held herself from sinking and swayed here and there on the breeze thinking -- thinking but at last she stood quite still and spoke boldly and proudly she said men of earth i will help you come what may the thought made her suddenly marvellously big and strong and powerful never had she dreamed that she could be so big like a mighty angel of blessing she stood above the earth and lifted her head and spread her wings far over the fields and woods she was so great so majestic that men and animals were awe-struck at the sight the trees and the grasses bowed before her yet all the earth-creatures felt that she meant them well yes i will help you cried the cloud once more take me to yourselves i will give my life for you as she said the words a wonderful light glowed from her heart the sound of thunder rolled through the sky and a love greater than words can tell filled the cloud down down close to the earth she swept and gave up her life in a blessed healing shower of rain that rain was the cloud's great deed it was her death too but it was also her glory over the whole country-side as far as the rain fell a lovely rainbow sprang its arch and all the brightest rays of heaven made its colours it was the last greeting of a love so great that it sacrificed itself soon that too was gone but long long afterward the men and animals who were saved by the cloud kept her blessing in their hearts the little red hen the little red hen was in the farmyard with her chickens when she found a grain of wheat who will plant this wheat she said not i said the goose not i said the duck i will then said the little red hen and she planted the grain of wheat when the wheat was ripe she said who will take this wheat to the mill not i said the goose not i said the duck i will then said the little red hen and she took the wheat to the mill when she brought the flour home she said who will make some bread with this flour not i said the goose not i said the duck i will then said the little red hen when the bread was baked she said who will eat this bread i will said the goose i will said the duck no you won't said the little red hen i shall eat it myself cluck cluck and she called her chickens to help her the gingerbread man once upon a time there was a little old woman and a little old man and they lived all alone in a little old house they hadn't any little girls or any little boys at all so one day the little old woman made a boy out of gingerbread she made him a chocolate jacket and put raisins on it for buttons his eyes were made of fine fat currants his mouth was made of rose-coloured sugar and he had a gay little cap of orange sugar-candy when the little old woman had rolled him out and dressed him up and pinched his gingerbread shoes into shape she put him in a pan then she put the pan in the oven and shut the door and she thought now i shall have a little boy of my own when it was time for the gingerbread boy to be done she opened the oven door and pulled out the pan out jumped the little gingerbread boy on to the floor and away he ran out of the door and down the street the little old woman and the little old man ran after him as fast as they could but he just laughed and shouted -- run run as fast as you can you can't catch me i'm the gingerbread man and they couldn't catch him the little gingerbread boy ran on and on until he came to a cow by the roadside stop little gingerbread boy said the cow i want to eat you the little gingerbread boy laughed and said -- i have run away from a little old woman and a little old man and i can run away from you i can and as the cow chased him he looked over his shoulder and cried -- run run as fast as you can you can't catch me i'm the gingerbread man and the cow couldn't catch him the little gingerbread boy ran on and on and on till he came to a horse in the pasture please stop little gingerbread boy said the horse you look very good to eat but the little gingerbread boy laughed out loud oho oho he said -- i have run away from a little old woman a little old man a cow and i can run away from you i can and as the horse chased him he looked over his shoulder and cried -- run run as fast as you can you can't catch me i'm the gingerbread man and the horse couldn't catch him by and by the little gingerbread boy came to a barn full of threshers when the threshers smelt the gingerbread boy they tried to pick him up and said don't run so fast little gingerbread boy you look very good to eat but the little gingerbread boy ran harder than ever and as he ran he cried out -- i have run away from a little old woman a little old man a cow a horse and i can run away from you i can and when he found that he was ahead of the threshers he turned and shouted back to them -- run run as fast as you can you can't catch me i'm the gingerbread man and the threshers couldn't catch him then the little gingerbread boy ran faster than ever he ran and ran until he came to a field full of mowers when the mowers saw how fine he looked they ran after him calling out wait a bit wait a bit little gingerbread boy we wish to eat you but the little gingerbread boy laughed harder than ever and ran like the wind oho oho he said -- i have run away from a little old woman a little old man a cow a horse a barn full of threshers and i can run away from you i can and when he found that he was ahead of the mowers he turned and shouted back to them -- run run as fast as you can you can't catch me i'm the gingerbread man and the mowers couldn't catch him by this time the little gingerbread boy was so proud that he didn't think anybody could catch him pretty soon he saw a fox coming across a field the fox looked at him and began to run but the little gingerbread boy shouted across to him you can't catch me the fox began to run faster and the little gingerbread boy ran faster and as he ran he chuckled -- i have run away from a little old woman a little old man a cow a horse a barn full of threshers a field full of mowers and i can run away from you i can run run as fast as you can you can't catch me i'm the gingerbread man why said the fox i would not catch you if i could i would not think of disturbing you just then the little gingerbread boy came to a river he could not swim across and he wanted to keep running away from the cow and the horse and the people jump on my tail and i will take you across said the fox so the little gingerbread boy jumped on the fox's tail and the fox began to swim the river when he was a little way from the bank he turned his head and said you are too heavy on my tail little gingerbread boy i fear i shall let you get wet jump on my back the little gingerbread boy jumped on his back a little farther out the fox said i am afraid the water will cover you there jump on my shoulder the little gingerbread boy jumped on his shoulder in the middle of the stream the fox said oh dear little gingerbread boy my shoulder is sinking jump on my nose and i can hold you out of water so the little gingerbread boy jumped on his nose the minute the fox reached the bank he threw back his head and gave a snap dear me said the little gingerbread boy i am a quarter gone the next minute he said why i am half gone the next minute he said my goodness gracious i am three quarters gone and after that the little gingerbread boy never said anything more at all the little jackals and the lion once there was a great big jungle and in the jungle there was a great big lion and the lion was king of the jungle whenever he wanted anything to eat all he had to do was to come up out of his cave in the stones and earth and roar when he had roared a few times all the little people of the jungle were so frightened that they came out of their holes and hiding-places and ran this way and that to get away then of course the lion could see where they were and he pounced on them killed them and gobbled them up he did this so often that at last there was not a single thing left alive in the jungle besides the lion except two little jackals -- a little father jackal and a little mother jackal they had run away so many times that they were quite thin and very tired and they could not run so fast any more and one day the lion was so near that the little mother jackal grew frightened she said -- oh father jackal father jackal i b'lieve our time has come the lion will surely catch us this time pooh nonsense mother said the little father jackal come we'll run on a bit and they ran ran ran very fast and the lion did not catch them that time but at last a day came when the lion was nearer still and the little mother jackal was frightened almost to death oh father jackal father jackal she cried i'm sure our time has come the lion's going to eat us this time now mother don't you fret said the little father jackal you do just as i tell you and it will be all right then what did those cunning little jackals do but take hold of hands and run up towards the lion as if they had meant to come all the time when he saw them coming he stood up and roared in a terrible voice -- you miserable little wretches come here and be eaten at once why didn't you come before the father jackal bowed very low indeed father lion he said we meant to come before we knew we ought to come before and we wanted to come before but every time we started to come a dreadful great lion came out of the woods and roared at us and frightened us so that we ran away what do you mean roared the lion there's no other lion in this jungle and you know it indeed indeed father lion said the little jackal i know that is what everybody thinks but indeed and indeed there is another lion and he is as much bigger than you as you are bigger than i his face is much more terrible and his roar far far more dreadful oh he is far more fearful than you at that the lion stood up and roared so that the jungle shook take me to this lion he said i'll eat him up and then i'll eat you up the little jackals danced on ahead and the lion stalked behind they led him to a place where there was a round deep well of clear water they went round on one side of it and the lion stalked up to the other he lives down there father lion said the little jackal he lives down there the lion came close and looked down into the water -- and a lion's face looked back at him out of the water when he saw that the lion roared and shook his mane and showed his teeth and the lion in the water shook his mane and showed his teeth the lion above shook his mane again and growled again and made a terrible face but the lion in the water made just as terrible a one back the lion above couldn't stand that he leaped down into the well after the other lion but of course as you know very well there wasn't any other lion it was only the reflection in the water so the poor old lion floundered about and floundered about and as he couldn't get up the steep sides of the well he was at last drowned and when he was drowned the little jackals took hold of hands and danced round the well and sang -- the lion is dead the lion is dead we have killed the great lion who would have killed us the lion is dead the lion is dead ao ao ao the country mouse and the city mouse once a little mouse who lived in the country invited a little mouse from the city to visit him when the little city mouse sat down to dinner he was surprised to find that the country mouse had nothing to eat except barley and grain really he said you do not live well at all you should see how i live i have all sorts of fine things to eat every day you must come to visit me and see how nice it is to live in the city the little country mouse was glad to do this and after a while he went to the city to visit his friend the very first place that the city mouse took the country mouse to see was the kitchen cupboard of the house where he lived there on the lowest shelf behind some stone jars stood a big paper bag of brown sugar the little city mouse gnawed a hole in the bag and invited his friend to nibble for himself the two little mice nibbled and nibbled and the country mouse thought he had never tasted anything so delicious in his life he was just thinking how lucky the city mouse was when suddenly the door opened with a bang and in came the cook to get some flour run whispered the city mouse and they ran as fast as they could to the little hole where they had come in the little country mouse was shaking all over when they got safely away but the little city mouse said that is nothing she will soon go away and then we can go back after the cook had gone away and shut the door they stole softly back and this time the city mouse had something new to show he took the little country mouse into a corner on the top shelf where a big jar of dried prunes stood open after much tugging and pulling they got a large dried prune out of the jar on to the shelf and began to nibble at it this was even better than the brown sugar the little country mouse liked the taste so much that he could hardly nibble fast enough but all at once in the midst of their eating there came a scratching at the door and a sharp loud miaouw what is that said the country mouse the city mouse just whispered sh and ran as fast as he could to the hole the country mouse ran after you may be sure as fast as he could as soon as they were out of danger the city mouse said that was the old cat she is the best mouser in town -- if she once gets you you are lost this is very terrible said the little country mouse let us not go back to the cupboard again no said the city mouse i will take you to the cellar there is something specially fine there so the city mouse took his little friend down the cellar stairs and into a big cupboard where there were many shelves on the shelves were jars of butter and cheeses in bags and out of bags overhead hung bunches of sausages and there were spicy apples in barrels standing about it smelt so good that it went to the little country mouse's head he ran along the shelf and nibbled at a cheese here and a bit of butter there until he saw an especially rich very delicious-smelling piece of cheese on a queer little stand in a corner he was just on the point of putting his teeth into the cheese when the city mouse saw him stop stop cried the city mouse that is a trap the little country mouse stopped and said what is a trap that thing is a trap said the little city mouse the minute you touch the cheese with your teeth something comes down on your head hard and you're dead the little country mouse looked at the trap and he looked at the cheese and he looked at the little city mouse if you'll excuse me he said i think i will go home i'd rather have barley and grain to eat and eat it in peace and comfort than have brown sugar and dried prunes and cheese -- and be frightened to death all the time so the little country mouse went back to his home and there he stayed all the rest of his life little jack rollaround once upon a time there was a wee little boy who slept in a tiny trundle-bed near his mother's great bed the trundle-bed had castors on it so that it could be rolled about and there was nothing in the world the little boy liked so much as to have it rolled when his mother came to bed he would cry roll me around roll me around and his mother would put out her hand from the big bed and push the little bed back and forth till she was tired the little boy could never get enough so for this he was called little jack rollaround one night he had made his mother roll him about till she fell asleep and even then he kept crying roll me around roll me around his mother pushed him about in her sleep until her slumber became too sound then she stopped but little jack rollaround kept on crying roll around roll around by and by the moon peeped in at the window he saw a funny sight little jack rollaround was lying in his trundle-bed and he had put up one little fat leg for a mast and fastened the corner of his wee shirt to it for a sail and he was blowing at it with all his might and saying roll around roll around slowly slowly the little trundle-bed boat began to move it sailed along the floor and up the wall and across the ceiling and down again more more cried little jack rollaround and the little boat sailed faster up the wall across the ceiling down the wall and over the floor the moon laughed at the sight but when little jack rollaround saw the moon he called out open the door old moon i want to roll through the town so that the people can see me the moon could not open the door but he shone in through the keyhole in a broad band and little jack rollaround sailed his trundle-bed boat up the beam through the keyhole and into the street make a light old moon he said i want the people to see me so the good moon made a light and went along with him and the little trundle-bed boat went sailing down the streets into the main street of the village they rolled past the town hall and the schoolhouse and the church but nobody saw little jack rollaround because everybody was in bed asleep why don't the people come to see me he shouted high up on the church steeple the weather-vane answered it is no time for people to be in the streets decent folk are in their beds then i'll go to the woods so that the animals may see me said little jack come along old moon and make a light the good moon went along and made a light and they came to the forest roll roll cried the little boy and the trundle-bed went trundling among the trees in the great wood scaring up the squirrels and startling the little leaves on the trees the poor old moon began to have a bad time of it for the tree-trunks got in his way so that he could not go so fast as the bed and every time he got behind the little boy called hurry up old moon i want the beasts to see me but all the animals were asleep and nobody at all looked at little jack rollaround except an old white owl and all she said was who are you the little boy did not like her so he blew harder and the trundle-bed boat went sailing through the forest till it came to the end of the world i must go home now it is late said the moon i will go with you make a path said little jack rollaround the kind moon made a path up to the sky and up sailed the little bed into the midst of the sky all the little bright stars were there with their nice little lamps and when he saw them that naughty little jack rollaround began to tease out of the way there i am coming he shouted and sailed the trundle-bed boat straight at them he bumped the little stars right and left all over the sky until every one of them put his little lamp out and left it dark do not treat the little stars so said the good moon but jack rollaround only behaved the worse get out of the way old moon he shouted i am coming and he steered the little trundle-bed boat straight into the old moon's face and bumped his nose this was too much for the good moon he put out his big light all at once and left the sky pitch-black make a light old moon make a light shouted the little boy but the moon answered never a word and jack rollaround could not see where to steer he went rolling criss-cross up and down all over the sky knocking into the planets and stumbling into the clouds till he did not know where he was suddenly he saw a big yellow light at the very edge of the sky he thought it was the moon look out i am coming he cried and steered for the light but it was not the kind old moon at all it was the great mother sun just coming up out of her home in the sea to begin her day's work aha youngster what are you doing in my sky she said and she picked little jack rollaround up and threw him trundle-bed boat and all into the middle of the sea and i suppose he is there yet unless somebody picked him out again how brother rabbit fooled the whale and the elephant one day little brother rabbit was running along on the sand lippety lippety when he saw the whale and the elephant talking together little brother rabbit crouched down and listened to what they were saying this was what they were saying -- you are the biggest thing on the land brother elephant said the whale and i am the biggest thing in the sea if we join together we can rule all the animals in the world and have our way about everything very good very good trumpeted the elephant that suits me we will do it little brother rabbit sniggered to himself they won't rule me he said he ran away and got a very long very strong rope and he got his big drum and hid the drum a long way off in the bushes then he went along the beach till he came to the whale oh please dear strong mr whale he said will you have the great kindness to do me a favour my cow is stuck in the mud a quarter of a mile from here and i can't pull her out but you are so strong and so obliging that i venture to trust you will help me out the whale was so pleased with the compliment that he said yes at once then said the rabbit i will tie this end of my long rope to you and i will run away and tie the other end round my cow and when i am ready i will beat my big drum when you hear that pull very very hard for the cow is stuck very deep in the mud huh grunted the whale i'll pull her out if she is stuck to the horns little brother rabbit tied the rope-end to the whale and ran off lippety lippety till he came to the place where the elephant was oh please mighty and kindly elephant he said making a very low bow will you do me a favour what is it asked the elephant my cow is stuck in the mud about a quarter of a mile from here said little brother rabbit and i cannot pull her out of course you could if you will be so very obliging as to help me -- -- certainly said the elephant grandly certainly then said little brother rabbit i will tie one end of this long rope to your trunk and the other to my cow and as soon as i have tied her tightly i will beat my big drum when you hear that pull pull as hard as you can for my cow is very heavy never fear said the elephant i could pull twenty cows i am sure you could said the rabbit politely only be sure to begin gently and pull harder and harder till you get her then he tied the end of the rope tightly round the elephant's trunk and ran away into the bushes there he sat down and beat the big drum the whale began to pull and the elephant began to pull and in a jiffy the rope tightened till it was stretched as hard as could be this is a remarkably heavy cow said the elephant but i'll fetch her and he braced his forefeet in the earth and gave a tremendous pull dear me said the whale that cow must be stuck mighty tight and he drove his tail deep in the water and gave a marvellous pull he pulled harder the elephant pulled harder pretty soon the whale found himself sliding toward the land the reason was of course that the elephant had something solid to brace against and beside as fast as he pulled the rope in a little he took a turn with it round his trunk but when the whale found himself sliding toward the land he was so provoked with the cow that he dived head first down to the bottom of the sea that was a pull the elephant was jerked off his feet and came slipping and sliding to the beach and into the surf he was terribly angry he braced himself with all his might and pulled his best at the jerk up came the whale out of the water who is pulling me spouted the whale who is pulling me trumpeted the elephant and then each saw the rope in the other's hold i'll teach you to play cow roared the elephant i'll show you how to fool me fumed the whale and they began to pull again but this time the rope broke the whale turned a somersault and the elephant fell over backward at that they were both so ashamed that neither would speak to the other so that broke up the bargain between them and little brother rabbit sat in the bushes and laughed and laughed and laughed the little half-chick there was once upon a time a spanish hen who hatched out some nice little chickens she was much pleased with their looks as they came from the shell one two three came out plump and fluffy but when the fourth shell broke out came a little half-chick it had only one leg and one wing and one eye it was just half a chicken the hen-mother did not know what in the world to do with the queer little half-chick she was afraid something would happen to it and she tried hard to protect it and keep it from harm but as soon as it could walk the little half-chick showed a most headstrong spirit worse than any of its brothers it would not mind and it would go wherever it wanted to it walked with a funny little hoppity-kick hoppity-kick and got along pretty fast one day the little half-chick said mother i am off to madrid to see the king good-bye the poor hen-mother did everything she could think of to keep him from doing so foolish a thing but the little half-chick laughed at her naughtily i'm for seeing the king he said this life is too quiet for me and away he went hoppity-kick hoppity-kick over the fields when he had gone some distance the little half-chick came to a little brook that was caught in the weeds and in much trouble little half-chick whispered the water i am so choked with these weeds that i cannot move i am almost lost for want of room please push the sticks and weeds away with your bill and help me the idea said the little half-chick i cannot be bothered with you i am off to madrid to see the king and in spite of the brook's begging he went away hoppity-kick hoppity-kick a bit farther on the half-chick came to a fire which was smothered in damp sticks and in great distress oh little half-chick said the fire you are just in time to save me i am almost dead for want of air fan me a little with your wing i beg the idea said the little half-chick i cannot be bothered with you i am off to madrid to see the king and he went laughing off hoppity-kick hoppity-kick when he had hoppity-kicked a good way and was near madrid he came to a clump of bushes where the wind was caught fast the wind was whimpering and begging to be set free little half-chick said the wind you are just in time to help me if you will brush aside these twigs and leaves i can get my breath help me quickly ho the idea said the little half-chick i have no time to bother with you i am going to madrid to see the king and he went off hoppity-kick hoppity-kick leaving the wind to smother after a while he came to madrid and to the palace of the king hoppity-kick hoppity-kick the little half-chick skipped past the sentry at the gate and hoppity-kick hoppity-kick he crossed the court but as he was passing the windows of the kitchen the cook looked out and saw him the very thing for the king's dinner she said i was needing a chicken and she seized the little half-chick by his one wing and threw him into a kettle of water on the fire the water came over the little half-chick's feathers over his head into his eyes it was terribly uncomfortable the little half-chick cried out -- water don't drown me stay down don't come so high but the water said little half-chick little half-chick when i was in trouble you would not help me and came higher than ever now the water grew warm hot hotter frightfully hot the little half-chick cried out do not burn so hot fire you are burning me to death stop but the fire said little half-chick little half-chick when i was in trouble you would not help me and burned hotter than ever just as the little half-chick thought he must suffocate the cook took the cover off to look at the dinner dear me she said this chicken is no good it is burned to a cinder and she picked the little half-chick up by one leg and threw him out of the window in the air he was caught by a breeze and taken up higher than the trees round and round he was twirled till he was so dizzy he thought he must perish don't blow me so wind he cried let me down little half-chick little half-chick said the wind when i was in trouble you would not help me and the wind blew him straight up to the top of the church steeple and stuck him there fast there he stands to this day with his one eye his one wing and his one leg he cannot hoppity-kick any more but he turns slowly round when the wind blows and keeps his head toward it to hear what it says the blackberry-bush a little boy sat at his mother's knees by the long western window looking out into the garden it was autumn and the wind was sad and the golden elm leaves lay scattered about among the grass and on the gravel path the mother was knitting a little stocking her fingers moved the bright needles but her eyes were fixed on the clear evening sky as the darkness gathered the wee boy laid his head on her lap and kept so still that at last she leaned forward to look into his dear round face he was not asleep but was watching very earnestly a blackberry-bush that waved its one tall dark-red spray in the wind outside the fence what are you thinking about my darling she said smoothing his soft honey-coloured hair the blackberry-bush mamma what does it say it keeps nodding nodding to me behind the fence what does it say mamma it says she answered 'i see a happy little boy in the warm fire-lighted room the wind blows cold and here it is dark and lonely but that little boy is warm and happy and safe at his mother's knees i nod to him and he looks at me i wonder if he knows how happy he is 'see all my leaves are dark crimson every day they dry and wither more and more by and by they will be so weak they can scarcely cling to my branches and the north wind will tear them all away and nobody will remember them any more then the snow will sink down and wrap me close then the snow will melt again and icy rain will clothe me and the bitter wind will rattle my bare twigs up and down 'i nod my head to all who pass and dreary nights and dreary days go by but in the happy house so warm and bright the little boy plays all day with books and toys his mother and his father cherish him he nestles on their knees in the red firelight at night while they read to him lovely stories or sing sweet old songs to him -- the happy little boy and outside i peep over the snow and see a stream of ruddy light from a crack in the window-shutter and i nod out here alone in the dark thinking how beautiful it is 'and here i wait patiently i take the snow and the rain and the cold and i am not sorry but glad for in my roots i feel warmth and life and i know that a store of greenness and beauty is shut up safe in my small brown buds day and night go again and again little by little the snow melts all away the ground grows soft the sky is blue the little birds fly over crying it is spring it is spring ah then through all my twigs i feel the slow sap stirring 'warmer grow the sunbeams and softer the air the small blades of grass creep thick about my feet the sweet rain helps to swell my shining buds more and more i push forth my leaves till out i burst in a gay green dress and nod in joy and pride the little boy comes running to look at me and cries oh mamma the little blackberry-bush is alive and beautiful and green oh come and see and i hear and i bow my head in the summer wind and every day they watch me grow more beautiful till at last i shake out blossoms fair and fragrant 'a few days more and i drop the white petals down among the grass and lo there are the green tiny berries carefully i hold them up to the sun carefully i gather the dew in the summer nights slowly they ripen they grow larger and redder and darker and at last they are black shining delicious i hold them as high as i can for the little boy who comes dancing out he shouts with joy and gathers them in his dear hand and he runs to share them with his mother saying here is what the patient blackberry-bush bore for us see how nice mamma 'ah then indeed i am glad and would say if i could yes take them dear little boy i kept them for you held them long up to the sun and rain to make them sweet and ripe for you and i nod and nod in full content for my work is done from the window he watches me and thinks there is the little blackberry-bush that was so kind to me i see it and i love it i know it is safe out there nodding all alone and next summer it will hold ripe berries up for me to gather again ' then the wee boy smiled and said he liked the little story his mother took him up in her arms and they went out to supper and left the blackberry-bush nodding up and down in the wind and there it is nodding yet the fairies up the airy mountain down the rushy glen we daren't go a-hunting for fear of little men wee folk good folk trooping all together green jacket red cap and white owl's feather down along the rocky shore some make their home -- they live on crispy pancakes of yellow tide-foam some in the reeds of the black mountain-lake with frogs for their watch-dogs all night awake high on the hilltop the old king sits he is now so old and gray he's nigh lost his wits with a bridge of white mist columbkill he crosses on his stately journeys from slieveleague to rosses or going up with music on cold starry nights to sup with the queen of the gay northern lights they stole little bridget for seven years long when she came down again her friends were all gone they took her lightly back between the night and morrow they thought that she was fast asleep but she was dead with sorrow they have kept her ever since deep within the lake on a bed of flag-leaves watching till she wake by the craggy hillside through the mosses bare they have planted thorn-trees for pleasure here and there is any man so daring as dig them up in spite he shall find their sharpest thorns in his bed at night up the airy mountain down the rushy glen we daren't go a-hunting for fear of little men wee folk good folk trooping all together green jacket red cap and white owl's feather the adventures of the little field mouse once upon a time there was a little brown field mouse and one day he was out in the fields to see what he could find he was running along in the grass poking his nose into everything and looking with his two eyes all about when he saw a smooth shiny acorn lying in the grass it was such a fine shiny little acorn that he thought he would take it home with him so he put out his paw to touch it but the little acorn rolled away from him he ran after it but it kept rolling on just ahead of him till it came to a place where a big oak-tree had its roots spread all over the ground then it rolled under a big round root little mr field mouse ran to the root and poked his nose under after the acorn and there he saw a small round hole in the ground he slipped through and saw some stairs going down into the earth the acorn was rolling down with a soft tapping sound ahead of him so down he went too down down down rolled the acorn and down down down went the field mouse until suddenly he saw a tiny door at the foot of the stairs the shiny acorn rolled to the door and struck against it with a tap quickly the little door opened and the acorn rolled inside the field mouse hurried as fast as he could down the last stairs and pushed through just as the door was closing it shut behind him and he was in a little room and there before him stood a queer little red man he had a little red cap and a little red jacket and odd little red shoes with points at the toes you are my prisoner he said to the field mouse what for said the field mouse because you tried to steal my acorn said the little red man it is my acorn said the field mouse i found it no it isn't said the little red man i have it you will never see it again the little field mouse looked all about the room as fast as he could but he could not see any acorn then he thought he would go back up the tiny stairs to his own home but the little door was locked and the little red man had the key and he said to the poor mouse -- you shall be my servant you shall make my bed and sweep my room and cook my broth so the little brown mouse was the little red man's servant and every day he made the little red man's bed and swept the little red man's room and cooked the little red man's broth and every day the little red man went away through the tiny door and did not come back till afternoon but he always locked the door after him and carried away the key at last one day he was in such a hurry that he turned the key before the door was quite latched which of course didn't lock it at all he went away without noticing -- he was in such a hurry the little field mouse knew that his chance had come to run away home but he didn't want to go without the pretty shiny acorn where it was he didn't know so he looked everywhere he opened every little drawer and looked in but it wasn't in any of the drawers he peeped on every shelf but it wasn't on a shelf he hunted in every closet but it wasn't in there finally he climbed up on a chair and opened a wee wee door in the chimney-piece -- and there it was he took it quickly in his forepaws and then he took it in his mouth and then he ran away he pushed open the little door he climbed up up up the little stairs he came out through the hole under the root he ran and ran through the fields and at last he came to his own house when he was in his own house he set the shiny acorn on the table i expect he set it down hard for all at once with a little snap it opened -- exactly like a little box and what do you think there was a tiny necklace inside it was a most beautiful tiny necklace all made of jewels and it was just big enough for a lady mouse so the little field mouse gave the tiny necklace to his little mouse-sister she thought it was perfectly lovely and when she wasn't wearing it she kept it in the shiny acorn box and the little red man never knew what had become of it because he didn't know where the little field mouse lived another little red hen once upon a time there was a little red hen who lived on a farm all by herself an old fox crafty and sly had a den in the rocks on a hill near her house many and many a night this old fox used to lie awake and think to himself how good that little red hen would taste if he could once get her in his big kettle and boil her for dinner but he couldn't catch the little red hen because she was too wise for him every time she went out to market she locked the door of the house behind her and as soon as she came in again she locked the door behind her and put the key in her apron pocket where she kept her scissors and some sugar candy at last the old fox thought out a way to catch the little red hen early in the morning he said to his old mother have the kettle boiling when i come home to-night for i'll be bringing the little red hen for supper then he took a big bag and slung it over his shoulder and walked till he came to the little red hen's house the little red hen was just coming out of her door to pick up a few sticks for firewood so the old fox hid behind the wood-pile and as soon as she bent down to get a stick into the house he slipped and scurried behind the door in a minute the little red hen came quickly in and shut the door and locked it i'm glad i'm safely in she said just as she said it she turned round and there stood the ugly old fox with his big bag over his shoulder whiff how scared the little red hen was she dropped her apronful of sticks and flew up to the big beam across the ceiling there she perched and she said to the old fox down below you may as well go home for you can't get me can't i though said the fox and what do you think he did he stood on the floor underneath the little red hen and twirled round in a circle after his own tail and as he spun and spun and spun faster and faster and faster the poor little red hen got so dizzy watching him that she couldn't hold on to the perch she dropped off and the old fox picked her up and put her in his bag slung the bag over his shoulder and started for home where the kettle was boiling he had a very long way to go up hill and the little red hen was still so dizzy that she didn't know where she was but when the dizziness began to go off she whisked her little scissors out of her apron pocket and snip she cut a little hole in the bag then she poked her head out and saw where she was and as soon as they came to a good spot she cut the hole bigger and jumped out herself there was a great big stone lying there and the little red hen picked it up and put it in the bag as quick as a wink then she ran as fast as she could till she came to her own little farmhouse and she went in and locked the door with the big key the old fox went on carrying the stone and never knew the difference my but it bumped him well he was pretty tired when he got home but he was so pleased to think of the supper he was going to have that he did not mind that at all as soon as his mother opened the door he said is the kettle boiling yes said his mother have you got the little red hen i have said the old fox when i open the bag you hold the cover off the kettle and i'll shake the bag so that the hen will fall in and then you pop the cover on before she can jump out all right said his mean old mother and she stood close by the boiling kettle ready to put the cover on the fox lifted the big heavy bag up till it was over the open kettle and gave it a shake splash thump splash in went the stone and out came the boiling water all over the old fox and the old fox's mother and they were scalded to death but the little red hen lived happily ever after in her own little farmhouse the story of the little rid hin there was once't upon a time a little small rid

safe jist where she lived before the story of epaminondas and his auntie epaminondas used to go to see his auntie 'most every day and she nearly always gave him something to take home to his mammy one day she gave him a big piece of cake nice yellow rich gold-cake epaminondas took it in his fist and held it all crunched up tight like this and came along home by the time he got home there wasn't anything left but a fistful of crumbs his mammy said -- what you got there epaminondas cake mammy said epaminondas cake said his mammy epaminondas you ain't got the sense you was born with that's no way to carry cake the way to carry cake is to wrap it all up nice in some leaves and put it in your hat and put your hat on your head and come along home you hear me epaminondas yes mammy said epaminondas next day epaminondas went to see his auntie and she gave him a pound of butter for his mammy fine fresh sweet butter epaminondas wrapped it up in leaves and put it in his hat and put his hat on his head and came along home it was a very hot day pretty soon the butter began to melt it melted and melted and as it melted it ran down epaminondas' forehead then it ran over his face and in his ears and down his neck when he got home all the butter epaminondas had was on him his mammy looked at him and then she said -- law's sake epaminondas what you got in your hat butter mammy said epaminondas auntie gave it to me butter said his mammy epaminondas you ain't got the sense you was born with don't you know that's no way to carry butter the way to carry butter is to wrap it up in some leaves and take it down to the brook and cool it in the water and cool it in the water and cool it in the water and then take it on your hands careful and bring it along home yes mammy said epaminondas by and by another day epaminondas went to see his auntie again and this time she gave him a little new puppy-dog to take home epaminondas put it in some leaves and took it down to the brook and there he cooled it in the water and cooled it in the water and cooled it in the water then he took it in his hands and came along home when he got home the puppy-dog was dead his mammy looked at it and she said -- law's sake epaminondas what you got there a puppy-dog mammy said epaminondas a puppy-dog said his mammy my gracious sakes alive epaminondas you ain't got the sense you was born with that ain't the way to carry a puppy-dog the way to carry a puppy-dog is to take a long piece of string and tie one end of it round the puppy-dog's neck and put the puppy-dog on the ground and take hold of the other end of the string and come along home like this all right mammy said epaminondas next day epaminondas went to see his auntie again and when he came to go home she gave him a loaf of bread to carry to his mammy a brown fresh crusty loaf of bread so epaminondas tied a string around the end of the loaf and took hold of the end of the string and came along home like this imitate dragging something along the ground when he got home his mammy looked at the thing on the end of the string and she said -- my laws a-massy epaminondas what you got on the end of that string bread mammy said epaminondas auntie gave it to me bread said his mammy o epaminondas epaminondas you ain't got the sense you was born with you never did have the sense you was born with you never will have the sense you was born with now i ain't gwine tell you any more ways to bring truck home and don't you go see your auntie neither i'll go see her my own self but i'll just tell you one thing epaminondas you see these here six mince pies i done make you see how i done set 'em on the doorstep to cool well now you hear me epaminondas you be careful how you step on those pies yes mammy said epaminondas then epaminondas' mammy put on her bonnet and her shawl and took a basket in her hand and went away to see auntie the six mince pies sat cooling in a row on the doorstep and then -- and then -- epaminondas was careful how he stepped on those pies he stepped imitate -- right -- in -- the -- middle -- of -- every -- one and do you know children nobody knows what happened next the person who told me the story didn't know nobody knows but you can guess the boy who cried wolf there was once a shepherd-boy who kept his flock at a little distance from the village once he thought he would play a trick on the villagers and have some fun at their expense so he ran toward the village crying out with all his might -- wolf wolf come and help the wolves are at my lambs the kind villagers left their work and ran to the field to help him but when they got there the boy laughed at them for their pains there was no wolf there still another day the boy tried the same trick and the villagers came running to help and got laughed at again then one day a wolf did break into the fold and began killing the lambs in great fright the boy ran for help wolf wolf he screamed there is a wolf in the flock help the villagers heard him but they thought it was another mean trick no one paid the least attention or went near him and the shepherd-boy lost all his sheep that is the kind of thing that happens to people who lie even when they tell the truth no one believes them the frog king did you ever hear the old story about the foolish frogs the frogs in a certain swamp decided that they needed a king they had always got along perfectly well without one but they suddenly made up their minds that a king they must have they sent a messenger to jove and begged him to send a king to rule over them jove saw how stupid they were and sent a king who could not harm them he tossed a big log into the middle of the pond at the splash the frogs were terribly frightened and dived into their holes to hide from king log but after a while when they saw that the king never moved they got over their fright and went and sat on him and as soon as they found he really could not hurt them they began to despise him and finally they sent another messenger to jove to ask for a new king jove sent an eel the frogs were much pleased and a good deal frightened when king eel came wriggling and swimming among them but as the days went on and the eel was perfectly harmless they stopped being afraid and as soon as they stopped fearing king eel they stopped respecting him soon they sent a third messenger to jove and begged that they might have a better king -- a king who was worth while it was too much jove was angry at their stupidity at last i will give you a king such as you deserve he said and he sent them a stork as soon as the frogs came to the surface to greet the new king king stork caught them in his long bill and gobbled them up one after another they came bobbing up and one after another the stork ate them he was indeed a king worthy of them the sun and the wind the sun and the wind once had a quarrel as to which was the stronger each believed himself to be the more powerful while they were arguing they saw a traveller walking along the country highway wearing a great cloak here is a chance to test our strength said the wind let us see which of us is strong enough to make that traveller take off his cloak the one who can do that shall be acknowledged the more powerful agreed said the sun instantly the wind began to blow he puffed and tugged at the man's cloak and raised a storm of hail and rain to beat at it but the colder it grew and the more it stormed the tighter the traveller held his cloak around him the wind could not get it off now it was the sun's turn he shone with all his beams on the man's shoulders as it grew hotter and hotter the man unfastened his cloak then he threw it back at last he took it off the sun had won the little jackal and the alligator the little jackal was very fond of shell-fish he used to go down by the river and hunt along the edges for crabs and such things and once when he was hunting for crabs he was so hungry that he put his paw into the water after a crab without looking first -- which you never should do the minute he put in his paw snap -- the big alligator who lives in the mud down there had it in his jaws oh dear thought the little jackal the big alligator has my paw in his mouth in another minute he will pull me down and gobble me up what shall i do what shall i do then he thought suddenly i'll deceive him so he put on a very cheerful voice as if nothing at all were the matter and he said -- ho ho clever mr alligator smart mr alligator to take that old bulrush root for my paw i hope you'll find it very tender the old alligator was hidden away beneath the mud and bulrush leaves and he couldn't see anything he thought pshaw i've made a mistake so he opened his mouth and let the little jackal go the little jackal ran away as fast as he could and as he ran he called out -- thank you mr alligator kind mr alligator so kind of you to let me go the old alligator lashed with his tail and snapped with his jaws but it was too late the little jackal was out of reach after this the little jackal kept away from the river out of danger but after about a week he got such an appetite for crabs that nothing else would do at all he felt that he must have a crab so he went down by the river and looked all around very carefully he didn't see the old alligator but he thought to himself i think i'll not take any chances so he stood still and began to talk out loud to himself he said -- when i don't see any little crabs on the land i generally see them sticking out of the water and then i put my paw in and catch them i wonder if there are any fat little crabs in the water to-day the old alligator was hidden down in the mud at the bottom of the river and when he heard what the little jackal said he thought aha i'll pretend to be a little crab and when he puts his paw in i'll make my dinner of him so he stuck the black end of his snout above the water and waited the little jackal took one look and then he said -- thank you mr alligator kind mr alligator you are exceedingly kind to show me where you are i will have dinner elsewhere and he ran away like the wind the old alligator foamed at the mouth he was so angry but the little jackal was gone for two whole weeks the little jackal kept away from the river then one day he got a feeling inside him that nothing but crabs could satisfy he felt that he must have at least one crab very cautiously he went down to the river and looked all around he saw no sign of the old alligator still he did not mean to take any chances so he stood quite still and began to talk to himself -- it was a little way he had he said -- when i don't see any little crabs on the shore or sticking up out of the water i usually see them blowing bubbles from under the water the little bubbles go puff puff puff and then they go pop pop pop and they show me where the little juicy crabs are so i can put my paw in and catch them i wonder if i shall see any little bubbles to-day the old alligator lying low in the mud and weeds heard this and he thought pooh that's easy enough i'll just blow some little crab-bubbles and then he will put his paw in where i can get it so he blew and he blew a mighty blast and the bubbles rose in a perfect whirlpool fizzing and swirling the little jackal didn't have to be told who was underneath those bubbles he took one quick look and off he ran but as he went he sang -- thank you mr alligator kind mr alligator you are the kindest alligator in the world to show me where you are so nicely i'll breakfast at another part of the river the old alligator was so furious that he crawled up on the bank and went after the little jackal but dear dear he couldn't catch the little jackal he ran far too fast after this the little jackal did not like to risk going near the water so he ate no more crabs but he found a garden of wild figs which were so good that he went there every day and ate them instead of shell-fish now the old alligator found this out and he made up his mind to have the little jackal for supper or to die trying so he crept and crawled and dragged himself over the ground to the garden of wild figs there he made a huge pile of figs under the biggest of the wild fig trees and hid himself in the pile after a while the little jackal came dancing into the garden very happy and free from care -- but looking all around he saw the huge pile of figs under the big fig tree h-m he thought that looks singularly like my friend the alligator i'll investigate a bit he stood quite still and began to talk to himself -- it was a little way he had he said -- the little figs i like best are the fat ripe juicy ones that drop off when the breeze blows and then the wind blows them about on the ground this way and that the great heap of figs over there is so still that i think they must be all bad figs the old alligator underneath his fig pile thought -- bother the suspicious little jackal i shall have to make these figs roll about so that he will think the wind moves them and straight-way he humped himself up and moved and sent the little figs flying -- and his back showed through the little jackal did not wait for a second look he ran out of the garden like the wind but as he ran he called back -- thank you again mr alligator very sweet of you to show me where you are i can't stay to thank you as i should like good-bye at this the old alligator was beside himself with rage he vowed that he would have the little jackal for supper this time come what might so he crept and crawled over the ground till he came to the little jackal's house then he crept and crawled inside and hid himself there in the house to wait till the little jackal should come home by and by the little jackal came dancing home happy and free from care -- but looking all around presently as he came along he saw that the ground was all raked up as if something very heavy had been dragged over it the little jackal stopped and looked what's this what's this he said then he saw that the door of his house was crushed at the sides and broken as if something very big had gone through it what's this what's this the little jackal said i think i'll investigate a little so he stood quite still and began to talk to himself you remember it was a little way he had but loudly he said -- how strange that my little house doesn't speak to me why don't you speak to me little house you always speak to me if everything is all right when i come home i wonder if anything is wrong with my little house the old alligator thought to himself that he must certainly pretend to be the little house or the little jackal would never come in so he put on as pleasant a voice as he could which is not saying much and said -- hullo little jackal oh when the little jackal heard that he was frightened enough for once it's the old alligator he said and if i don't make an end of him this time he will certainly make an end of me what shall i do he thought very fast then he spoke out pleasantly thank you little house he said it's good to hear your pretty voice dear little house and i will be in with you in a minute only first i must gather some firewood for dinner then he went and gathered firewood and more firewood and more firewood and he piled it all up solid against the door and round the house and then he set fire to it and it smoked and burned till it smoked that old alligator to smoked herring the larks in the cornfield there was once a family of little larks who lived with their mother in a nest in a cornfield when the corn was ripe the mother lark watched very carefully to see if there were any sign of the reapers' coming for she knew that when they came their sharp knives would cut down the nest and hurt the baby larks so every day when she went out for food she told the little larks to look and listen very closely to everything that went on and to tell her all they saw and heard when she came home one day when she came home the little larks were much frightened oh mother dear mother they said you must move us away to-night the farmer was in the field to-day and he said 'the corn is ready to cut we must call in the neighbours to help ' and then he told his son to go out to-night and ask all the neighbours to come and reap the corn to-morrow the mother lark laughed don't be frightened she said if he waits for his neighbours to reap the corn we shall have plenty of time to move tell me what he says to-morrow the next night the little larks were quite trembling with fear the moment their mother got home they cried out mother you must surely move us to-night the farmer came to-day and said 'the corn is getting too ripe we cannot wait for our neighbours we must ask our relatives to help us ' and then he called his son and told him to ask all the uncles and cousins to come to-morrow and cut the corn shall we not move to-night don't worry said the mother lark the uncles and cousins have plenty of reaping to do for themselves we'll not move yet the third night when the mother lark came home the baby larks said mother dear the farmer came to the field to-day and when he looked at the corn he was quite angry he said 'this will never do the corn is getting too ripe it's no use to wait for our relatives we shall have to cut this corn ourselves ' and then he called his son and said 'go out to-night and hire reapers and to-morrow we will begin to cut ' well said the mother that is another story when a man begins to do his own business instead of asking somebody else to do it things get done i will move you out to-night a true story about a girl once there were four little girls who lived in a big bare house in the country they were very poor but they had the happiest times you ever heard of because they were very rich in everything except money they had a wonderful wise father who knew stories to tell and who taught them their lessons in such a beautiful way that it was better than play they had a lovely merry kind mother who was never too tired to help them work or watch them play and they had all the great green country to play in there were dark shadowy woods and fields of flowers and a river and there was a big barn one of the little girls was named louisa she was very pretty and ever so strong she could run for miles through the woods and not get tired she had a splendid brain in her little head it liked study and it thought interesting thoughts all day long louisa liked to sit in a corner by herself sometimes and write thoughts in her diary all the little girls kept diaries she liked to make up stories out of her own head and sometimes she made verses when the four little sisters had finished their lessons and had helped their mother wash up and sew they used to go to the big barn to play and the best play of all was theatricals louisa liked theatricals better than anything they made the barn into a theatre and the grown-up people came to see the plays they acted they used to climb up on the hay-loft for a stage and the grown people sat in chairs on the floor it was great fun one of the plays they acted was jack and the beanstalk they had a ladder from the floor to the loft and on the ladder they tied a vine all the way up to the loft to look like the wonderful beanstalk one of the little girls was dressed up to look like jack and she acted that part when it came to the place in the story where the giant tried to follow jack the little girl cut down the beanstalk and down came the giant tumbling from the loft the giant was made out of pillows with a great fierce head of paper and funny clothes another story that they acted was cinderella they made a wonderful big pumpkin out of the wheelbarrow trimmed with yellow paper and cinderella rolled away in it when the fairy godmother waved her wand one other beautiful story they used to play it was the story of pilgrim's progress if you have never heard it you must be sure to read it as soon as you can read well enough to understand the old-fashioned words the little girls used to put shells in their hats for a sign they were on a pilgrimage as the old pilgrims used to do then they made journeys over the hill behind the house and through the woods and down the lanes and when the pilgrimage was over they had apples and nuts to eat in the happy land of home louisa loved all these plays and she made some of her own and wrote them down so that the children could act them but better than fun or writing louisa loved her mother and by and by as the little girl began to grow into a big girl she felt very sad to see her dear mother work so hard she helped all she could with the housework but nothing could really help the tired mother except money she needed money for food and clothes and someone grown up to help in the house but there never was enough money for these things and louisa's mother grew more and more weary and sometimes ill i cannot tell you how much louisa suffered over this at last as louisa thought about it she came to care more about helping her mother and her father and her sisters than about anything else in all the world and she began to work very hard to earn money she sewed for people and when she was a little older she taught some little girls their lessons and then she wrote stories for the papers every bit of money she earned except what she had to use she gave to her dear family it helped very much but it was so little that louisa never felt as if she were doing anything every year she grew more unselfish and every year she worked harder she liked writing stories best of all her work but she did not get much money for them and some people told her she was wasting her time at last one day a publisher asked louisa who was now a woman to write a book for girls louisa was not very well and she was very tired but she always said i'll try when she had a chance to work so she said i'll try to the publisher when she thought about the book she remembered the good times she used to have with her sisters in the big bare house in the country and so she wrote a story and put all that in it she put her dear mother and her wise father in it and all the little sisters and besides the jolly times and the plays she put the sad hard times in -- the work and worry and going without things when the book was written she called it little women and sent it to the publisher and children the little book made louisa famous it was so sweet and funny and sad and real -- like our own lives -- that everybody wanted to read it everybody bought it and much money came from it after so many years little louisa's wish came true she bought a nice house for her family she sent one of her sisters to europe to study she gave her father books but best of all she was able to see to it that the beloved mother so tired and so ill could have rest and happiness never again did the dear mother have to do any hard work and she had pretty things about her all the rest of her life louisa alcott for that was louisa's name wrote many beautiful books after this and she became one of the most famous women of america but i think the most beautiful thing about her is what i have been telling you that she loved her mother so well that she gave her whole life to make her happy my kingdom the little louisa i told you about who wrote verses and stories in her diary used to like to play that she was a princess and that her kingdom was her own mind when she had unkind or dissatisfied thoughts she tried to get rid of them by playing they were enemies of the kingdom and she drove them out with soldiers the soldiers were patience duty and love it used to help louisa to be good to play this and i think it may have helped make her the splendid woman she was afterward maybe you would like to hear a poem she wrote about it when she was only fourteen years old it will help you too to think the same thoughts a little kingdom i possess where thoughts and feelings dwell and very hard i find the task of governing it well for passion tempts and troubles me a wayward will misleads and selfishness its shadow casts on all my words and deeds how can i learn to rule myself to be the child i should honest and brave nor ever tire of trying to be good how can i keep a sunny soul to shine along life's way how can i tune my little heart to sweetly sing all day dear father help me with the love that casteth out my fear teach me to lean on thee and feel that thou art very near that no temptation is unseen no childish grief too small since thou with patience infinite doth soothe and comfort all i do not ask for any crown but that which all may win nor seek to conquer any world except the one within be thou my guide until i find led by a tender hand thy happy kingdom in myself and dare to take command piccola poor sweet piccola did you hear what happened to piccola children dear 'tis seldom fortune such favour grants as fell to this little maid of france 'twas christmas-time and her parents poor could hardly drive the wolf from the door striving with poverty's patient pain only to live till summer again no gifts for piccola sad were they when dawned the morning of christmas-day their little darling no joy might stir st nicholas nothing would bring to her but piccola never doubted at all that something beautiful must befall every child upon christmas-day and so she slept till the dawn was gray and full of faith when at last she woke she stole to her shoe as the morning broke such sounds of gladness filled all the air twas plain st nicholas had been there in rushed piccola sweet half wild never was seen such a joyful child see what the good saint brought she cried and mother and father must peep inside now such a story who ever heard there was a little shivering bird a sparrow that in at the window flew had crept into piccola's tiny shoe how good poor piccola must have been she cried as happy as any queen while the starving sparrow she fed and warmed and danced with rapture she was so charmed children this story i tell to you of piccola sweet and her bird is true in the far-off land of france they say still do they live to this very day the little fir tree when i was a very little girl some one probably my mother read to me hans christian andersen's story of the little fir tree it happened that i did not read it for myself or hear it again during my childhood one christmas day when i was grown up i found myself at a loss for the one more story called for by some little children with whom i was spending the holiday in the mental search for buried treasure which ensued i came upon one or two word-impressions of the experiences of the little fir tree and forthwith wove them into what i supposed to be something of a reproduction of the original the latter part of the story had wholly faded from my memory so that i made up to suit the tastes of my audience afterward i told the story to a good many children at one time or another and it gradually took the shape it has here it was not until several years later that in rereading andersen for other purposes i came upon the real story of the little fir tree and read it for myself then indeed i was amused and somewhat distressed to find how far i had wandered from the text i give this explanation that the reader may know i do not presume to offer the little tale which follows as an adaptation of andersen's famous story i offer it plainly as a story which children have liked and which grew out of my early memories of andersen's the little fir tree once there was a little fir tree slim and pointed and shiny which stood in the great forest in the midst of some big fir trees broad and tall and shadowy green the little fir tree was very unhappy because he was not big like the others when the birds came flying into the woods and lit on the branches of the big trees and built their nests there he used to call up to them -- come down come down rest in my branches but they always said -- oh no no you are too little when the splendid wind came blowing and singing through the forest it bent and rocked and swung the tops of the big trees and murmured to them then the little fir tree looked up and called -- oh please dear wind come down and play with me but he always said -- oh no you are too little you are too little in the winter the white snow fell softly softly and covered the great trees all over with wonderful caps and coats of white the little fir tree close down in the cover of the others would call up -- oh please dear snow give me a cap too i want to play too but the snow always said -- oh no no no you are too little you are too little the worst of all was when men came into the wood with sledges and teams of horses they came to cut the big trees down and carry them away whenever one had been cut down and carried away the others talked about it and nodded their heads and the little fir tree listened and heard them say that when you were carried away so you might become the mast of a mighty ship and go far away over the ocean and see many wonderful things or you might be part of a fine house in a great city and see much of life the little fir tree wanted greatly to see life but he was always too little the men passed him by but by and by one cold winter's morning men came with a sledge and horses and after they had cut here and there they came to the circle of trees round the little fir tree and looked all about there are none little enough they said oh how the little fir tree pricked up his needles here is one said one of the men it is just little enough and he touched the little fir tree the little fir tree was happy as a bird because he knew they were about to cut him down and when he was being carried away on the sledge he lay wondering so contentedly whether he should be the mast of a ship or part of a fine city house but when they came to the town he was taken out and set upright in a tub and placed on the edge of a path in a row of other fir trees all small but none so little as he and then the little fir tree began to see life people kept coming to look at the trees and to take them away but always when they saw the little fir tree they shook their heads and said -- it is too little too little until finally two children came along hand in hand looking carefully at all the small trees when they saw the little fir tree they cried out -- we'll take this one it is just little enough they took him out of his tub and carried him away between them and the happy little fir tree spent all his time wondering what it could be that he was just little enough for he knew it could hardly be a mast or a house since he was going away with children he kept wondering while they took him in through some big doors and set him up in another tub on the table in a bare little room very soon they went away and came back again with a big basket which they carried between them then some pretty ladies with white caps on their heads and white aprons over their blue dresses came bringing little parcels the children took things out of the basket and began to play with the little fir tree just as he had often begged the wind and the snow and the birds to do he felt their soft little touches on his head and his twigs and his branches when he looked down at himself as far as he could look he saw that he was all hung with gold and silver chains there were strings of white fluffy stuff drooping around him his twigs held little gold nuts and pink rosy balls and silver stars he had pretty little pink and white candles in his arms but last and most wonderful of all the children hung a beautiful white floating doll-angel over his head the little fir tree could not breathe for joy and wonder what was it that he was now why was this glory for him after a time every one went away and left him it grew dusk and the little fir tree began to hear strange sounds through the closed doors sometimes he heard a child crying he was beginning to be lonely it grew more and more shadowy all at once the doors opened and the two children came in two of the pretty ladies were with them they came up to the little fir tree and quickly lighted all the little pink and white candles then the two pretty ladies took hold of the table with the little fir tree on it and pushed it very smoothly and quickly out of the doors across a hall and in at another door the little fir tree had a sudden sight of a long room with many little white beds in it of children propped up on pillows in the beds and of other children in great wheeled chairs and others hobbling about or sitting in little chairs he wondered why all the little children looked so white and tired he did not know that he was in a hospital but before he could wonder any more his breath was quite taken away by the shout those little white children gave oh oh m-m m-m they cried how pretty how beautiful oh isn't it lovely he knew they must mean him for all their shining eyes were looking straight at him he stood as straight as a mast and quivered in every needle for joy presently one little weak child-voice called out -- it's the nicest christmas tree i ever saw and then at last the little fir tree knew what he was he was a christmas tree and from his shiny head to his feet he was glad through and through because he was just little enough to be the nicest kind of tree in the world how moses was saved thousands of years ago many years before david lived there was a very wise and good man of his people who was a friend and adviser of the king of egypt and for love of this friend the king of egypt had let numbers of the israelites settle in his land but after the king and his israelitish friend were dead there was a new king who hated the israelites when he saw how strong they were and how many there were of them he began to be afraid that some day they might number more than the egyptians and might take his land from him then he and his rulers did a wicked thing they made the israelites slaves and they gave them terrible tasks to do without proper rest or food or clothes for they hoped that the hardship would kill off the israelites they thought the old men would die and the young men be so ill and weary that they could not bring up families and so the race would dwindle away but in spite of the work and suffering the israelites remained strong and more and more boys grew up to make the king afraid then he did the most wicked thing of all he ordered his soldiers to kill every boy baby that should be born in an israelitish family he did not care about the girls because they could not grow up to fight very soon after this wicked order a boy baby was born in a certain israelitish family when his mother first looked at him her heart was nearly broken for he was even more beautiful than most babies are -- so strong and fair and sweet but he was a boy how could she save him from death somehow she contrived to keep him hidden for three whole months but at the end of that time she saw that it would not be possible to keep him safe any longer she had been thinking all this time about what she should do and now she carried out her plan first she took a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it all over with pitch so that it was water-tight and then she laid the baby in it then she carried it to the edge of the river and laid it in the flags by the river's brink it did not show at all unless one were quite near it then she kissed her little son and left him there but his sister stood far off not seeming to watch but really watching carefully to see what would happen to the baby soon there was the sound of talk and laughter and a train of beautiful women came down to the water's edge it was the king's daughter come down to bathe in the river with her maidens the maidens walked along by the river side as the king's daughter came near to the water she saw the strange little basket lying in the flags and she sent her maid to bring it to her and when she had opened it she saw the child the poor baby was crying when she saw him so helpless and so beautiful crying for his mother the king's daughter pitied him and loved him she knew the cruel order of her father and she said at once this is one of the hebrews' children at that moment the baby's sister came to the princess and said shall i go and find thee a nurse from the hebrew women so that she may nurse the child for thee not a word did she say about whose child it was but perhaps the princess guessed i don't know at all events she told the little girl to go so the maiden went and brought her mother then the king's daughter said to the baby's mother take this child away and nurse it for me and i will give thee wages was not that a strange thing and can you think how happy the baby's mother was for now the baby would be known only as the princess's adopted child and would be safe and it was so the mother kept him until he was old enough to be taken to the princess's palace then he was brought and given to the king's daughter and he became her son and she named him moses but the strangest part of the whole story is that when moses grew to be a man he became so strong and wise that it was he who at last saved his people from the king and rescued them from the egyptians the one child saved by the king's own daughter was the very one the king would most have wanted to kill if he had known the ten fairies once upon a time there was a dear little girl whose name was elsa elsa's father and mother worked very hard and became rich but they loved elsa so much that they did not like her to do any work very foolishly they let her play all the time so when elsa grew up she did not know how to do anything she could not make bread she could not sweep a room she could not sew a seam she could only laugh and sing but she was so sweet and merry that everybody loved her and by and by she married one of the people who loved her and had a house of her own to take care of then then my dears came hard times for elsa there were so many things to be done in the house and she did not know how to do any of them and because she had never worked at all it made her very tired even to try she was tired before the morning was over every day the maid would come and say how shall i do this or how shall i do that and elsa would have to say i don't know then the maid would pretend that she did not know either and when she saw her mistress sitting about doing nothing she too sat about idle elsa's husband had a hard time of it he had only poor food to eat and it was not ready at the right time and the house looked all in a muddle it made him sad and that made elsa sad for she wanted to do everything just right at last one day elsa's husband went away quite cross he said to her as he went out of the door it is no wonder that the house looks so when you sit all day with your hands in your lap little elsa cried bitterly when he was gone for she did not want to make her husband unhappy and cross and she wanted the house to look nice oh dear she sobbed i wish i could do things right i wish i could work i wish -- i wish i had ten good fairies to work for me then i could keep the house as she said the words a great grey man stood before her he was wrapped in a strange grey cloak that covered him from head to foot and he smiled at elsa what is the matter dear he said why do you cry oh i am crying because i do not know how to keep the house said elsa i cannot make bread i cannot sweep i cannot sew a seam when i was a little girl i never learned to work and now i cannot do anything right i wish i had ten good fairies to help me you shall have them dear said the grey man and he shook his strange grey cloak pouf out hopped ten tiny fairies no bigger than that these shall be your servants elsa said the grey man they are faithful and clever and they will do everything you want them to just right but the neighbours might stare and ask questions if they saw these little chaps running about your house so i will hide them away for you give me your little useless hands wondering elsa stretched out her pretty little white hands now stretch out your little useless fingers dear elsa stretched out her pretty pink fingers the grey man touched each one of the ten little fingers and as he touched them he said their names little thumb forefinger thimble-finger ring-finger little finger little thumb forefinger thimble-finger ring-finger little finger and as he named the fingers one after another the tiny fairies bowed their tiny heads there was a fairy for every name hop hide yourselves away said the grey man hop hop the fairies sprang to elsa's knee then to the palms of her hands and then -- whisk they were all hidden away in her little pink fingers a fairy in every finger and the grey man was gone elsa sat and looked with wonder at her little white hands and the ten useless fingers but suddenly the little fingers began to stir the tiny fairies who were hidden away there were not used to remaining still and they were getting restless they stirred so that elsa jumped up and ran to the cooking table and took hold of the bread board no sooner had she touched the bread board than the little fairies began to work they measured the flour mixed the bread kneaded the loaves and set them to rise quicker than you could wink and when the bread was done it was as nice as you could wish then the little fairy-fingers seized the broom and in a twinkling they were making the house clean and so it went all day elsa flew about from one thing to another and the ten fairies did the work just right when the maid saw her mistress working she began to work too and when she saw how beautifully everything was done she was ashamed to do anything badly herself in a little while the housework was going smoothly and elsa could laugh and sing again there was no more crossness in that house elsa's husband grew so proud of her that he went about saying to everybody my grandmother was a fine housekeeper and my mother was a fine housekeeper but neither of them could hold a candle to my wife she has only one maid but to see the work done you would think she had as many servants as she has fingers on her hands when elsa heard that she used to laugh but she never never told the elves and the shoemaker once upon a time there was an honest shoemaker who was very poor he worked as hard as he could and still he could not earn enough to keep himself and his wife at last there came a day when he had nothing left but one piece of leather big enough to make one pair of shoes he cut out the shoes ready to stitch and left them on the bench then he said his prayers and went to bed trusting that he could finish the shoes on the next day and sell them bright and early the next morning he rose and went to his work bench there lay a pair of shoes beautifully made and the leather was gone there was no sign of anyone having been there the shoemaker and his wife did not know what to make of it but the first customer who came was so pleased with the beautiful shoes that he bought them and paid so much that the shoemaker was able to buy leather enough for two pairs happily he cut them out and then as it was late he left the pieces on the bench ready to sew in the morning but when morning came two pairs of shoes lay on the bench most beautifully made and no sign of anyone who had been there the shoemaker and his wife were quite at a loss that day a customer came and bought both pairs and paid so much for them that the shoemaker bought leather for four pairs with the money once more he cut out the shoes and left them on the bench and in the morning all four pairs were made it went on like this until the shoemaker and his wife were prosperous people but they could not be satisfied to have so much done for them and not know to whom they should be grateful so one night after the shoemaker had left the pieces of leather on the bench he and his wife hid themselves behind a curtain and left a light in the room just as the clock struck twelve the door opened softly and two tiny elves came dancing into the room hopped on to the bench and began to put the pieces together they were quite naked but they had wee little scissors and hammers and thread tap tap went the little hammers stitch stitch went the thread and the little elves were hard at work no one ever worked so fast as they in almost no time all the shoes were stitched and finished then the tiny elves took hold of each other's hands and danced round the shoes on the bench till the shoemaker and his wife had hard work not to laugh aloud but as the clock struck two the little creatures whisked away out of the window and left the room all as it was before the shoemaker and his wife looked at each other and said how can we thank the little elves who have made us happy and prosperous i should like to make them some pretty clothes said the wife they are quite naked i will make the shoes if you will make the coats said her husband that very day they commenced their task the wife cut out two tiny tiny coats of green two weeny weeny waistcoats of yellow two little pairs of trousers of white two bits of caps bright red for every one knows the elves love bright colours and her husband made two little pairs of shoes with long pointed toes they made the wee clothes as dainty as could be with nice little stitches and pretty buttons and by christmas time they were finished on christmas eve the shoemaker cleaned his bench and on it instead of leather he laid the two sets of gay little fairy-clothes then he and his wife hid away as before to watch promptly at midnight the little naked elves came in they hopped upon the bench but when they saw the little clothes there they laughed and danced for joy each one caught up his little coat and things and began to put them on then they looked at each other and made all kinds of funny motions in their delight at last they began to dance and when the clock struck two they danced quite away out of the window they never came back any more but from that day they gave the shoemaker and his wife good luck so that they never needed any more help who killed the otter's babies once the otter came to the mouse-deer and said friend mouse-deer will you please take care of my babies while i go to the river to catch fish certainly said the mouse-deer go along but when the otter came back from the river with a string of fish he found his babies crushed flat what does this mean friend mouse-deer he said who killed my children while you were taking care of them i am very sorry said the mouse-deer but you know i am chief dancer of the war-dance and the woodpecker came and sounded the war-gong so i danced i forgot your children and trod on them i shall go to king solomon said the otter and you shall be punished soon the mouse-deer was called before king solomon did you kill the otter's babies said the king yes your majesty said the mouse-deer but i did not mean to how did it happen said the king your majesty knows said the mouse-deer that i am chief dancer of the war-dance the woodpecker came and sounded the war-gong and i had to dance and as i danced i trod on the otter's children send for the woodpecker said king solomon when the woodpecker came he said to him was it you who sounded the war-gong yes your majesty said the woodpecker but i had to why said the king your majesty knows said the woodpecker that i am chief beater of the war-gong and i sounded the gong because i saw the great lizard wearing his sword send for the great lizard said king solomon when the great lizard came he asked him was it you who were wearing your sword yes your majesty said the great lizard but i had to why said the king your majesty knows said the great lizard that i am chief protector of the sword i wore my sword because the tortoise came wearing his coat of mail so the tortoise was sent for why did you wear your coat of mail said the king i put it on your majesty said the tortoise because i saw the king-crab trailing his three-edged pike then the king-crab was sent for why were you trailing your three-edged pike said king solomon because your majesty said the king-crab i saw that the crayfish had shouldered his lance immediately the crayfish was sent for why did you shoulder your lance said the king because your majesty said the crayfish i saw the otter coming down to the river to kill my children oh said king solomon if that is the case the otter killed the otter's children and the mouse-deer cannot be blamed by the law of the land early i like to lie and wait to see my mother braid her hair it is as long as it can be and yet she doesn't care i love my mother's hair and then the way her fingers go they look so quick and white -- in and out and to and fro and braiding in the light and it is always right so then she winds it shiny brown around her head into a crown just like the day before and then she looks and pats it down and looks a minute more while i stay here all still and cool oh isn't morning beautiful the brahmin the tiger and the jackal do you know what a brahmin is a brahmin is a very good and gentle kind of man who lives in india and who treats all the beasts as if they were his brothers there is a great deal more to know about brahmins but that is enough for the story one day a brahmin was walking along a country road when he came upon a tiger shut up in a strong iron cage the villagers had caught him and shut him up there for his wickedness oh brother brahmin brother brahmin said the tiger please let me out to get a little drink i am so thirsty and there is no water here but brother tiger said the brahmin you know if i should let you out you would spring on me and eat me up never brother brahmin said the tiger never in the world would i do such an ungrateful thing just let me out a little minute to get a little little drink of water brother brahmin so the brahmin unlocked the door and let the tiger out the moment he was out he sprang on the brahmin and was about to eat him up but brother tiger said the brahmin you promised you would not it is not fair or just that you should eat me when i set you free it is perfectly right and just said the tiger and i shall eat you up however the brahmin argued so hard that at last the tiger agreed to wait and ask the first five whom they should meet whether it was fair for him to eat the brahmin and to abide by their decision the first thing they came to to ask was an old banyan tree by the wayside a banyan tree is a kind of fruit tree brother banyan said the brahmin eagerly does it seem to you right or just that this tiger should eat me when i set him free from his cage the banyan tree looked down at them and spoke in a tired voice in the summer he said when the sun is hot men come and sit in the cool of my shade and refresh themselves with the fruit of my branches but when evening falls and they are rested they break my twigs and scatter my leaves and stone my boughs for more fruit men are an ungrateful race let the tiger eat the brahmin the tiger sprang to eat the brahmin but the brahmin said -- wait wait we have asked only one we have still four to ask presently they came to a place where an old bullock was lying by the road the brahmin went up to him and said -- brother bullock oh brother bullock does it seem to you a fair thing that this tiger should eat me up after i have just freed him from a cage the bullock looked up and answered in a deep grumbling voice -- when i was young and strong my master used me hard and i served him well i carried heavy loads and carried them far now that i am old and weak and cannot work he leaves me without food or water to die by the wayside men are a thankless lot let the tiger eat the brahmin the tiger sprang but the brahmin spoke very quickly -- oh but this is only the second brother tiger you promised to ask five the tiger grumbled a good deal but at last he went on again with the brahmin and after a time they saw an eagle high overhead the brahmin called up to him imploringly -- oh brother eagle brother eagle tell us if it seems to you fair that this tiger should eat me up when i have just saved him from a frightful cage the eagle soared slowly overhead a moment then he came lower and spoke in a thin clear voice i live high in the air he said and i do no man any harm yet as often as they find my eyrie men stone my young and rob my nest and shoot at me with arrows men are a cruel breed let the tiger eat the brahmin the tiger sprang upon the brahmin to eat him up and this time the brahmin had very hard work to persuade him to wait at last he did persuade him however and they walked on together and in a little while they saw an old alligator lying half buried in mud and slime at the river's edge brother alligator oh brother alligator said the brahmin does it seem at all right or fair to you that this tiger should eat me up when i have just now let him out of a cage the old alligator turned in the mud and grunted and snorted then he said -- i lie here in the mud all day as harmless as a pigeon i hunt no man yet every time a man sees me he throws stones at me and pokes me with sharp sticks and jeers at me men are a worthless lot let the tiger eat the brahmin at this the tiger was going to eat the brahmin at once the poor brahmin had to remind him again and again that they had asked only four wait till we've asked one more wait until we see a fifth he begged finally the tiger walked on with him after a time they met the little jackal coming gaily down the road toward them oh brother jackal dear brother jackal said the brahmin give us your opinion do you think it right or fair that this tiger should eat me when i set him free from a terrible cage beg pardon said the little jackal i said said the brahmin raising his voice do you think it is fair that the tiger should eat me when i set him free from his cage cage said the little jackal vacantly yes yes his cage said the brahmin we want your opinion do you think -- -- oh said the little jackal you want my opinion then may i beg you to speak a little more loudly and make the matter quite clear i am a little slow of understanding now what was it do you think said the brahmin it is right for this tiger to eat me when i set him free from his cage what cage said the little jackal why the cage he was in said the brahmin you see -- -- but i don't altogether understand said the little jackal you 'set him free ' you say yes yes yes said the brahmin it was this way i was walking along and i saw the tiger -- -- oh dear dear interrupted the little jackal i never can see through it if you go on like that with a long story if you really want my opinion you must make the matter clear what sort of cage was it why a big ordinary cage an iron cage said the brahmin that gives me no idea at all said the little jackal see here my friends if we are to get on with this matter you'd best show me the spot then i can understand in a jiffy show me the cage so the brahmin the tiger and the little jackal walked back together to the spot where the cage was now let us understand the situation said the little jackal friend brahmin where were you i stood just here by the roadside said the brahmin tiger and where were you said the little jackal why in the cage of course roared the tiger oh i beg your pardon father tiger said the little jackal i really am so stupid i cannot quite understand what happened if you will have a little patience -- how were you in the cage what position were you in i stood here said the tiger leaping into the cage with my head over my shoulder so oh thank you thank you said the little jackal that makes it much clearer but i still don't quite understand -- forgive my slow mind -- why did you not come out by yourself can't you see that the door shut me in said the tiger oh i do beg your pardon said the little jackal i know i am very slow i can never understand things well unless i see just how they were if you could show me now exactly how that door works i am sure i could understand how does it shut it shuts like this said the brahmin pushing it to yes but i don't see any lock said the little jackal does it lock on the outside it locks like this said the brahmin and he shut and bolted the door oh does it indeed said the little jackal does it indeed well brother brahmin now that it is locked i should advise you to let it stay locked as for you my friend he said to the tiger i think you will wait a good while before you'll find anyone to let you out again then he made a very low bow to the brahmin good-bye brother he said your way lies that way and mine lies this good-bye the little jackal and the camel all these stories about the little jackal that i have told you show how clever the little jackal was but you know -- if you don't you will when you are grown up -- that no matter how clever you are sooner or later you surely meet some one who is more clever it is always so in life and it was so with the little jackal this is what happened the little jackal was as you know exceedingly fond of shell-fish especially of river crabs now there came a time when he had eaten all the crabs to be found on his own side of the river he knew there must be plenty on the other side if he could only get to them but he could not swim one day he thought of a plan he went to his friend the camel and said -- friend camel i know a spot where the sugar-cane grows thick i'll show you the way if you will take me there indeed i will said the camel who was very fond of sugar-cane where is it it is on the other side of the river said the little jackal but we can manage it nicely if you will take me on your back and swim over the camel was perfectly willing so the little jackal jumped on his back and the camel swam across the river carrying him when they were safely over the little jackal jumped down and showed the camel the sugar-cane field then he ran swiftly along the river bank to hunt for crabs the camel began to eat sugar-cane he ate happily and noticed nothing around him now you know a camel is very big and a jackal is very little consequently the little jackal had eaten his fill by the time the camel had barely taken a mouthful the little jackal had no mind to wait for his slow friend he wanted to be off home again about his business so he ran round and round the sugar-cane field and as he ran he sang and shouted and made a great hullabaloo of course the villagers heard him at once there is a jackal in the sugar-cane they said he will dig holes and destroy the roots we must go down and drive him out so they came down with sticks and stones when they got there there was no jackal to be seen but they saw the great camel eating away at the juicy sugar-cane they ran at him and beat him and stoned him and drove him away half dead when they had gone leaving the poor camel half killed the little jackal came dancing back from somewhere or other i think it's time to go home now he said don't you well you are a pretty friend said the camel the idea of your making such a noise with your shouting and singing you brought this upon me what in the world made you do it why did you shout and sing oh i don't know why said the little jackal -- i always sing after dinner so said the camel ah very well let us go home now he took the little jackal kindly on his back and started into the water when he began to swim he swam out to where the river was the very deepest there he stopped and said -- oh jackal yes said the little jackal i have the strangest feeling said the camel -- i feel as if i must roll over 'roll over' cried the jackal my goodness don't do that if you do that you'll drown me what in the world makes you want to do such a crazy thing why should you want to roll over oh i don't know why said the camel slowly but i always roll over after dinner so he rolled over and the little jackal was drowned for his sins but the camel came safely home the gulls of salt lake the story i am going to tell you is about something that really happened many years ago a brave little company of pioneers from the atlantic coast crossed the mississippi river and journeyed across the plains of central north america in big covered wagons with many horses and finally succeeded in climbing to the top of the great rockies and down again into a valley in the very midst of the mountains it was a valley of brown bare desert soil in a climate where almost no rain falls but the snow on the mountain-tops sent down little streams of pure water the winds were gentle and lying like a blue jewel at the foot of the western hills was a marvellous lake of salt water -- an inland sea so the pioneers settled there and built themselves huts and cabins for the first winter it had taken them many months to make the terrible journey many had died of weariness and illness on the way many died of hardship during the winter and the provisions they had brought in their wagons were so nearly gone that by spring they were living partly on roots dug from the ground all their lives now depended on the crops of grain and vegetables which they could raise in the valley they made the barren land fertile by spreading water from the little streams over it -- what we call irrigating and they planted enough corn and grain and vegetables for all the people every one helped and every one watched for the sprouting with hopes and prayers and careful eyes in good time the seeds sprouted and the dry brown earth was covered with a carpet of tender green growing things no farmer's garden could have looked better than the great garden of the desert valley and from day to day the little shoots grew and flourished till they were all well above the ground then a terrible thing happened one day the men who were watering the crops saw a great number of crickets swarming over the ground at the edge of the gardens nearest the mountains they were hopping from the barren places into the young green crops and as they settled down they ate the tiny shoots and leaves to the ground more came and more and ever more and as they came they spread out till they covered a big corner of the grain field and still more and more till it was like an army of black hopping crawling crickets streaming down the side of the mountain to kill the crops the men tried to kill the crickets by beating them down but the numbers were so great that it was like beating at the sea then they ran and told the terrible news and all the village came to help they started fires they dug trenches and filled them with water they ran wildly about in the fields killing what they could but while they fought in one place new armies of crickets marched down the mountain-sides and attacked the fields in other places and at last the people fell on their knees and wept and cried in despair for they saw starvation and death in the fields a few knelt to pray others gathered round and joined them weeping more left their useless struggles and knelt beside their neighbours at last nearly all the people were kneeling on the desolate fields praying for deliverance from the plague of crickets suddenly from far off in the air toward the great salt lake there was the sound of flapping wings it grew louder some of the people looked up startled they saw like a white cloud rising from the lake a flock of sea gulls flying toward them snow-white in the sun with great wings beating and soaring in hundreds and hundreds they rose and circled and came on the gulls the gulls was the cry what does it mean the gulls flew overhead with a shrill chorus of whimpering cries and then in a marvellous white cloud of outspread wings and hovering breasts they settled down over the cultivated ground oh woe woe cried the people the gulls are eating what the crickets have left they will strip root and branch but all at once someone called out -- no no see they are eating the crickets they are eating only the crickets it was true the gulls devoured the crickets in dozens in hundreds in swarms they ate until they were gorged and then they flew heavily back to the lake only to come again with new appetite and when at last they finished they had stripped the fields of the army of crickets and the people were saved to this day in the beautiful city of salt lake which grew out of that pioneer village the little children are taught to love the sea gulls and when they learn drawing and weaving in the schools their first design is often a picture of a cricket and a gull the nightingale a long long time ago as long ago as when there were fairies there lived an emperor in china who had a most beautiful palace all made of crystal outside the palace was the loveliest garden in the whole world and farther away was a forest where the trees were taller than any other trees in the world and farther away still was a deep wood and in this wood lived a little nightingale the nightingale sang so beautifully that everybody who heard her remembered her song better than anything else that he heard or saw people came from all over the world to see the crystal palace and the wonderful garden and the great forest but when they went home and wrote books about these things they always wrote but the nightingale is the best of all at last it happened that the emperor came upon a book which said this and he at once sent for his chamberlain who is this nightingale said the emperor why have i never heard him sing the chamberlain who was a very important person said there cannot be any such person i have never heard his name the book says there is a nightingale said the emperor i command that the nightingale be brought here to sing for me this evening the chamberlain went out and asked all the great lords and ladies and pages where the nightingale could be found but not one of them had ever heard of him so the chamberlain went back to the emperor and said there is no such person the book says there is a nightingale said the emperor if the nightingale is not here to sing for me this evening i will have the court trampled upon immediately after supper the chamberlain did not want to be trampled upon so he ran out and asked everybody in the palace about the nightingale at last a little girl who worked in the kitchen to help the cook said oh yes i know the nightingale very well every night when i go to carry scraps from the kitchen to my mother who lives in the wood beyond the forest i hear the nightingale sing the chamberlain asked the maid to take him to the nightingale's home and many of the lords and ladies followed after when they had gone a little way they heard a cow moo ah said the lords and ladies that must be the nightingale what a large voice for so small a creature oh no said the little girl that is just a cow mooing a little farther on they heard some bullfrogs in a swamp surely that is the nightingale said the courtiers it really sounds like church-bells oh no said the little girl those are bullfrogs croaking at last they came to the wood where the nightingale was hush said the little girl she is going to sing and sure enough the little nightingale began to sing she sang so beautifully that you have never in all your life heard anything like it dear dear said the courtiers that is very pleasant does that little grey bird really make all that noise she is so pale that i think she has lost her colour for fear of us the chamberlain asked the little nightingale to come and sing for the emperor the little nightingale said she could sing better in her own greenwood but she was so sweet and kind that she came with them that evening the palace was all trimmed with the most beautiful flowers you can imagine and rows and rows of little silver bells that tinkled when the wind blew in and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of wax candles that shone like tiny stars in the great hall there was a gold perch for the nightingale beside the emperor's throne when all the people were there the emperor asked the nightingale to sing then the little grey nightingale filled her throat full and sang and my dears she sang so beautifully that the emperor's eyes filled up with tears and you know emperors do not cry at all easily so he asked her to sing again and this time she sang so marvellously that the tears came out of his eyes and ran down his cheeks that was a great success they asked the little nightingale to sing over and over again and when they had listened enough the emperor said that she should be made singer in chief to the court she was to have a golden perch near the emperor's bed and a little golden cage and was to be allowed to go out twice every day but there were twelve servants appointed to wait on her and those twelve servants went with her every time she went out and each of the twelve had hold of the end of a silken string which was tied to the little nightingale's leg it was not so very much fun to go out that way for a long long time the nightingale sang every evening to the emperor and his court and they liked her so much that the ladies all tried to sing like her they used to put water in their mouths and then make little sounds like this glu-glu-glug and when the courtiers met each other in the halls one would say night and the other would say ingale and that was supposed to be conversation at last one day there came a little package to the emperor on the outside of which was written the nightingale inside was an artificial bird something like a nightingale only it was made of gold and silver and rubies and emeralds and diamonds when it was wound up it played a waltz tune and as it played it moved its little tail up and down everybody in the court was filled with delight at the music of the new nightingale they made it sing that same tune thirty-three times and still they had not had enough they would have made it sing the tune thirty-four times but the emperor said i should like to hear the real nightingale sing now but when they looked about for the real little nightingale they could not find her anywhere she had taken the chance while everybody was listening to the waltz tunes to fly away through the window to her own greenwood what a very ungrateful bird said the lords and ladies but it does not matter the new nightingale is just as good so the artificial nightingale was given the real nightingale's little gold perch and every night the emperor wound her up and she sang waltz tunes to him the people in the court liked her even better than the old nightingale because they could all whistle her tunes -- which you can't do with real nightingales about a year after the artificial nightingale came the emperor was listening to her waltz tune when there was a snap and whir-r-r inside the bird and the music stopped the emperor ran to his doctor but he could not do anything then he ran to his clock-maker but he could not do much nobody could do much the best they could do was to patch the gold nightingale up so that it could sing once a year even that was almost too much and the tune was very shaky still the emperor kept the gold nightingale on the perch in his own room a long time went by and then at last the emperor grew very ill and was about to die when it was sure that he could not live much longer the people chose a new emperor and waited for the old one to die the poor emperor lay quite cold and pale in his great big bed with velvet curtains and tall candlesticks all about he was quite alone for all the courtiers had gone to congratulate the new emperor and all the servants had gone to talk it over when the emperor woke up he felt a terrible weight on his chest he opened his eyes and there was death sitting on his heart death had put on the emperor's gold crown and he had the gold sceptre in one hand and the silken banner in the other and he looked at the emperor with his great hollow eyes the room was full of shadows and the shadows were full of faces everywhere the emperor looked there were faces some were very very ugly and some were sweet and lovely they were all the things the emperor had done in his life good and bad and as he looked at them they began to whisper they whispered do you remember this do you remember that the emperor remembered so much that he cried out loud oh bring the great drum make music so that i may not hear these dreadful whispers but there was nobody there to bring the drum then the emperor cried you little gold nightingale can you not sing something for me i have given you gifts of gold and jewels and kept you always by my side will you not help me now but there was nobody to wind the little gold nightingale up and of course it could not sing the emperor's heart grew colder and colder where death crouched upon it and the dreadful whispers grew louder and louder and the emperor's life was almost gone suddenly through the open window there came a most lovely song it was so sweet and so loud that the whispers died quite away presently the emperor felt his heart grow warm then he felt the blood flow through his limbs again he listened to the song until the tears ran down his cheeks he knew that it was the little real nightingale who had flown away from him when the gold nightingale came death was listening to the song too and when it was done and the emperor begged for more death too said please sing again little nightingale will you give me the emperor's gold crown for a song said the little nightingale yes said death and the little nightingale bought the emperor's crown for a song oh sing again little nightingale begged death will you give me the emperor's sceptre for another song said the little grey nightingale yes said death and the little nightingale bought the emperor's sceptre for another song once more death begged for a song and this time the little nightingale obtained the banner for her singing then she sang one more song so sweet and so sad that it made death think of his garden in the churchyard where he always liked best to be and he rose from the emperor's heart and floated away through the window when death was gone the emperor said to the little nightingale oh dear little nightingale you have saved me from death do not leave me again stay with me on this little gold perch and sing to me always no dear emperor said the little nightingale i sing best when i am free i cannot live in a palace but every night when you are quite alone i will come and sit in the window and sing to you and tell you everything that goes on in your kingdom i will tell you where the poor people are who ought to be helped and where the wicked people are who ought to be punished only dear emperor be sure that you never let anybody know that you have a little bird who tells you everything after the little nightingale had flown away the emperor felt so well and strong that he dressed himself in his royal robes and took his gold sceptre in his hand and when the courtiers came in to see if he were dead there stood the emperor with his sword in one hand and his sceptre in the other and said good-morning margery's garden there was once a little girl named margery who had always lived in the city the flat where her mother and father lived was at the top of a big building and you couldn't see a great deal from the windows except chimney-pots on other people's roofs margery did not know much about trees and flowers but she loved them dearly whenever it was a fine sunday she used to go with her mother and father to the park and look at the lovely flower-beds they seemed always to be finished though and margery was always wishing she could see them grow one spring when margery was nine her father obtained a new situation and they removed to a little house with a nice big piece of ground a short distance outside the town where his new position was margery was delighted and the very first thing she said when her father told her about it was oh may i have a garden may i have a garden margery's mother was almost as eager for a garden as she was and margery's father said he expected to live on their vegetables all the rest of his life so it was soon agreed that the garden should be the first thing attended to behind the cottage were apple trees a plum tree and two or three pear trees then came a stretch of rough grass and then a stone wall with a gate leading into the fields it was on the grass plot that the garden was to be a big piece was to be used for wheat and peas and beans and a little piece at the end was to be given to margery what shall we have in it asked her mother flowers said margery with shining eyes -- blue and white and yellow and pink -- every kind of flower surely flowers said her mother and shall we not have a little salad garden in the middle what is a salad garden margery asked it is a garden where you have all the things that make nice salad said her mother laughing for margery was fond of salads you have lettuce and endive and mustard and cress and parsley and radishes and beetroot and young onions oh how good it sounds said margery i should love a salad garden that very evening margery's father took pencil and paper and drew out a plan for her garden first they talked it all over then he drew what they decided on it looked like the diagram on the next page the outside strip is for flowers said margery's father and next is a footpath all the way round the beds that is to let you get at the flowers to weed and to pick there is a wider path through the middle and the rest is for rows of salad vegetables papa it is glorious said margery papa laughed i hope you will still think it glorious when the weeding time comes he said for you know you and mother have promised to take care of this garden while i take care of the big one i wouldn't not take care of it for anything said margery i want to feel that it is my very own illustration her father kissed her and said it was certainly her very own two evenings after that when margery was called in from her first ramble in the fields she found the postman at the door something for you margery said her mother with the look she had when something nice was happening it was a box quite a big box with a label on it that said -- miss margery brown primrose cottage 21 narcissus road colchester from seeds and plants company reading margery could hardly wait to open it it was filled with little packages all with printed labels and in the packages of course were seeds it made margery dance just to read the names -- nasturtium giant helianthus canariensis calendula canterbury bells more names than i can tell you and other packages bigger that said sweet peas french beans carrots wallflowers and such things margery could almost smell the posies she was so excited only she had seen so little of flowers that she did not know what all the names meant she did not know that a helianthus was a sunflower until her mother told her so and she had never seen the dear blue bell-shaped flowers that always grow in old-fashioned gardens and are called canterbury bells she thought the calendula must be a strange grand flower by its name but her mother told her it was the gay sturdy everydayish little flower called a marigold there was a great deal for a little city girl to be surprised about and it did seem as if morning was a long way off did you think you could plant them in the morning asked her mother you know dear the ground has to be made ready first it takes a little time -- it may be several days before you can plant that was another surprise margery had thought she could begin to sow the seed right off but this was what had happened early the next morning a man came driving up to the cottage with two strong white horses in his wagon was a plough i suppose you have seen ploughs but margery never had and she watched with great interest while the man and her father took the plough from the cart and harnessed the horses to it it was a great three-cornered piece of sharp steel with long handles coming up from it so that a man could hold it in place it looked like this -- illustration i brought a two-horse plough because it's virgin soil the man said margery wondered what in the world he meant it had not been cultivated of course but what had that do with the kind of plough what does he mean father she whispered when she got a chance he means that this land has not been ploughed before it will be hard to turn the soil and one horse could not pull the plough said her father it took the man two hours to plough the little strip of land he drove the sharp end of the plough into the soil and held it firmly so while the horses drew it along in a straight line margery found it fascinating to watch the long line of dark earth and green grass come rolling up and turn over as the knife passed it she could see that it took real skill and strength to keep the line even and to avoid the stones sometimes the plough struck a hidden stone and then the man was jerked almost off his feet but he only laughed and said tough piece of land it will be a lot better next year when he had ploughed the man went back to his cart and unloaded another farm implement this one was like a three-cornered platform of wood with a long curved strong rake under it it was called a harrow and it looked like the diagram on the next page the man harnessed the horses to it and then he stood on the platform and drove all over the strip of land it was fun to watch but perhaps it was a little hard to do the man's weight kept the harrow steady and let the teeth of the rake scratch and cut the ground up so that it did not stay in ridges he scrambles the ground father said margery it needs 'scrambling ' laughed her father we are going to get more weeds than we want on this fresh soil and the more the ground is broken the fewer there will be illustration after the ploughing and harrowing the man drove off and margery's father said that he himself would do the rest of the work in the late afternoons when he came home from business they could not afford too much help he said and he had learned to take care of a garden when he was a boy so margery did not see any more done until the next day but the next day there was hard work for margery's father every bit of that ground had to be broken up still more with a spade and then the clods which were full of grass-roots had to be taken on a fork and shaken till the earth fell out when the grass was thrown to one side that would not have had to be done if the land had been ploughed in the autumn the grass would have rotted in the ground and would have made food for the plants now margery's father put the fertiliser on the top and then raked it into the earth at last it was time to make the place for the seeds margery and her mother helped father tied one end of a cord to a little stake and drove the stake in the ground at one end of the garden then he took the cord to the other end of the garden and pulled it tight tied it to another stake and drove that down that made a straight line then he hoed a trench a few inches deep the whole length of the cord and scattered fertiliser in it pretty soon the whole garden was lined with little trenches now for the seed said father margery ran and brought the seed box may i help she asked if you watch me sow one row i think you can do the next said her father so margery watched her father took a handful of peas and stooping walked slowly along the line letting the seed trickle through his fingers it was pretty to watch it made margery think of a photograph her teacher had a photograph of a famous picture called the sower perhaps you have seen it putting in the seed was not so easy to do as to watch sometimes margery dropped in too much and sometimes not enough but her father was patient with her and soon she did better they planted peas beans spinach carrots and parsnips and margery's father made a row of holes after that for the tomato plants he said those had to be transplanted they could not be sown from seed when the seeds were in the trenches they had to be covered up and margery really helped at that it is fun to do it you stand beside the little trench and walk backward and as you walk you hoe the loose earth back over the seeds the same earth that was hoed up you pull back again then you rake very gently over the surface with the back of a rake to even it all off margery liked it because now the garden began to look like a garden but best of all was the work next day when her own little particular garden was begun father brown loved margery and margery's mother so much that he wanted their garden to be perfect and that meant a great deal more work he knew very well that the old grass would begin to come through again on such soil and that it would make terribly hard weeding he was not going to have any such thing for his two little girls as he called them so he gave that little garden particular attention this is what he did after he had thrown out all the turf he shovelled clean earth on to the garden -- as much as three solid inches of it not a bit of grass was in that then it was ready for raking and fertilising and for the lines the little footpaths were marked out by father brown's feet margery and her mother laughed well at his actions for it looked like some kind of dance mr brown had seen gardeners do it when he was a little boy and he did it very nicely he walked along the sides of the square with one foot turned a little out and the other straight taking such tiny steps that his feet touched each other all the time this tramped out a path just wide enough for a person to walk the wider path was marked with lines and raked margery thought of course all the flowers would be put in as the vegetables were but she found that it was not so for some her father poked little holes with his finger for some he made very shallow trenches and some very small seeds were scattered lightly over the top of the ground margery and her mother had taken so much pains in thinking out the arrangement of the flowers that perhaps you will like to hear just how they designed that garden at the back were the sweet peas which would grow tall like a screen on the two sides for a kind of hedge were yellow sunflowers and along the front edge were the gay nasturtiums margery planned that so that she could look into the garden from the front but have it shut away from the vegetable patch by the tall flowers on the sides the two front corners had canariensis in them canariensis is a pretty creeper with golden blossoms very dainty and bright and then in little square patches all round the garden were planted london pride blue bachelor's buttons yellow marigolds tall larkspur many-coloured asters hollyhocks and stocks all these lovely flowers used to grow in our grandmothers' gardens and if you don't know what they look like i hope you can find out next summer between the flowers and the middle path went the seeds for that wonderful salad garden all the things mrs brown had named to margery were there margery had never seen anything more wonderful than the little round lettuce-seeds they were so tiny that it did not seem possible that green lettuce leaves could come from them but they surely would mother and father and margery were late to supper that evening but they were all so happy that it did not matter the last thing margery thought of as she went to sleep at night was the dear smooth little garden with its funny footpath and with the little sticks standing at the ends of the rows labelled lettuce beets helianthus and so on i have a garden i have a garden was margery's last thought as she went off to dreamland the little cotyledons this is another story about margery's garden the next morning after the garden was planted margery was up and out at six o'clock she could not wait to look at her garden to be sure she knew that the seeds could not sprout in a single night but she had a feeling that something might happen at any moment the garden was just as smooth and brown as the night before and no little seedlings were in sight but a very few mornings after that when margery went out she saw a funny little crack opening up through the earth the whole length of the patch quickly she knelt down on the footpath to see yes tiny green leaves a whole row of them were pushing their way through the crust margery knew what she had put there it was the radish-row these must be radish leaves she examined them very closely so that she might know a radish next time the little leaves no bigger than half your little-finger nail grew in twos -- two on each tiny stem they were almost round margery flew back to her mother to say that the first seeds were up and her mother nearly as excited as margery came to look at the little crack each day after that the row of radishes grew till in a week it stood as high as your finger green and sturdy but about the third day while margery was stooping over the radishes she saw something very very small and green peeping above ground where the lettuce was planted could it be weeds no for on looking very closely she saw that the wee leaves faintly marked a regular row they did not make a crack like the radishes they seemed too small and too far apart to push the earth up like that margery leaned down and looked with all her eyes at the baby plants the tiny leaves grew two on a stem and were almost round the more she looked at them the more it seemed to margery that they looked exactly as the radish looked when it first came up do you suppose margery said to herself that lettuce and radish look alike while they are growing they don't look alike when they are on the table day by day the lettuce grew and soon the little round leaves were easier to examine they certainly were very much like radish leaves then one morning while she was searching for signs of other seeds margery discovered the beets in irregular patches on the row hints of green were coming the next day and the next they grew until the beet leaves were big enough to see margery looked then she looked again then she wrinkled her forehead can we have made a mistake she thought do you suppose we can have planted all radishes for those little beet leaves were almost round and they grew two on a stem precisely like the lettuce and the radish except for the size all three rows looked alike it was too much for margery she ran to the house and found her father her little face was so anxious that he thought something unpleasant had happened papa she said all out of breath do you think we could have made a mistake about my garden do you think we could have put radishes in all the rows father laughed what makes you think such a thing he asked papa said margery the little leaves all look exactly alike every plant has just two tiny leaves on it and shaped the same they are roundish and grow out of the stem at the same place papa's eyes began to twinkle many of the dicotyledonous plants look alike at the beginning he said with a little drawl on the big word that was to tease margery because she always wanted to know the big words she heard what's 'dicotyledonous' said margery carefully wait till i come home to-night dear said her father and i'll tell you that evening margery was waiting eagerly for him when her father finished his supper they went together to the garden and father examined the seedlings carefully then he pulled up a little radish plant and a tiny beet these little leaves he said are not the real leaves of the plant they are only little pockets to hold food for the plant to live on till it gets strong enough to push up into the air as soon as the real leaves come out and begin to draw food from the air these little substitutes wither up and fall off these two lie folded up in the little seed from the beginning and are full of plant food they don't have to be very special in shape you see because they don't stay on the plant after it is grown up then every plant looks like this at first said margery no dear not every one plants are divided into two kinds those which have two food leaves like these plants and those which have only one these are called dicotyledonous and the ones which have but one food leaf are monocotyledonous many of the dicotyledons look alike i think that is interesting said margery i always supposed the plants were different from the minute they began to grow indeed no said father even some of the trees look like this when they first come through you would not think a birch tree could look like a vegetable or a flower would you but it does at first it looks so much like these things that in the great nurseries where trees are raised for forests and parks the workmen have to be very carefully trained or else they would pull up the trees when they are weeding they have to be taught the difference between a birch tree and a weed how funny said margery dimpling yes it sounds funny said father but you see the birch tree is dicotyledonous and so are many weeds and the dicotyledons look so much alike at first i am glad to know that father said margery soberly i believe i shall learn a good deal from living in the country don't you think so margery's father took her in his arms i hope so dear he said the country is a good place for little girls and that was all that happened that day the talkative tortoise once upon a time a tortoise lived in a pond with two ducks who were her very good friends she enjoyed the company of the ducks because she could talk with them to her heart's content the tortoise liked to talk she always had something to say and she liked to hear herself say it after many years of this pleasant living the pond became very low in a dry season and finally it dried up the two ducks saw that they could no longer live there so they decided to fly to another region where there was more water they went to the tortoise to bid her good-bye oh don't leave me behind begged the tortoise take me with you i must die if i am left here but you cannot fly said the ducks how can we take you with us take me with you take me with you said the tortoise the ducks felt so sorry for her that at last they thought of a way to take her we have thought of a way which will be possible they said if only you can manage to keep still long enough we will each take hold of one end of a stout stick and do you take the middle in your mouth then we will fly up in the air with you and carry you with us but remember not to talk if you open your mouth you are lost the tortoise said she would not say a word she would not so much as move her mouth and she was very grateful so the ducks brought a strong little stick and took hold of the ends while the tortoise bit firmly on the middle then the two ducks rose slowly in the air and flew away with their burden when they were above the treetops the tortoise wanted to say how high we are but she remembered and kept still when they passed the church steeple she wanted to say what is that which shines but she remembered and held her peace then they came over the village square and the people looked up and saw them look at the ducks carrying a tortoise they shouted and every one ran to look the tortoise wanted to say what business is it of yours but she didn't then she heard the people shout isn't it strange look at it look the tortoise forgot everything except that she wanted to say hush you foolish people she opened her mouth -- and fell to the ground and that was the end of the tortoise it is a very good thing to be able to hold one's tongue robert of sicily an old legend says that there was once a king named robert of sicily who was brother to the great pope of rome and to the emperor of allemaine he was a very selfish king and very proud he cared more for his pleasures than for the needs of his people and his heart was so filled with his own greatness that he had no thought for god one day this proud king was sitting in his place at church at vesper service his courtiers were about him in their bright garments and he himself was dressed in his royal robes the choir was chanting the latin service and as the beautiful voices swelled louder the king noticed one particular verse which seemed to be repeated again and again he turned to a learned clerk at his side and asked what those words meant for he knew no latin they mean 'he hath put down the mighty from their seats and hath exalted them of low degree ' answered the clerk it is well the words are in latin then said the king angrily for they are a lie there is no power on earth or in heaven which can put me down from my seat and he sneered at the beautiful singing as he leaned back in his place presently the king fell asleep while the service went on he slept deeply and long when he awoke the church was dark and still and he was all alone he the king had been left alone in the church to awake in the dark he was furious with rage and surprise and stumbling through the dim aisles he reached the great doors and beat at them madly shouting for his servants the old sexton heard some one shouting and pounding in the church and thought it was some drunken vagabond who had stolen in during the service he came to the door with his keys and called out who is there open open it is i the king came a hoarse angry voice from within it is a crazy man thought the sexton and he was frightened he opened the doors carefully and stood back peering into the darkness out past him rushed the figure of a man in tattered scanty clothes with unkempt hair and white wild face the sexton did not know that he had ever seen him before but he looked long after him wondering at his wildness and his haste in his fluttering rags without hat or cloak not knowing what strange thing had happened to him king robert rushed to his palace gates pushed aside the startled servants and hurried blind with rage up the wide stair and through the great corridors toward the room where he could hear the sound of his courtiers' voices men and women servants tried to stop the ragged man who had somehow got into the palace but robert did not even see them as he fled along straight to the open doors of the big banquet hall he made his way and into the midst of the grand feast there the great hall was filled with lights and flowers the tables were set with everything that is delicate and rich to eat the courtiers in their gay clothes were laughing and talking and at the head of the feast on the king's own throne sat a king his face his figure his voice were exactly like robert of sicily no human being could have told the difference no one dreamed that he was not the king he was dressed in the king's royal robes he wore the royal crown and on his hand was the king's own ring robert of sicily half naked ragged without a sign of his kingship on him stood before the throne and stared with fury at this figure of himself the king on the throne looked at him who art thou and what dost thou here he asked and though his voice was just like robert's own it had something in it sweet and deep like the sound of bells i am the king cried robert of sicily i am the king and you are an impostor the courtiers started from their seats and drew their swords they would have killed the crazy man who insulted their king but he raised his hand and stopped them and with his eyes looking into robert's eyes he said not the king you shall be the king's jester you shall wear the cap and bells and make laughter for my court you shall be the servant of the servants and your companion shall be the jester's ape with shouts of laughter the courtiers drove robert of sicily from the banquet hall the waiting-men with laughter too pushed him into the soldiers' hall and there the pages brought the jester's wretched ape and put a fool's cap and bells on robert's head it was like a terrible dream he could not believe it true he could not understand what had happened to him and when he woke next morning he believed it was a dream and that he was king again but as he turned his head he felt the coarse straw under his cheek instead of the soft pillow and he saw that he was in the stable with the shivering ape by his side robert of sicily was a jester and no one knew him for the king three long years passed sicily was happy and all things went well under the king who was not robert robert was still the jester and his heart grew harder and more bitter with every year many times during the three years the king who had his face and voice had called him to himself when none else could hear and had asked him the one question who art thou and each time that he asked it his eyes looked into robert's eyes to find his heart but each time robert threw back his head and answered proudly i am the king and the other king's eyes grew sad and stern at the end of three years the pope called the emperor of allemaine and the king of sicily his brothers to a great meeting in his city of rome the king of sicily went with all his soldiers and courtiers and servants -- a great procession of horsemen and footmen never had there been seen a finer sight than the grand train men in bright armour riders in wonderful cloaks of velvet and silk servants carrying marvellous presents to the pope and at the very end rode robert the jester his horse was poor and old many-coloured and the ape rode with him every one in the villages through which they passed ran after the jester and pointed and laughed the pope received his brothers and their trains in the square before saint peter's with music and flags and flowers he made the king of sicily welcome and greeted him as his brother in the midst of it the jester broke through the crowd and threw himself before the pope look at me he cried i am your brother robert of sicily this man is an impostor who has stolen my throne i am robert the king the pope looked at the poor jester with pity but the emperor of allemaine turned to the king of sicily and said is it not rather dangerous brother to keep a madman as jester and again robert was pushed back among the serving-men it was holy week and the king and the emperor with all their trains went every day to the great services in the cathedral something wonderful and holy seemed to make these services more beautiful than ever before all the people of rome felt it it was as if the presence of an angel were there men thought of god and felt his blessing on them but no one knew who it was that brought the beautiful feeling and when easter day came never had there been so lovely so holy a day in the great churches filled with flowers and sweet with incense the kneeling people listened to the choirs singing and it was like the voices of angels their prayers were more earnest than ever before their praise more glad there was something heavenly in rome robert of sicily went to the services with the rest and sat in the humblest place with the servants over and over again he heard the sweet voices of the choirs chant the latin words he had heard long ago he hath put down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted them of low degree and at last as he listened his heart was softened he too felt the strange blessed presence of a heavenly power he thought of god and of his own wickedness he remembered how selfish he had been and how little good he had done he realised that his power had not been from himself at all on easter night as he crept to his bed of straw he wept not because he was so wretched but because he had not been a better king when power was his at last all the festivities were over and the king of sicily went home to his own land again with his people robert the jester came home too on the day of their home-coming there was a special service in the royal church and even after the service was over for the people the monks held prayers of thanksgiving and praise the sound of their singing came softly in at the palace windows in the great banquet room the king sat wearing his royal robes and his crown while many subjects came to greet him at last he sent them all away saying he wanted to be alone but he commanded the jester to stay and when they were alone together the king looked into robert's eyes as he had done before and said softly who art thou robert of sicily bowed his head thou knowest best he said i only know that i have sinned as he spoke he heard the voices of the monks singing he hath put down the mighty from their seat -- and his head sank lower but suddenly the music seemed to change a wonderful light shone all about as robert raised his eyes he saw the face of the king smiling at him with a radiance like nothing on earth and as he sank to his knees before the glory of that smile a voice sounded with the music like a melody throbbing on a single string -- i am an angel and thou art the king then robert of sicily was alone his royal robes were upon him once more he wore his crown and his royal ring he was king and when the courtiers came back they found their king kneeling by his throne absorbed in silent prayer the jealous courtiers i wonder if you have ever heard the anecdote about the artist of duesseldorf and the jealous courtiers this is it it seems there was once a very famous artist who lived in the little town of duesseldorf he did such fine work that the elector prince johann wilhelm ordered a portrait statue of himself on horseback to be done in bronze the artist was overjoyed at the commission and worked early and late at the statue at last the work was done and the artist had the great statue set up in the public square of duesseldorf ready for the opening view the elector came on the appointed day and with him came his favourite courtiers from the castle then the statue was unveiled it was very beautiful -- so beautiful that the prince exclaimed in surprise he could not look enough and presently he turned to the artist and shook hands with him like an old friend herr grupello he said you are a great artist and this statue will make your fame even greater than it is the portrait of me is perfect when the courtiers heard this and saw the friendly hand-shake their jealousy of the artist was beyond bounds their one thought was how could they safely do something to humiliate him they dared not pick flaws in the portrait statue for the prince had declared it perfect but at last one of them said with an air of great frankness indeed herr grupello the portrait of his royal highness is perfect but permit me to say that the statue of the horse is not quite so successful the head is too large it is out of proportion no said another the horse is really not so successful the turn of the neck there is awkward if you would change the right hind-foot herr grupello said a third it would be an improvement still another found fault with the horse's tail the artist listened quietly when they had all finished he turned to the prince and said your courtiers prince find a good many flaws in the statue of the horse will you permit me to keep it a few days more to do what i can with it the elector assented and the artist ordered a temporary screen to be built around the statue so that his assistants could work undisturbed for several days the sound of hammering came steadily from behind the enclosure the courtiers who took care to pass that way often were delighted each one said to himself i must have been right really the artist himself sees that something was wrong now i shall have credit for saving the prince's portrait by my artistic taste once more the artist summoned the prince and his courtiers and once more the statue was unveiled again the elector exclaimed at its beauty and then he turned to his courtiers one after another to see what they had to say perfect said the first now that the horse's head is in proportion there is not a flaw the change in the neck was just what was needed said the second it is very graceful now the rear right foot is as it should be now said a third and it adds so much to the beauty of the whole the fourth said that he considered the tail greatly improved my courtiers are much pleased now said the prince to herr grupello they think the statue much improved by the changes you have made herr grupello smiled a little i am glad they are pleased he said but the fact is i have changed nothing what do you mean said the prince in surprise have we not heard the sound of hammering every day what were you hammering at then i was hammering at the reputation of your courtiers who found fault simply because they were jealous said the artist and i rather think that their reputation is pretty well hammered to pieces it was indeed the elector laughed heartily but the courtiers slunk away one after another without a word prince cherry there was once an old king so wise and kind and true that the most powerful good fairy of his land visited him and asked him to name the dearest wish of his heart that she might grant it surely you know it said the good king it is for my only son prince cherry do for him whatever you would have done for me gladly said the great fairy choose what i shall give him i can make him the richest the most beautiful or the most powerful prince in the world choose none of those things are what i want said the king i want only that he shall be good of what use will it be to him to be beautiful rich or powerful if he grows into a bad man make him the best prince in the world i beg you alas i cannot make him good said the fairy he must do that for himself i can give him good advice reprove him when he does wrong and punish him if he will not punish himself i can and will be his best friend but i cannot make him good unless he wills it the king was sad to hear this but he rejoiced in the friendship of the fairy for his son and when he died soon after he was happy to know that he left prince cherry in her hands prince cherry grieved for his father and often lay awake at night thinking of him one night when he was all alone in his room a soft and lovely light suddenly shone before him and a beautiful vision stood at his side it was the good fairy she was clad in robes of dazzling white and on her shining hair she wore a wreath of white roses i am the fairy candide she said to the prince i promised your father that i would be your best friend and as long as you live i shall watch over your happiness i have brought you a gift it is not wonderful to look at but it has a wonderful power for your welfare wear it and let it help you as she spoke she placed a small gold ring on the prince's little finger this ring she said will help you to be good when you do evil it will prick you to remind you if you do not heed its warnings a worse thing will happen to you for i shall become your enemy then she vanished prince cherry wore his ring and said nothing to anyone of the fairy's gift it did not prick him for a long time because he was good and merry and happy but prince cherry had been rather spoiled by his nurse when he was a child she had always said to him that when he should become king he could do exactly as he pleased now after a while he began to find out that this was not true and it made him angry the first time that he noticed that even a king could not always have his own way was on a day when he went hunting it happened that he got no game this put him in such a bad temper that he grumbled and scolded all the way home the little gold ring began to feel tight and uncomfortable when he reached the palace his pet dog ran to meet him go away said the prince crossly but the little dog was so used to being petted that he only jumped up on his master and tried to kiss his hand the prince turned and kicked the little creature at the instant he felt a sharp prick in his little finger like a pin prick what nonsense said the prince to himself am i not king of the whole land may i not kick my own dog if i choose what evil is there in that a silver voice spoke in his ear the king of the land has a right to do good but not evil you have been guilty of bad temper and of cruelty to-day see that you do better to-morrow the prince turned sharply but no one was to be seen yet he recognised the voice as that of fairy candide he followed her advice for a little but presently he forgot and the ring pricked him so sharply that his finger had a drop of blood on it this happened again and again for the prince grew more self-willed and headstrong every day he had some bad friends too who urged him on in the hope that he would ruin himself and give them a chance to seize the throne he treated his people carelessly and his servants cruelly and everything he wanted he felt that he must have the ring annoyed him terribly it was embarrassing for a king to have a drop of blood on his finger all the time at last he took the ring off and put it out of sight then he thought he should be perfectly happy having his own way but instead he grew more unhappy as he grew less good whenever he was crossed or could not have his own way instantly he flew into a passion finally he wanted something that he really could not have this time it was a most beautiful young girl named zelia the prince saw her and loved her so much that he wanted at once to make her his queen to his great astonishment she refused am i not pleasing to you asked the prince in surprise you are very handsome very charming prince said zelia but you are not like the good king your father i fear you would make me very miserable if i were your queen in a great rage prince cherry ordered the young girl to be put in prison and the key of her dungeon he kept he told one of his friends a wicked man who flattered him for his own purposes about the thing and asked his advice are you not king said the bad friend may you not do as you will keep the girl in a dungeon till she does as you command and if she will not sell her as a slave but would it not be a disgrace for me to harm an innocent creature said the prince it would be a disgrace to you to have it said that one of your subjects dared disobey you said the courtier he had cleverly touched the prince's worst trait his pride prince cherry went at once to zelia's dungeon prepared to do this cruel thing zelia was gone no one had the key save the prince himself yet she was gone the only person who could have dared to help her thought the prince was his old tutor suliman the only man left who ever rebuked him for anything in fury he ordered suliman to be put in fetters and brought before him as his servants left him to carry out the wicked order there was a clash as of thunder in the room and then a blinding light fairy candide stood before him her beautiful face was stern and her silver voice rang like a trumpet as she said wicked and selfish prince you have become baser than the beasts you hunt you are furious as a lion revengeful as a serpent greedy as a wolf and brutal as a bull take therefore the shape of those beasts whom you resemble with horror the prince felt himself being transformed into a monster he tried to rush upon the fairy and kill her but she had vanished with her words as he stood her voice came from the air saying sadly learn to conquer your pride by being in submission to your own subjects at the same moment prince cherry felt himself being transported to a distant forest where he was set down by a clear stream in the water he saw his own terrible image he had the head of a lion with bull's horns the feet of a wolf and a tail like a serpent and as he gazed in horror the fairy's voice whispered your soul has become more ugly than your shape is you yourself have deformed it the poor beast rushed away from the sound of her words but in a moment he stumbled into a trap set by bear-catchers when the trappers found him they were delighted to have caught a curiosity and they immediately dragged him to the palace courtyard there he heard the whole court buzzing with gossip prince cherry had been struck by lightning and killed was the news and the five favourite courtiers had struggled to make themselves rulers but the people had refused them and offered the crown to suliman the good old tutor even as he heard this the prince saw suliman on the steps of the palace speaking to the people i will take the crown to keep in trust he said perhaps the prince is not dead he was a bad king we do not want him back said the people i know his heart said suliman it is not all bad it is tainted but not corrupt perhaps he will repent and come back to us a good king when the beast heard this it touched him so much that he stopped tearing at his chains and became gentle he let his keepers lead him away to the royal menagerie without hurting them life was very terrible to the prince now but he began to see that he had brought all his sorrow on himself and he tried to bear it patiently the worst to bear was the cruelty of the keeper at last one night this keeper was in great danger a tiger got loose and attacked him good enough let him die thought prince cherry but when he saw how helpless the keeper was he repented and sprang to help he killed the tiger and saved the keeper's life as he crouched at the keeper's feet a voice said good actions never go unrewarded and the terrible monster was changed into a pretty little white dog the keeper carried the beautiful little dog to the court and told the story and from then on cherry was carefully treated and had the best of everything but in order to keep the little dog from growing the queen ordered that he should be fed very little and that was pretty hard for the poor prince he was often half starved although so much petted one day he had carried his crust of bread to a retired spot in the palace woods where he loved to be when he saw a poor old woman hunting for roots and seeming almost starved poor thing he thought she is even more hungry than i and he ran up and dropped the crust at her feet the woman ate it and seemed greatly refreshed cherry was glad of that and he was running happily back to his kennel when he heard cries of distress and suddenly he saw some rough men dragging along a young girl who was weeping and crying for help what was his horror to see that the young girl was zelia oh how he wished he were the monster once more so that he could kill the men and rescue her but he could do nothing except bark and bite at the heels of the wicked men that did not stop them they drove him off with blows and carried zelia into a palace in the wood poor cherry crouched by the steps and watched his heart was full of pity and rage but suddenly he thought i was as bad as these men i myself put zelia in prison and would have treated her worse still if i had not been prevented the thought made him so sorry and ashamed that he repented bitterly the evil he had done presently a window opened and cherry saw zelia lean out and throw down a piece of meat he seized it and was just going to devour it when the old woman to whom he had given his crust snatched it away and took him in her arms no you shall not eat it you poor little thing she said for every bit of food in that house is poisoned at the same moment a voice said good actions never go unrewarded and instantly prince cherry was transformed into a little white dove with great joy he flew to the open palace window to seek out his zelia to try to help her but though he hunted in every room no zelia was to be found he had to fly away without seeing her he wanted more than anything else to find her and stay near her so he flew out into the world to seek her he sought her in many lands until one day in a far eastern country he found her sitting in a tent by the side of an old white-haired hermit cherry was wild with delight he flew to her shoulder caressed her hair with his beak and cooed in her ear you dear lovely little thing said zelia will you stay with me if you will i will love you always ah zelia see what you have done laughed the hermit at that instant the white dove vanished and prince cherry stood there as handsome and charming as ever and with a look of kindness and modesty in his eyes which had never been there before at the same time the hermit stood up his flowing hair changed to shining gold and his face became a lovely woman's face it was the fairy candide zelia has broken your spell she said to the prince as i meant she should when you were worthy of her love zelia and prince cherry fell at the fairy's feet but with a beautiful smile she bade them come to their kingdom in a trice they were transported to the prince's palace where king suliman greeted them with tears of joy he gave back the throne with all his heart and king cherry ruled again with zelia for his queen he wore the little gold ring all the rest of his life but never once did it have to prick him hard enough to make his finger bleed the gold in the orchard there was once a farmer who had a fine olive orchard he was very industrious and the farm always prospered under his care but he knew that his three sons despised the farm work and were eager to make wealth fast through adventure when the farmer was old and felt that his time had come to die he called the three sons to him and said my sons there is a pot of gold hidden in the olive orchard dig for it if you wish it the sons tried to get him to tell them in what part of the orchard the gold was hidden but he would tell them nothing more after the farmer was dead the sons went to work to find the pot of gold since they did not know where the hiding-place was they agreed to begin in a line at one end of the orchard and to dig until one of them should find the money they dug until they had turned up the soil from one end of the orchard to the other round the tree-roots and between them but no pot of gold was to be found it seemed as if some one must have stolen it or as if the farmer had been wandering in his wits the three sons were bitterly disappointed to have all their work for nothing the next olive season the olive trees in the orchard bore more fruit than they had ever given before the fine cultivating they had had from the digging brought so much fruit and of so fine a quality that when it was sold it gave the sons a whole pot of gold and when they saw how much money had come from the orchard they suddenly understood what the wise father had meant when he said there is gold hidden in the orchard dig for it margaret of new orleans if you ever go to the beautiful city of new orleans somebody will be sure to take you down into the old business part of the city where there are banks and shops and hotels and show you a statue which stands in a little square there it is the statue of a woman sitting in a low chair with her arms around a child who leans against her the woman is not at all pretty she wears thick common shoes a plain dress with a little shawl and a sun-bonnet she is stout and short and her face is a square-chinned irish face but her eyes look at you like your mother's now there is something very surprising about this statue it was the first one that was ever made in america in honour of a woman even in europe there are not many monuments to women and most of the few are to great queens or princesses very beautiful and very richly dressed you see this statue in new orleans is not quite like anything else it is the statue of a woman named margaret her whole name was margaret haughery but no one in new orleans remembers her by it any more than you think of your dearest sister by her full name she is just margaret this is her story and it tells why people made a monument for her when margaret was a tiny baby her father and mother died and she was adopted by two young people as poor and as kind as her own parents she lived with them until she grew up then she married and had a little baby of her own but very soon her husband died and then the baby died too and margaret was all alone in the world she was poor but she was strong and knew how to work all day from morning until evening she ironed clothes in a laundry and every day as she worked by the window she saw the little motherless children from the orphan asylum near by working and playing about after a while there came a great sickness upon the city and so many mothers and fathers died that there were more orphans than the asylum could possibly take care of they needed a good friend now you would hardly think would you that a poor woman who worked in a laundry could be much of a friend to them but margaret was she went straight to the kind sisters who had the asylum and told them she was going to give them part of her wages and was going to work for them besides pretty soon she had worked so hard that she had some money saved from her wages with this she bought two cows and a little delivery cart then she carried her milk to her customers in the little cart every morning and as she went she begged the pieces of food left over from the hotels and rich houses and brought it back in the cart to the hungry children in the asylum in the very hardest times that was often all the food the poor children had a part of the money margaret earned went every week to the asylum and after a few years that was made very much larger and better margaret was so careful and so good at business that in spite of her giving she bought more cows and earned more money with this she built a home for orphan babies she called it her baby house after a time margaret had a chance to get a bakery and then she became a bread-woman instead of a milk-woman she carried the bread just as she had carried the milk in her cart and still she kept giving money to the asylum then the great war came the civil war in all the trouble and sickness and fear of that time margaret drove her cart of bread and somehow she had always enough to give the starving soldiers and for her babies beside what she sold and despite all this she earned enough so that when the war was over she built a big steam factory for her bread by this time everybody in the city knew her the children all over the city loved her the business men were proud of her the poor people all came to her for advice she used to sit at the open door of her office in a calico gown and a little shawl and give a good word to everybody rich or poor then by and by one day margaret died and when it was time to read her will the people found that with all her giving she had still saved a great deal of money and that she had left every penny of it to the different orphan asylums of the city -- each one of them was given something whether they were for white children or black for jews catholics or protestants made no difference for margaret always said they are all orphans alike and just think dears that splendid wise will was signed with a cross instead of a name for margaret had never learned to read or write when the people of new orleans knew that margaret was dead they said she was a mother to the motherless she was a friend to those who had no friends she had wisdom greater than schools can teach we will not let her memory go from us so they made a statue of her just as she used to look sitting in her own office door or driving in her own little cart and there it stands to-day in memory of the great love and the great power of plain margaret haughery of new orleans the dagda's harp you know dears in the old countries there are many fine stories about things which happened so very long ago that nobody knows exactly how much of them is true ireland is like that it is so old that even as long ago as four thousand years it had people who dug in the mines and knew how to weave cloth and to make beautiful ornaments out of gold and who could fight and make laws but we do not know just where they came from nor exactly how they lived these people left us some splendid stories about their kings their fights and their beautiful women but it all happened such a long time ago that the stories are mixtures of things that really happened and what people said about them and we don't know just which is which the stories are called legends one of the prettiest legends is the story i am going to tell you about the dagda's harp it is said that there were two quite different kinds of people in ireland one set of people with long dark hair and dark eyes called fomorians -- they carried long slender spears made of golden bronze when they fought -- and another race of people who were golden-haired and blue-eyed and who carried short blunt heavy spears of dull metal the golden-haired people had a great chieftain who was also a kind of high priest who was called the dagda and this dagda had a wonderful magic harp the harp was beautiful to look upon mighty in size made of rare wood and ornamented with gold and jewels and it had wonderful music in its strings which only the dagda could call out when the men were going out to battle the dagda would set up his magic harp and sweep his hand across the strings and a war song would ring out which would make every warrior buckle on his armour brace his knees and shout forth to the fight then when the men came back from the battle weary and wounded the dagda would take his harp and strike a few chords and as the magic music stole out upon the air every man forgot his weariness and the smart of his wounds and thought of the honour he had won and of the comrade who had died beside him and of the safety of his wife and children then the song would swell out louder and every warrior would remember only the glory he had helped win for the king and each man would rise at the great table his cup in his hand and shout long live the king there came a time when the fomorians and the golden-haired men were at war and in the midst of a great battle while the dagda's hall was not so well guarded as usual some of the chieftains of the fomorians stole the great harp from the wall where it hung and fled away with it their wives and children and some few of their soldiers went with them and they fled fast and far through the night until they were a long way from the battlefield then they thought they were safe and they turned aside into a vacant castle by the road and sat down to a banquet hanging the stolen harp on the wall the dagda with two or three of his warriors had followed hard on their track and while they were in the midst of their banqueting the door was suddenly burst open and the dagda stood there with his men some of the fomorians sprang to their feet but before any of them could grasp a weapon the dagda called out to his harp on the wall come to me o my harp the great harp recognised its master's voice and leaped from the wall whirling through the hall sweeping aside and killing the men who got in its way it sprang to its master's hand and the dagda took his harp and swept his hand across the strings in three great solemn chords the harp answered with the magic music of tears as the wailing harmony smote upon the air the women of the fomorians bowed their heads and wept bitterly the strong men turned their faces aside and the little children sobbed again the dagda touched the strings and this time the magic music of mirth leaped from the harp and when they heard that music of mirth the young warriors of the fomorians began to laugh they laughed till the cups fell from their grasp and the spears dropped from their hands while the wine flowed from the broken bowls they laughed until their limbs were helpless with excess of glee once more the dagda touched his harp but very very softly and now a music stole forth as soft as dreams and as sweet as joy it was the magic music of sleep when they heard that gently gently the fomorian women bowed their heads in slumber the little children crept to their mothers' laps the old men nodded and the young warriors drooped in their seats and closed their eyes one after another all the fomorians sank into sleep when they were all deep in slumber the dagda took his magic harp and he and his golden-haired warriors stole softly away and came in safety to their own homes again the tailor and the three beasts there was once a tailor in galway and he started out on a journey to go to the king's court at dublin he had not gone far when he met a white horse and he saluted him god save you said the tailor god save you said the horse where are you going i am going to dublin said the tailor to build a court for the king and to get a lady for a wife if i am able to do it for it seems the king had promised his daughter and a great lot of money to anyone who should be able to build up his court the trouble was that three giants lived in the wood near the court and every night they came out of the wood and threw down all that was built by day so nobody could get the court built would you make me a hole said the old white garraun where i could go in to hide whenever the people come to fetch me to the mill or the kiln so that they won't see me for they tire me out doing work for them i'll do that indeed said the tailor and welcome he brought his spade and shovel and he made a hole and he asked the old white horse to go down into it so that he could see if it would fit him the white horse went down into the hole but when he tried to come up again he was not able make a place for me now said the white horse by which i can come up out of the hole here whenever i am hungry i will not said the tailor remain where you are until i come back and i'll lift you up the tailor went forward next day and the fox met him god save you said the fox god save you said the tailor where are you going said the fox i'm going to dublin to try to make a court for the king would you make a place for me where i can hide said the fox the rest of the foxes are always beating me and they will not allow me to eat anything with them i'll do that for you said the tailor he took his axe and his saw and he made a thing like a crate and he told the fox to get into it so that he could see whether it would fit him the fox went into it and when the tailor had him down he shut him in when the fox was satisfied at last that he had a nice place of it within he asked the tailor to let him out and the tailor answered that he would not wait there until i come back again said he the tailor went forward the next day and he had not walked very far when he met a lion and the lion greeted him god save you said the lion god save you said the tailor where are you going said the lion i'm going to dublin to make a court for the king if i am able to make it said the tailor if you were to make a plough for me said the lion i and the other lions could be ploughing and harrowing until we'd have a bit to eat in the harvest i'll do that for you said the tailor he brought his axe and his saw and he made a plough when the plough was made he put a hole in the beam of it and got the lion to go in under the plough so that he might see if he was any good as a ploughman he placed the lion's tail in the hole he had made for it and then clapped in a peg and the lion was not able to draw out his tail again loose me now said the lion and we'll fix ourselves and go ploughing the tailor said he would not loose him until he came back himself he left him there then and he came to dublin when he arrived he engaged workmen and began to build the court at the end of the day he had the workmen put a great stone on top of the work when the great stone was raised up the tailor put some sort of contrivance under it that he might be able to throw it down as soon as the giants came near to it the workpeople then went home and the tailor went in hiding behind the big stone when the darkness of the night was come he saw the three giants arriving and they began throwing down the court until they arrived at the place where the tailor was in hiding up above and one of them struck a blow with his sledge on the place where he was the tailor threw down the stone and it fell on him and killed him the other two went home then and left all of the court that was remaining without throwing it down since their companion was dead the workmen came again the next day and they were working until night and as they were going home the tailor told them to put up the big stone on the top of the work as it had been the night before they did that for him went home and the tailor went in hiding the same as he did the evening before when the people had all gone to rest the two giants came and they were throwing down all that was before them but as soon as they began the tailor commenced manoeuvring until he was able to throw down the great stone so that it fell upon the skull of the giant that was under him and it killed him after this there was only the one giant left and he never came again until the court was finished then when the work was over the tailor went to the king and told him to give him his wife and his money as he had the court finished and the king said he would not give him any wife until he had killed the other giant for he said that it was not by his strength he had killed the two giants before and that he would give him nothing now until he killed the other one for him then the tailor said that he would kill the other giant for him and welcome that there should be no delay at all about that the tailor went then till he came to the place where the other giant was and asked did he want a servant-boy the giant said he did want one if he could get one who would do everything that he would do himself anything that you will do i will do said the tailor they went to their dinner then and when they had eaten it the giant asked the tailor would he dare to swallow as much boiling broth as himself the tailor said i will certainly do that but you must give me an hour before we commence the tailor went out then and he got a sheepskin which he sewed up until he made a bag of it and he slipped it down under his coat he came in then and told the giant first to drink a gallon of the broth himself the giant drank that up while it was boiling i'll do that said the tailor he went on until it was all poured into the skin and the giant thought he had drunk it the giant drank another gallon then and the tailor let another gallon down into the skin but the giant thought he was drinking it i'll do a thing now that you will not dare to do said the tailor you will not said the giant what is it you would do make a hole and let out the broth again said the tailor do it yourself first said the giant the tailor gave a prod of the knife and he let the broth out of the skin now you do that said he i will said the giant giving such a prod of the knife into his own stomach that he killed himself that is the way the tailor killed the third giant he went to the king then and desired him to send him out his wife and his money saying that he would throw down the court again if he did not do so immediately they were afraid then that he would throw down the court and they sent the wife to him when the tailor was a day gone himself and his wife they repented and followed him to take his wife away from him again the people who went after him followed him until they came to the place where the lion was and the lion said to them the tailor and his wife were here yesterday i saw them going by and if you will loose me now i am swifter than you and i will follow them until i overtake them when they heard that they released the lion the lion and the people of dublin went on and pursued the tailor until they came to the place where the fox was and the fox greeted them and said the tailor and his wife were here this morning and if you will loose me i am swifter than you and i will follow them and overtake them they therefore set the fox free the lion and the fox and the army of dublin went on then trying to catch the tailor and they kept going until they came to the place where the old white garraun was and the old white garraun told them that the tailor and his wife were there in the morning and loose me said he i am swifter than you and i'll overtake them they released the old white garraun then and the old white garraun the fox the lion and the army of dublin pursued the tailor and his wife and it was not long before they came up with them when the tailor saw them coming he got out of the coach with his wife and he sat down on the ground when the old white garraun saw the tailor sitting on the ground he said that's the position he was in when he made the hole for me that i couldn't get out of when i went down into it i'll go no nearer to him no said the fox but that's the way he was when he was making the thing for me and i'll go no nearer to him no says the lion but that's the very way he had when he was making the plough that i was caught in i'll go no nearer to him they all left him then and returned the tailor and his wife came home to galway how the sea became salt this story was told long ago by our northern forefathers who brought it with them in their dragon ships when they crossed the north sea to settle in england in those days men were apt to invent stories to account for things about them which seemed peculiar and loving the sea as they did it is not strange that they had remarked the peculiarity of the ocean water and had found a reason why it is so different from the water in the rivers and steams this is not the only story that has come down to tell us how people of old accounted for the sea being salt there are many such stories each different from the other all showing that the same childlike spirit of inquiry was at work in different places striving to find an answer to this riddle of nature there sprang from the sons of odin a race of men who became mighty kings of the earth and one of these named frode ruled over the lands that are called denmark now about this time were found in denmark two great millstones so large that no one had the strength to turn them so frode sent for all the wise men of the land and bade them examine the stones and tell him of what use they were since no one could grind with them and after the wise men had looked closely at them and read the magic letters which were cut upon their edge they said that the millstones were precious indeed since they would grind out of nothing anything that the miller might wish so king frode sent messengers over the world to find for him two servants who would be strong enough to grind with the millstones and after a long long time his messengers found him two maid-servants who were bigger and stronger than anyone in denmark had ever seen but no one guessed that these were really giant-maidens who bore a grudge against all of the race of odin directly the giant-maidens were brought before frode and before they had rested after their long journey or satisfied their hunger he bade them go to the mill and grind for him gold and peace and happiness they sang and swung the swift mill stone and with loud voice they made their moan 'we grind for frode wealth and gold abundant riches he shall behold ' presently frode came into the mill to see that the new servants were performing their task diligently and as he watched them from the shadow by the door the maidens stayed their grinding for a while to rest the greedy man could not bear to see even an instant's pause and he came out of the shadow and bade them with harsh words go on grinding and cease not except for so long as the cuckoo was silent or while he himself sang a song now it was early summer-time and the cuckoo was calling all the day and most of the night so the giant-maidens waxed very wroth with king frode and as they resumed their labours they sang a song of the hardness of their lot in the household of this pitiless king they had been grinding out wealth and happiness and peace but now they bade the magic stones to grind something very different presently as the great stones moved round and round frode who still stood by heard one chant in a low sing-song voice -- i see a fire east of the town -- the curlews awake and sound a note of warning a host approaches in haste to burn the dwelling of the king and the next took up her song -- no longer will frode sit on his throne and rule over rings of red gold and mighty millstones now must we grind with all our might -- and behold red warriors come forth -- and revenge and bloodshed and ruin then frode shook from head to foot in his terror for he heard the tramp of a mighty host of warriors advancing from the sea and as he looked for a way of escape the braces of the millstones broke with the strong grinding and fell in two and the whole world shook and trembled with the mighty shock of that breaking but through the crash and din came the voices of the giant-maidens loudly chanting -- we have turned the stone round though weary the maidens see what they have ground and that same night a mighty sea-king came up and slew frode and plundered his city when he had sacked the city the sea-king took on board his ship the two giant-maidens and with them the broken millstones and he bade them begin at once to grind salt for of this he had very scanty store so they ground and ground and in the middle of the night being weary they asked the sea-king if he had not got salt enough but the sea-king was hard of heart like frode and he roughly bade them go on grinding and the maidens did so and worked to such effect that within a short time the millstones had ground out so much salt that the weight of it began to sink the ship down down it sank ship and giants and millstones and in that spot in the very middle of the ocean arose a whirlpool from whence the salt is carried north and south east and west throughout the waters of the earth and that is how the sea became salt the castle of fortune one lovely summer morning just as the sun rose two travellers started on a journey they were both strong young men but one was a lazy fellow and the other was a worker as the first sunbeams came over the hills they shone on a great castle standing on the heights as far away as the eye could see it was a wonderful and beautiful castle all glistening towers that gleamed like marble and glancing windows that shone like crystal the two young men looked at it eagerly and longed to go nearer suddenly out of the distance something like a great butterfly of white and gold swept toward them and when it came nearer they saw that it was a most beautiful lady robed in floating garments as fine as cobwebs and wearing on her head a crown so bright that no one could tell whether it was of diamonds or of dew she stood light as air on a great shining golden ball which rolled along with her swifter than the wind as she passed the travellers she turned her face to them and smiled follow me she said the lazy man sat down in the grass with a discontented sigh she has an easy time of it he said but the industrious man ran after the lovely lady and caught the hem of her floating robe in his grasp who are you and whither are you going he asked i am the fairy of fortune the beautiful lady said and that is my castle you may reach it to-day if you will there is time if you waste none if you reach it before the last stroke of midnight i will receive you there and will be your friend but if you come one second after midnight it will be too late when she had said this her robe slipped from the traveller's hand and she was gone the industrious man hurried back to his friend and told him what the fairy had said the idea said the lazy man and he laughed of course if we had a horse there would be some chance but walk all that way no thank you then good-bye said his friend i am off and he set out down the road toward the shining castle with a good steady stride his eyes straight ahead the lazy man lay down in the soft grass and looked rather wistfully at the far-away towers if only i had a good horse he sighed just at that moment he felt something warm nosing about at his shoulder and heard a little whinny he turned round and there stood a little horse it was a dainty creature gentle-looking and finely built and it was saddled and bridled hello said the lazy man luck often comes when one isn't looking for it and in an instant he had leaped on the horse and headed him for the castle of fortune the little horse started at a fine pace and in a very few minutes they overtook the other traveller plodding along on foot how do you like shank's pony laughed the lazy man as he passed his friend the industrious man only nodded and kept on with his steady stride eyes straight ahead the horse kept his good pace and by noon the towers of the castle stood out against the sky much nearer and more beautiful exactly at noon the horse turned aside from the road into a shady grove on a hill and stopped wise beast said his rider 'haste makes waste ' and all things are better in moderation i'll follow your example and eat and rest a bit he dismounted and sat down in the cool moss with his back against a tree he had a lunch in his traveller's pouch and he ate it comfortably then he felt drowsy from the heat and the early ride so he pulled his hat over his eyes and settled himself for a nap it will go all the better for a little rest he said that was a sleep he slept like the seven sleepers and he dreamed the most beautiful things you could imagine at last he dreamed that he had entered the castle of fortune and was being received with great festivities everything he wanted was brought to him and music played while fireworks were set off in his honour the music was so loud that he awoke he sat up rubbing his eyes and behold the fireworks were the very last rays of the setting sun and the music was the voice of the other traveller passing the grove on foot time to be off said the lazy man and looked about him for the pretty horse no horse was to be found the only living thing near was an old bony grey donkey the man called and whistled and looked but no little horse appeared after a long while he gave it up and since there was nothing better to do he mounted the old grey donkey and set out again the donkey was slow and he was hard to ride but he was better than nothing and gradually the lazy man saw the towers of the castle draw nearer now it began to grow dark in the castle windows the lights began to show then came trouble slower and slower went the grey donkey slower and slower till in the very middle of a pitch-black wood he stopped and stood still not a step would he budge for all the coaxing and scolding and beating his rider could give at last the rider kicked him as well as beat him and at that the donkey felt that he had had enough up went his hind heels and down went his head and over it went the lazy man on to the stony ground there he lay groaning for many minutes for it was not a soft place i can assure you how he wished he were in a soft warm bed with his aching bones comfortable in blankets the very thought of it made him remember the castle of fortune for he knew there must be fine beds there to get to those beds he was even willing to bestir his poor limbs so he sat up and felt about him for the donkey no donkey was to be found the lazy man crept round and round the spot where he had fallen scratched his hands on the stumps tore his face in the briers and bumped his knees on the stones but no donkey was there he would have laid down to sleep again but he could hear now the howls of hungry wolves in the woods that it did not sound pleasant finally his hand struck against something that felt like a saddle he grasped it thankfully and started to mount his donkey the beast he took hold of seemed very small and as he mounted he felt that its sides were moist and slimy it gave him a shudder and he hesitated but at that moment he heard a distant clock strike it was striking eleven there was still time to reach the castle of fortune but no more than enough so he mounted his new steed and rode on once more the animal was easier to sit on than the donkey and the saddle seemed remarkably high behind it was good to lean against but even the donkey was not so slow as this the new steed was slower than he after a while however he pushed his way out of the woods into the open and there stood the castle only a little way ahead all its windows were ablaze with lights a ray from them fell on the lazy man's beast and he saw what he was riding it was a gigantic snail a snail as large as a calf a cold shudder ran over the lazy man's body and he would have got off his horrid animal then and there but just then the clock struck once more it was the first of the long slow strokes that mark midnight the man grew frantic when he heard it he drove his heels into the snail's sides to make him hurry instantly the snail drew in his head curled up in his shell and left the lazy man sitting in a heap on the ground the clock struck twice if the man had run for it he could still have reached the castle but instead he sat still and shouted for a horse a beast a beast he wailed any kind of a beast that will take me to the castle the clock struck three times and as it struck the third note something came rustling and rattling out of the darkness something that sounded like a horse with harness the lazy man jumped on its back a very queer low back as he mounted he saw the doors of the castle open and saw his friend standing on the threshold waving his cap and beckoning to him the clock struck four times and the new steed began to stir as it struck five he moved a pace forward as it struck six he stopped as it struck seven he turned himself about as it struck eight he began to move backward away from the castle the lazy man shouted and beat him but the beast went slowly backward and the clock struck nine the man tried to slide off then but from all sides of his strange animal great arms came reaching up and held him fast and in the next ray of moonlight that broke the dark clouds he saw that he was mounted on a monster crab one by one the lights went out in the castle windows the clock struck ten backward went the crab eleven still the crab went backward the clock struck twelve then the great doors shut with a clang and the castle of fortune was closed for ever to the lazy man what became of him and his crab no one knows to this day and no one cares but the industrious man was received by the fairy of fortune and made happy in the castle as long as he wanted to stay and ever afterward she was his friend helping him not only to happiness for himself but also showing him how to help others wherever he went david and goliath a long time ago there was a boy named david who lived in a country in the far east he was good to look upon for he had fair hair and a ruddy skin and he was very strong and brave and modest he was shepherd-boy for his father and all day -- often all night -- he was out in the fields far from home watching over the sheep he had to guard them from wild animals and lead them to the right pastures and care for them by and by war broke out between the people of david's country and a people that lived near at hand these men were called philistines and the people of david's country were named israelites all the strong men of israel went up to the battle to fight for their king david's three older brothers went but he was only a boy so he was left behind to care for the sheep after the brothers had been gone some time david's father longed very much to hear from them and to know if they were safe so he sent for david from the fields and said to him take now for thy brothers an ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves and run to the camp where thy brothers are and carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand and see how thy brothers fare and bring me word again an ephah is about three pecks david rose early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took the corn and the loaves and the cheeses as his father had commanded him and went to the camp of the israelites the camp stood on a mountain on the one side and the philistines stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between david came to the place where the israelites were just as the host was going forth to the fight shouting for the battle so he left his gifts in the hands of the keeper of the baggage and ran into the army amongst the soldiers to find his brothers when he found them he saluted them and began to talk with them but while he was asking them the questions his father had commanded there arose a great shouting and tumult among the israelites and men came running back from the front line of battle everything became confusion david looked to see what the trouble was and he saw a strange sight down the slope of the opposite mountain came striding a philistine warrior calling out something in a taunting voice he was a gigantic man the largest david had ever seen and he was covered with armour that shone in the sun he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders his spear was so tremendous that the staff of it was like a weaver's beam and his shield so great that a man went before him to carry it who is that asked david it is goliath of gath champion of the philistines said the soldiers about every day for forty days he has come forth so and challenged us to send a man against him in single combat and since no one dares to go out against him alone the armies cannot fight that was one of the laws of warfare in those times what said david does none dare go out against him as he spoke the giant stood still on the hillside opposite the host of israel and shouted his challenge scornfully he said why are ye come out to set your battle in array am i not a philistine and ye servants of saul choose you a man and let him come down to me if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve us i defy the armies of israel this day give me a man that we may fight together when king saul heard these words he was dismayed and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and were sore afraid david heard them talking among themselves whispering and murmuring they were saying have ye seen this man that is come up surely if anyone killeth him that man will the king make rich perhaps he will give him his daughter in marriage and make his family free in israel david heard this and he asked the men if it were so it was surely so they said but said david who is this philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god and he was stirred with anger very soon some of the officers told the king about the youth who was asking so many questions and who said that it was shame upon israel that a mere philistine should defy the armies of the living god immediately saul sent for him when david came before saul he said to the king let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine but saul looked at david and said thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he has been a man of war from his youth then david said to saul once i was keeping my father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and i went out after the lion and struck him and delivered the lamb out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by the beard and struck him and slew him thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this philistine shall be as one of them for he hath defied the armies of the living god the lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine go said saul and the lord be with thee and he armed david with his own armour -- he put a helmet of brass upon his head and armed him with a coat of mail but when david girded his sword upon his armour and tried to walk he said to saul i cannot go with these for i am not used to them and he put them off then he took his staff in his hand and went and chose five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had and his sling was in his hand and he went out and drew near to the philistine and the philistine came on and drew near to david and the man that bore his shield went before him and when the philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him for david was but a boy and ruddy and of a fair countenance and he said to david am i a dog that thou comest to me with a cudgel and with curses he cried out again come to me and i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field but david looked at him and answered thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou hast defied this day will the lord deliver thee into my hand and i will smite thee and take thy head from thee and i will give the carcasses of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you into our hands and then when the philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet david david made haste and ran toward the army to meet the philistine and when he was a little way from him he put his hand in his bag and took from thence a stone and put it in his sling and slung it and smote the philistine in the forehead so that the stone sank into his forehead and he fell on his face to the earth and david ran and stood upon the philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and slew him with it then when the philistines saw that their champion was dead they fled but the army of israel pursued them and victory was with the men of israel and after the battle david was taken to the king's tent and made a captain over many men and he went no more to his father's house to herd the sheep but became a man in the king's service the shepherd's song david had many fierce battles to fight for king saul against the enemies of israel and he won them all then later he had to fight against the king's own soldiers to save himself for king saul grew wickedly jealous of david's fame as a soldier and tried to kill him twice when david had a chance to kill the king he forbore to harm him but even then saul continued trying to take his life and david was kept away from his home as if he were an enemy but when king saul died the people chose david for their king because there was no one so brave so wise or so faithful to god king david lived a long time and made his people famous for victory and happiness he had many troubles and many wars but he always trusted that god would help him and he never deserted his own people in any hard place after a battle or when it was a holiday or when he was very thankful for something king david used to make songs and sing them before the people some of these songs were so beautiful that they have never been forgotten after all these hundreds and hundred of years we sing them still we call them psalms often after david had made a song his chief musician would sing with him as the people gathered to worship god sometimes the singers were divided into two great choruses and went to the service in two processions then one chorus would sing a verse of david's song and the other procession would answer with the next and then both would sing together it was very beautiful to hear even now we sometimes do that with the songs of david in our churches one of his psalms that everybody loves is a song that david made when he remembered the days before he came to saul's camp he remembered the days and nights he used to spend in the fields with the sheep when he was just a shepherd-boy and he thought to himself that god had taken care of him just as carefully as he himself used to care for the little lambs it is a beautiful song i wish we knew the music that david made for it but we only know his words i will tell it to you now and then you may learn it to say for yourselves the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord for ever the hidden servants this is a legend about a hermit who lived long ago he lived high up on the mountainside in a tiny cave his food was roots and acorns a bit of bread given by a peasant or a cheese brought by a woman who wanted his prayers his work was praying and thinking about god for forty years he lived so preaching to the people praying for them comforting them in trouble and most of all worshipping in his heart there was just one thing he cared about it was to make his soul so pure and perfect that it could be one of the stones in god's great temple of heaven one day after the forty years he had a great longing to know how far along he had got with his work -- how it looked to the heavenly father and he prayed that he might be shown a man -- whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown to the selfsame measure as his own whose treasure on the celestial shore could neither be less than his nor more as he looked up from his prayer a white-robed angel stood in the path before him the hermit bowed before the messenger with great gladness for he knew that his wish was answered go to the nearest town the angel said and there in the public square you will find a mountebank a clown making the people laugh for money he is the man you seek his soul has grown to the selfsame stature as your own his treasure on the celestial shore is neither less than yours nor more when the angel had faded from sight the hermit bowed his head again but this time with great sorrow and fear had his forty years of prayer been a terrible mistake and was his soul indeed like a clown fooling in the market-place he knew not what to think almost he hoped he should not find the man and could believe that he had dreamed the angel vision but when he came after a long tiring walk to the village and the square alas there was the clown doing his silly tricks for the crowd the hermit stood and looked at him with terror and sadness for he felt that he was looking at his own soul the face he saw was thin and tired and though it kept a smile or a grin for the people it seemed very sad to the hermit soon the man felt the hermit's eyes he could not go on with his tricks and when he had stopped and the crowd had left the hermit went and drew the man aside to a place where they could rest for he wanted more than anything else on earth to know what the man's soul was like because what it was his was so after a little he asked the clown very gently what his life was what it had been and the clown answered very sadly that it was just as it looked -- a life of foolish tricks for that was the only way of earning his bread that he knew but have you never been anything different asked the hermit painfully the clown's head sank in his hands yes holy father he said i have been something else i was a thief i once belonged to the most wicked band of mountain robbers that ever tormented the land and i was as wicked as the worst alas the hermit felt that his heart was breaking was this how he looked to the heavenly father -- like a thief a cruel mountain robber he could hardly speak and the tears streamed from his old eyes but he gathered strength to ask one more question i beg you he said if you have ever done a single good deed in your life remember it now and tell it to me for he thought that even one good deed would save him from utter despair yes one the clown said but it was so small it is not worth telling my life has been worthless tell me that one pleaded the hermit once said the man our band broke into a convent garden and stole away one of the nuns to sell as a slave or to keep for a ransom we dragged her with us over the rough long way to our mountain camp and set a guard over her for the night the poor thing prayed to us so piteously to let her go and as she begged she looked from one hard face to another with trusting imploring eyes as if she could not believe men could be really bad father when her eyes met mine something pierced my heart pity and shame leaped up for the first time within me but i made my face as hard and cruel as the rest and she turned away hopeless when all was dark and still i stole like a cat to where she lay bound i put my hand on her wrist and whispered 'trust me and i will take you safely home ' i cut her bonds with my knife and she looked at me to show that she trusted father by terrible ways that i knew hidden from the others i took her safe to the convent gate she knocked they opened and she slipped inside and as she left me she turned and said 'god will remember ' that was all i could not go back to the old bad life and i had never learned an honest way to earn my bread so i became a clown and must be a clown until i die no no my son cried the hermit and now his tears were tears of joy god has remembered your soul is in his sight even as mine who have prayed and preached for forty years your treasure waits for you on the heavenly shore just as mine does as yours father you mock me said the clown but when the hermit told him the story of his prayer and the angel's answer the poor clown was transfigured with joy for he knew that his sins were forgiven and when the hermit went home to his mountain the clown went with him he too became a hermit and spent his time in praise and prayer together they lived and worked and helped the poor and when after two years the man who had been a clown died the hermit felt that he had lost a brother more holy than himself for ten years more the hermit lived in his mountain hut thinking always of god fasting and praying and doing no least thing that was wrong then one day the wish once more came to know how his work was growing and once more he prayed that he might see a being -- whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown to the selfsame measure as his own whose treasure on the celestial shore could neither be less than his nor more once more his prayer was answered the angel came to him and told him to go to a certain village on the other side of the mountain and to a small farm in it where two women lived in them he should find two souls like his own in god's sight when the hermit came to the door of the little farm the two women who lived there were overjoyed to see him for everyone loved and honoured his name they put a chair for him on the cool porch and brought food and drink but the hermit was too eager to wait he longed greatly to know what the souls of the two women were like and from their looks he could see only that they were gentle and honest one was old and the other of middle age presently he asked them about their lives they told him the little there was to tell they had worked hard always in the fields with their husbands or in the house they had many children they had seen hard times -- sickness sorrow but they had never despaired but what of your good deeds the hermit asked -- what have you done for god very little they said sadly for they were too poor to give much to be sure twice every year when they killed a sheep for food they gave half to their poorer neighbours that is very good very faithful the hermit said and is there any other good deed you have done nothing said the older woman unless unless -- it might be called a good deed -- -- she looked at the younger woman who smiled back at her what said the hermit still the woman hesitated but at last she said timidly it is not much to tell father only this that it is twenty years since my sister-in-law and i came to live together in the house we have brought up our families here and in all the twenty years there has never been a cross word between us or a look that was less than kind the hermit bent his head before the two women and gave thanks in his heart if my soul is as these he said i am blessed indeed and suddenly a great light came into the hermit's mind and he saw how many ways there are of serving god some serve him in churches and in hermits' cells by praise and prayer some poor souls who have been very wicked turn from their wickedness with sorrow and serve him with repentance some live faithfully and gently in humble homes working bringing up children keeping kind and cheerful some bear pain patiently for his sake endless endless ways there are that only the heavenly father sees and so as the hermit climbed the mountain again he thought -- as he saw the star-like glow of light in the cottage windows far how many god's hidden servants are little gottlieb across the north sea in a country called germany lived a little boy named gottlieb his father had died when he was but a baby and although from early morning till late at night his mother sat plying her needle she found it difficult indeed to provide food and clothing and shelter for her little boy and herself gottlieb was not old enough to work but he would often sit on a small stool at his mother's feet and dream about the wonderful things he would do for his dear mother when he grew to be a man and she was comforted as she looked upon her boy and the thought that she was working for him often gave strength to her tired fingers but one night gottlieb saw that his mother was more than usually troubled every now and then she would sigh and a tear would trickle down her cheek the little boy had grown quick to read these signs of distress and he thought christmas will be here soon and dear mother is thinking of what a sad time it will be what would gottlieb have given to be able to comfort his mother he could only sit and brood while his young heart swelled and a lump rose in his throat at the thought that he could do nothing presently however a happy fancy came to him was not the christ child born on christmas day and did not he send good gifts to men on his birthday but then came the thought he will never find us our home is so mean and small it seemed foolish to hope but a boy is not long cast down and as gottlieb sat dreaming a happy inspiration came to him stealing softly from the room he took paper and pen for he had learnt to write and spelt out word after word a letter which he addressed to the christ child you may be sure that the postman was puzzled what to do with this letter when he sorted it out of the heap in the letter-box perhaps the burgomaster would know the right thing to do so the postman took the letter to the great burly man who lived in the big house and wore a gold chain round his neck the burgomaster opened the envelope and as he read the letter written in the trembling hand of a child tears came into his eyes but he spoke gruffly enough to the postman this must be a foolish boy a small one i have no doubt soon christmas morning dawned and gottlieb woke very early but others were up before him for to his surprise he saw a strange gentleman with his mother his wondering eyes soon perceived other unusual objects for the hearth was piled with wood and the table was loaded with food and dainties such as he had never even imagined gottlieb entered the room just as his mother threw herself at the stranger's feet to bless him for his generous goodness to the widow and orphan nay give me no thanks worthy dame said the visitor rather be grateful to your little son and to the good lord to whom he wrote for aid then he turned to gottlieb with a smile you see that although you wrote to the christ child your prayer for aid came only to the burgomaster the gifts you asked for are here but they come from my hand but gottlieb answered him humbly nay sir the christ child sent them for he put the thought in your heart how the fir tree became the christmas tree when you stand round the christmas tree and look longingly at the toys hanging from the prickly branches it does not occur to you to ask why it is always this particular tree that is so honoured at christmas the dark green fir looks so majestic when laden with bright toys and lit up by christmas candles that perhaps it is not easy to believe that it is the most modest of trees but so it is and because of its humility it was chosen to bear christmas gifts to the children this is the story when the christ child was born all people animals trees and other plants felt that a great happiness had come into the world and truly the heavenly father had sent with the holy babe his blessings of peace and goodwill to all every day people came to see the sweet babe bringing presents in their hands by the stable wherein lay the christ child stood three trees and as the people came and went under their spreading branches they thought that they too would like to give presents to the child said the palm i will choose my biggest leaf and place it as a fan beside the manger to waft soft air to the child and i said the olive i will sprinkle sweet-smelling oil over him what can i give to the child asked the fir you said the others you have nothing to offer your needles would prick the wee babe and your tears are sticky this made the poor fir very unhappy indeed and it said sadly yes you are right i have nothing that would be good enough to offer to the christ child now quite near to the trees had stood an angel who had heard all that had passed he was moved to pity the fir who was so lowly and without envy of the other trees and he resolved to help it high in the dark of the heavens the stars were beginning to twinkle and the angel begged some of the little ones to come down and rest upon the branches of the fir this they were glad to do and their silvery light shone among the branches just like christmas candles from where he lay the christ child could see the great dark evening world and the darker forms of the trees keeping watch like faithful guardians beside the open door of the stable and to its delight the fir tree saw the face of the babe illumined with a heavenly smile as he looked upon the twinkling lights the christ child did not forget the lovely sight and long afterward he bade that to celebrate his birthday there should be placed in every house a fir tree which might be lit up with candles to shine for the children as the stars shone for him on his first birthday was not the fir tree richly rewarded for its meekness surely there is no other tree that shines on so many happy faces the diamond and the dewdrop a costly diamond that had once sparkled in a lady's ring lay in a field amid tall grasses and oxeye daisies just above it was a big dewdrop that clung timidly to a nodding grass-blade overhead the blazing sun shone in all his noonday glory ever since the first pink blush of dawn the modest dewdrop had gazed fixedly down upon the rich gem but feared to address a person of such exalted consequence at last a large beetle during his rambles chanced to espy the diamond and he also recognised him to be some one of great rank and importance sire he said making a low bow permit your humble servant to offer you greeting tha -- nks responded the diamond in languid tones of affectation as the beetle raised his head from his profound bow his gaze happened to alight upon the dewdrop a relative of yours i presume sire he remarked affably waving one of his feelers in the direction of the dewdrop the diamond burst into a rude contemptuous laugh quite too absurd i declare he exclaimed loftily but there what can you expect from a low grovelling beetle away sir pass on your very presence is distasteful to me the idea of placing me upon the same level -- in the same family as a low-born mean insignificant utterly valueless -- -- here the diamond fairly choked for breath but has he not beauty exactly like your own sire the beetle ventured to interpose though with a very timid air beau -- ty flashed the diamond with fine disdain -- the impudent fellow merely apes and imitates me however it is some small consolation to remember that 'imitation is the sincerest flattery ' but even allowing him to possess it mere beauty without rank is ridiculous and worthless a boat without water -- a carriage but no horses -- a well but never a winch such is beauty without rank and wealth there is no real worth apart from rank and wealth combine beauty rank and wealth and you have the whole world at your feet now you know the secret of the world worshipping me and the diamond sparkled and gleamed with vivid violet flashes so that the beetle was glad to shade his eyes the poor dewdrop had listened silently to all that had passed and felt so wounded that at last he wished he never had been born slowly a bright tear fell and splashed the dust just then a skylark fluttered to the ground and eagerly darted his beak at the diamond alas he piped with a great sob of disappointment what i thought to be a precious dewdrop is only a worthless diamond my throat is parched for want of water i must die of thirst really the world will never get over your loss cruelly sneered the diamond but a sudden and noble resolve came to the dewdrop deeply did he repent his foolish wish he could now lay down his life that the life of another might be saved may i help you please he gently asked the lark raised his drooping head oh my precious precious friend if you will you can save my life open your mouth then and the dewdrop slid from the blade of grass tumbled into the parched beak and was eagerly swallowed ah -- well well pondered the beetle as he continued his homeward way i've been taught a lesson that i shall not easily forget yes yes simple worth is far better than rank or wealth without modesty and unselfishness -- and there is no true beauty where these virtues are absent,0,0,0.007409244347057959
the adventures of buster bear by thornton w burgess 1920 i buster bear goes fishing buster bear yawned as he lay on his comfortable bed of leaves and watched the first early morning sunbeams creeping through the green forest to chase out the black shadows once more he yawned and slowly got to his feet and shook himself then he walked over to a big pine-tree stood up on his hind legs reached as high up on the trunk of the tree as he could and scratched the bark with his great claws after that he yawned until it seemed as if his jaws would crack and then sat down to think what he wanted for breakfast while he sat there trying to make up his mind what would taste best he was listening to the sounds that told of the waking of all the little people who live in the green forest he heard sammy jay way off in the distance screaming thief thief and grinned i wonder thought buster if some one has stolen sammy's breakfast or if he has stolen the breakfast of some one else probably he is the thief himself he heard chatterer the red squirrel scolding as fast as he could make his tongue go and working himself into a terrible rage must be that chatterer got out of bed the wrong way this morning thought he he heard blacky the crow cawing at the top of his lungs and he knew by the sound that blacky was getting into mischief of some kind he heard the sweet voices of happy little singers and they were good to hear but most of all he listened to a merry low silvery laugh that never stopped but went on and on until he just felt as if he must laugh too it was the voice of the laughing brook and as buster listened it suddenly came to him just what he wanted for breakfast i'm going fishing said he in his deep grumbly-rumbly voice to no one in particular yes sir i'm going fishing i want some fat trout for my breakfast he shuffled along over to the laughing brook and straight to a little pool of which he knew and as he drew near he took the greatest care not to make the teeniest weeniest bit of noise now it just happened that early as he was some one was before buster bear when he came in sight of the little pool who should he see but another fisherman there who had already caught a fine fat trout who was it why little joe otter to be sure he was just climbing up the bank with the fat trout in his mouth buster bear's own mouth watered as he saw it little joe sat down on the bank and prepared to enjoy his breakfast he hadn't seen buster bear and he didn't know that he or any one else was anywhere near buster bear tiptoed up very softly until he was right behind little joe otter woof woof said he in his deepest most grumbly-rumbly voice that's a very fine looking trout i wouldn't mind if i had it myself little joe otter gave a frightened squeal and without even turning to see who was speaking dropped his fish and dived headfirst into the laughing brook buster bear sprang forward and with one of his big paws caught the fat trout just as it was slipping back into the water here's your trout mr otter said he as little joe put his head out of water to see who had frightened him so come and get it illustration here's your trout mr otter said he page 5 but little joe wouldn't the fact is he was afraid to he snarled at buster bear and called him a thief and everything bad he could think of buster didn't seem to mind he chuckled as if he thought it all a great joke and repeated his invitation to little joe to come and get his fish but little joe just turned his back and went off down the laughing brook in a great rage it's too bad to waste such a fine fish said buster thoughtfully i wonder what i'd better do with it and while he was wondering he ate it all up then he started down the laughing brook to try to catch some for himself ii little joe otter gets even with buster bear little joe otter was in a terrible rage it was a bad beginning for a beautiful day and little joe knew it but who wouldn't be in a rage if his breakfast was taken from him just as he was about to eat it anyway that is what little joe told billy mink perhaps he didn't tell it quite exactly as it was but you know he was very badly frightened at the time i was sitting on the bank of the laughing brook beside one of the little pools he told billy mink and was just going to eat a fat trout i had caught when who should come along but that great big bully buster bear he took that fat trout away from me and ate it just as if it belonged to him i hate him if i live long enough i'm going to get even with him of course that wasn't nice talk and anything but a nice spirit but little joe otter's temper is sometimes pretty short especially when he is hungry and this time he had had no breakfast you know buster bear hadn't actually taken the fish away from little joe but looking at the matter as little joe did it amounted to the same thing you see buster knew perfectly well when he invited little joe to come back and get it that little joe wouldn't dare do anything of the kind where is he now asked billy mink he's somewhere up the laughing brook i wish he'd fall in and get drowned snapped little joe billy mink just had to laugh the idea of great big buster bear getting drowned in the laughing brook was too funny there wasn't water enough in it anywhere except down in the smiling pool and that was on the green meadows where buster had never been known to go let's go see what he is doing said billy mink at first little joe didn't want to but at last his curiosity got the better of his fear and he agreed so the two little brown-coated scamps turned down the laughing brook taking the greatest care to keep out of sight themselves they had gone only a little way when billy mink whispered sh-h there he is sure enough there was buster bear sitting close beside a little pool and looking into it very intently what's he doing asked little joe otter as buster bear sat for the longest time without moving just then one of buster's big paws went into the water as quick as a flash and scooped out a trout that had ventured too near he's fishing exclaimed billy mink and that is just what buster bear was doing and it was very plain to see that he was having great fun when he had eaten the trout he had caught he moved along to the next little pool they are our fish said little joe fiercely he has no business catching our fish i don't see how we are going to stop him said billy mink i do cried little joe into whose head an idea had just popped i'm going to drive all the fish out of the little pools and muddy the water all up then we'll see how many fish he will get just you watch me get even with buster bear little joe slipped swiftly into the water and swam straight to the little pool that buster bear would try next he frightened the fish so that they fled in every direction then he stirred up the mud until the water was so dirty that buster couldn't have seen a fish right under his nose he did the same thing in the next pool and the next buster bear's fishing was spoiled for that day iii buster bear is greatly puzzled buster bear hadn't enjoyed himself so much since he came to the green forest to live his fun began when he surprised little joe otter on the bank of a little pool in the laughing brook and little joe was so frightened that he dropped a fat trout he had just caught it had seemed like a great joke to buster bear and he had chuckled over it all the time he was eating the fat trout when he had finished it he started on to do some fishing himself presently he came to another little pool he stole up to it very very softly so as not to frighten the fish then he sat down close to the edge of it and didn't move buster learned a long time ago that a fisherman must be patient unless like little joe otter he is just as much at home in the water as the fish themselves and can swim fast enough to catch them by chasing them so he didn't move so much as an eye lash he was so still that he looked almost like the stump of an old tree perhaps that is what the fish thought he was for pretty soon two or three swam right in close to where he was sitting now buster bear may be big and clumsy looking but there isn't anything that can move much quicker than one of those big paws of his when he wants it to one of them moved now and quicker than a wink had scooped one of those foolish fish out on to the bank buster's little eyes twinkled and he smacked his lips as he moved on to the next little pool for he knew that it was of no use to stay longer at the first one the fish were so frightened that they wouldn't come back for a long long time at the next little pool the same thing happened by this time buster bear was in fine spirits it was fun to catch the fish and it was still more fun to eat them what finer breakfast could any one have than fresh-caught trout no wonder he felt good but it takes more than three trout to fill buster bear's stomach so he kept on to the next little pool but this little pool instead of being beautiful and clear so that buster could see right to the bottom of it and so tell if there were any fish there was so muddy that he couldn't see into it at all it looked as if some one had just stirred up all the mud at the bottom huh said buster bear it's of no use to try to fish here i would just waste my time i'll try the next pool so he went on to the next little pool he found this just as muddy as the other then he went on to another and this was no better buster sat down and scratched his head it was puzzling yes sir it was puzzling he looked this way and he looked that way suspiciously but there was no one to be seen everything was still save for the laughter of the laughing brook somehow it seemed to buster as if the brook were laughing at him it's very curious muttered buster very curious indeed it looks as if my fishing is spoiled for to-day i don't understand it at all it's lucky i caught what i did it looks as if somebody is trying to -- ha a sudden thought had popped into his head then he began to chuckle and finally to laugh i do believe that scamp joe otter is trying to get even with me for eating that fat trout and then because buster bear always enjoys a good joke even when it is on himself he laughed until he had to hold his sides which is a whole lot better than going off in a rage as little joe otter had done you're pretty smart mr otter you're pretty smart but there are other people who are smart too said buster bear and still chuckling he went off to think up a plan to get the best of little joe otter iv little joe otter supplies buster bear with a breakfast getting even just for spite doesn't always pay fact is it is very apt to work the other way that is just how it came about that little joe otter furnished buster bear with the best breakfast he had had for a long time he didn't mean to do it oh my no the truth is he thought all the time that he was preventing buster bear from getting a breakfast you see he wasn't well enough acquainted with buster to know that buster is quite as smart as he is and perhaps a little bit smarter spite and selfishness were at the bottom of it you see little joe and billy mink had had all the fishing in the laughing brook to themselves so long that they thought no one else had any right to fish there to be sure bobby coon caught a few little fish there but they didn't mind bobby farmer brown's boy fished there too sometimes and this always made little joe and billy mink very angry but they were so afraid of him that they didn't dare do anything about it but when they discovered that buster bear was a fisherman they made up their minds that something had got to be done at least little joe did he'll try it again to-morrow morning said little joe i'll keep watch and as soon as i see him coming i'll drive out all the fish just as i did to-day i guess that'll teach him to let our fish alone so the next morning little joe hid before daylight close by the little pool where buster bear had given him such a fright sure enough just as the jolly sunbeams began to creep through the green forest he saw buster bear coming straight over to the little pool little joe slipped into the water and chased all the fish out of the little pool and stirred up the mud on the bottom so that the water was so muddy that the bottom couldn't be seen at all then he hurried down to the next little pool and did the same thing now buster bear is very smart you know he had guessed the day before who had spoiled his fishing so this morning he only went far enough to make sure that if little joe were watching for him as he was sure he would be he would see him coming then instead of keeping on to the little pool he hurried to a place way down the laughing brook where the water was very shallow hardly over his feet and there he sat chuckling to himself things happened just as he had expected the frightened fish little joe chased out of the little pools up above swam down the laughing brook because you know little joe was behind them and there was nowhere else for them to go when they came to the place where buster was waiting all he had to do was to scoop them out on to the bank it was great fun it didn't take buster long to catch all the fish he could eat then he saved a nice fat trout and waited by and by along came little joe otter chuckling to think how he had spoiled buster bear's fishing he was so intent on looking behind him to see if buster was coming that he didn't see buster waiting there until he spoke i'm much obliged for the fine breakfast you have given me said buster in his deepest most grumbly-rumbly voice i've saved a fat trout for you to make up for the one i ate yesterday i hope we'll go fishing together often then he went off laughing fit to kill himself little joe couldn't find a word to say he was so surprised and angry that he went off by himself and sulked and billy mink who had been watching ate the fat trout v grandfather frog's common-sense there is nothing quite like common sense to smooth out troubles people who have plenty of just plain common sense are often thought to be very wise their neighbors look up to them and are forever running to them for advice and they are very much respected that is the way with grandfather frog he is very old and very wise anyway that is what his neighbors think the truth is he simply has a lot of common sense which after all is the very best kind of wisdom now when little joe otter found that buster bear had been too smart for him and that instead of spoiling buster's fishing in the laughing brook he had really made it easier for buster to catch all the fish he wanted little joe went off down to the smiling pool in a great rage billy mink stopped long enough to eat the fat fish buster had left on the bank and then he too went down to the smiling pool when little joe otter and billy mink reached the smiling pool they climbed up on the big rock and there little joe sulked and sulked until finally grandfather frog asked what the matter was little joe wouldn't tell but billy mink told the whole story when he told how buster had been too smart for little joe it tickled him so that billy had to laugh in spite of himself so did grandfather frog so did jerry muskrat who had been listening of course this made little joe angrier than ever he said a lot of unkind things about buster bear and about billy mink and grandfather frog and jerry muskrat because they had laughed at the smartness of buster he's nothing but a great big bully and thief declared little joe chug-a-rum he may be a bully because great big people are very apt to be bullies and though i haven't seen him i guess buster bear is big enough from all i have heard but i don't see how he is a thief said grandfather frog didn't he catch my fish and eat them snapped little joe doesn't that make him a thief they were no more your fish than mine protested billy mink well our fish then he stole our fish if you like that any better that makes him just as much a thief doesn't it growled little joe grandfather frog looked up at jolly round bright mr sun and slowly winked one of his great goggly eyes there comes a foolish green fly said he who does he belong to nobody snapped little joe what have foolish green flies got to do with my -- i mean our fish nothing nothing at all replied grandfather frog mildly i was just hoping that he would come near enough for me to snap him up then he would belong to me as long as he doesn't he doesn't belong to any one i suppose that if buster bear should happen along and catch him he would be stealing from me according to little joe of course not what a silly idea you're getting foolish in your old age retorted little joe can you tell me the difference between the fish that you haven't caught and the foolish green flies that i haven't caught asked grandfather frog little joe couldn't find a word to say you take my advice little joe otter continued grandfather frog and always make friends with those who are bigger and stronger and smarter than you are you'll find it pays illustration you take my advice little joe otter continued grandfather frog page 26 vi little joe otter takes grandfather frog's advice who makes an enemy a friend to fear and worry puts an end little joe otter found that out when he took grandfather frog's advice he wouldn't have admitted that he was afraid of buster bear no one ever likes to admit being afraid least of all little joe otter and really little joe has a great deal of courage very few of the little people of the green forest or the green meadows would willingly quarrel with him for little joe is a great fighter when he has to fight as for all those who live in or along the laughing brook or in the smiling pool they let little joe have his own way in everything now having one's own way too much is a bad thing it is apt to make one selfish and thoughtless of other people and very hard to get along with little joe otter had his way too much grandfather frog knew it and shook his head very soberly when little joe had been disrespectful to him too bad too bad too bad chug-a-rum it is too bad that such a fine young fellow as little joe should spoil a good disposition by such selfish heedlessness too bad said he so though he didn't let on that it was so grandfather frog really was delighted when he heard how buster bear had been too smart for little joe otter it tickled him so that he had hard work to keep a straight face but he did and was as grave and solemn as you please as he advised little joe always to make friends with any one who was bigger and stronger and smarter than he that was good common sense advice but little joe just sniffed and went off declaring that he would get even with buster bear yet now little joe is good-natured and full of fun as a rule and after he had reached home and his temper had cooled off a little he began to see the joke on himself -- how when he had worked so hard to frighten the fish in the little pools of the laughing brook so that buster bear should not catch any he had all the time been driving them right into buster's paws by and by he grinned it was a little sheepish grin at first but at last it grew into a laugh i believe said little joe as he wiped tears of laughter from his eyes that grandfather frog is right and that the best thing i can do is to make friends with buster bear i'll try it to-morrow morning so very early the next morning little joe otter went to the best fishing pool he knew of in the laughing brook and there he caught the biggest trout he could find it was so big and fat that it made little joe's mouth water for you know fat trout are his favorite food but he didn't take so much as one bite instead he carefully laid it on an old log where buster bear would be sure to see it if he should come along that way then he hid near by where he could watch buster was late that morning it seemed to little joe that he never would come once he nearly lost the fish he had turned his head for just a minute and when he looked back again the trout was nowhere to be seen buster couldn't have stolen up and taken it because such a big fellow couldn't possibly have gotten out of sight again little joe darted over to the log and looked on the other side there was the fat trout and there also was little joe's smallest cousin shadow the weasel who is a great thief and altogether bad little joe sprang at him angrily but shadow was too quick and darted away little joe put the fish back on the log and waited this time he didn't take his eyes off it at last when he was almost ready to give up he saw buster bear shuffling along towards the laughing brook suddenly buster stopped and sniffed one of the merry little breezes had carried the scent of that fat trout over to him then he came straight over to where the fish lay his nose wrinkling and his eyes twinkling with pleasure now i wonder who was so thoughtful as to leave this fine breakfast ready for me said he out loud me said little joe in a rather faint voice i caught it especially for you thank you replied buster and his eyes twinkled more than ever i think we are going to be friends i -- i hope so replied little joe vii farmer brown's boy has no luck at all farmer brown's boy tramped through the green forest whistling merrily he always whistles when he feels light-hearted and he always feels light-hearted when he goes fishing you see he is just as fond of fishing as is little joe otter or billy mink or buster bear and now he was making his way through the green forest to the laughing brook sure that by the time he had followed it down to the smiling pool he would have a fine lot of trout to take home he knew every pool in the laughing brook where the trout love to hide did farmer brown's boy and it was just the kind of a morning when the trout should be hungry so he whistled as he tramped along and his whistle was good to hear when he reached the first little pool he baited his hook very carefully and then taking the greatest care to keep out of sight of any trout that might be in the little pool he began to fish now farmer brown's boy learned a long time ago that to be a successful fisherman one must have a great deal of patience so though he didn't get a bite right away as he had expected to he wasn't the least bit discouraged he kept very quiet and fished and fished patiently waiting for a foolish trout to take his hook but he didn't get so much as a nibble either the trout have lost their appetite or they have grown very wise muttered farmer brown's boy as after a long time he moved on to the next little pool there the same thing happened he was very patient very very patient but his patience brought no reward not so much as the faintest kind of a nibble farmer brown's boy trudged on to the next pool and there was a puzzled frown on his freckled face such a thing never had happened before he didn't know what to make of it all the night before he had dreamed about the delicious dinner of fried trout he would have the next day and now -- well if he didn't catch some trout pretty soon that splendid dinner would never be anything but a dream if i didn't know that nobody else comes fishing here i should think that somebody had been here this very morning and caught all the fish or else frightened them so that they are all in hiding said he as he trudged on to the next little pool i never had such bad luck in all my life before hello what's this there on the bank beside the little pool were the heads of three trout farmer brown's boy scowled down at them more puzzled than ever somebody has been fishing here and they have had better luck than i have thought he he looked up the laughing brook and down the laughing brook and this way and that way but no one was to be seen then he picked up one of the little heads and looked at it sharply it wasn't cut off with a knife it was bitten off he exclaimed i wonder now if billy mink is the scamp who has spoiled my fun thereafter he kept a sharp lookout for signs of billy mink but though he found two or three more trout heads he saw no other signs and he caught no fish this puzzled him more than ever it didn't seem possible that such a little fellow as billy mink could have caught or frightened all the fish or have eaten so many besides he didn't remember ever having known billy to leave heads around that way billy sometimes catches more fish than he can eat but then he usually hides them the farther he went down the laughing brook the more puzzled farmer brown's boy grew it made him feel very queer he would have felt still more queer if he had known that all the time two other fishermen who had been before him were watching him and chuckling to themselves they were little joe otter and buster bear viii farmer brown's boy feels his hair rise 'twas just a sudden odd surprise made farmer brown's boy's hair to rise that's a funny thing for hair to do -- rise up all of a sudden -- isn't it but that is just what the hair on farmer brown's boy's head did the day he went fishing in the laughing brook and had no luck at all there are just two things that make hair rise -- anger and fear anger sometimes makes the hair on the back and neck of bowser the hound and of some other little people bristle and stand up and you know the hair on the tail of black pussy stands on end until her tail looks twice as big as it really is both anger and fear make it do that but there is only one thing that can make the hair on the head of farmer brown's boy rise and as it isn't anger of course it must be fear it never had happened before you see there isn't much of anything that farmer brown's boy is really afraid of perhaps he wouldn't have been afraid this time if it hadn't been for the surprise of what he found you see when he had found the heads of those trout on the bank he knew right away that some one else had been fishing and that was why he couldn't catch any but it didn't seem possible that little billy mink could have eaten all those trout and farmer brown's boy didn't once think of little joe otter and so he was very very much puzzled he was turning it all over in his mind and studying what it could mean when he came to a little muddy place on the bank of the laughing brook and there he saw something that made his eyes look as if they would pop right out of his head and it was right then that he felt his hair rise anyway that is what he said when he told about it afterward what was it he saw what do you think why it was a footprint in the soft mud yes sir that's what it was and all it was but it was the biggest footprint farmer brown's boy ever had seen and it looked as if it had been made only a few minutes before it was the footprint of buster bear now farmer brown's boy didn't know that buster bear had come down to the green forest to live he never had heard of a bear being in the green forest and so he was so surprised that he had hard work to believe his own eyes and he had a queer feeling all over -- a little chilly feeling although it was a warm day somehow he didn't feel like meeting buster bear if he had had his terrible gun with him it might have been different but he didn't and so he suddenly made up his mind that he didn't want to fish any more that day he had a funny feeling too that he was being watched although he couldn't see any one he was being watched little joe otter and buster bear were watching him and taking the greatest care to keep out of his sight all the way home through the green forest farmer brown's boy kept looking behind him and he didn't draw a long breath until he reached the edge of the green forest he hadn't run but he had wanted to huh said buster bear to little joe otter i believe he was afraid and buster bear was just exactly right ix little joe otter has great news to tell little joe otter was fairly bursting with excitement he could hardly contain himself he felt that he had the greatest news to tell since peter rabbit had first found the tracks of buster bear in the green forest he couldn't keep it to himself a minute longer than he had to so he hurried to the smiling pool where he was sure he would find billy mink and jerry muskrat and grandfather frog and spotty the turtle and he hoped that perhaps some of the little people who live in the green forest might be there too sure enough peter rabbit was there on one side of the smiling pool making faces at reddy fox who was on the other side which of course was not at all nice of peter mr and mrs redwing were there and blacky the crow was sitting in the big hickory-tree little joe otter swam straight to the big rock and climbed up to the very highest part he looked so excited and his eyes sparkled so that every one knew right away that something had happened hi cried billy mink look at little joe otter it must be that for once he has been smarter than buster bear little joe made a good-natured face at billy mink and shook his head no billy said he you are wrong altogether wrong i don't believe anybody can be smarter than buster bear illustration reddy glared across the smiling pool at peter page 45 reddy fox rolled his lips back in an unpleasant grin don't be too sure of that he snapped i'm not through with him yet boaster boaster cried peter rabbit reddy glared across the smiling pool at peter i'm not through with you either peter rabbit he snarled you'll find it out one of these fine days reddy reddy smart and sly couldn't catch a buzzing fly taunted peter chug-a-rum said grandfather frog in his deepest gruffest voice we know all about that what we want to know is what little joe otter has got on his mind it's news -- great news cried little joe we can tell better how great it is when we hear what it is replied grandfather frog testily what is it little joe otter looked around at all the eager faces watching him and then in the slowest most provoking way he drawled farmer brown's boy is afraid of buster bear for a minute no one said a word then blacky the crow leaned down from his perch in the big hickory-tree and looked very hard at little joe as he said i don't believe it i don't believe a word of it farmer brown's boy isn't afraid of any one who lives in the green forest or on the green meadows or in the smiling pool and you know it we are all afraid of him little joe glared back at blacky i don't care whether you believe it or not it's true he retorted then he told how early that very morning he and buster bear had been fishing together in the laughing brook and how farmer brown's boy had been fishing there too and hadn't caught a single trout because they had all been caught or frightened before he got there then he told how farmer brown's boy had found a footprint of buster bear in the soft mud and how he had stopped fishing right away and started for home looking behind him with fear in his eyes all the way now tell me that he isn't afraid concluded little joe for once he knows just how we feel when he comes prowling around where we are isn't that great news now we'll get even with him i'll believe it when i see it for myself snapped blacky the crow x buster bear becomes a hero the news that little joe otter told at the smiling pool -- how farmer brown's boy had run away from buster bear without even seeing him -- soon spread all over the green meadows and through the green forest until every one who lives there knew about it of course peter rabbit helped spread it trust peter for that but everybody else helped too you see they had all been afraid of farmer brown's boy for so long that they were tickled almost to pieces at the very thought of having some one in the green forest who could make farmer brown's boy feel fear as they had felt it and so it was that buster bear became a hero right away to most of them a few doubted little joe's story one of them was blacky the crow another was reddy fox blacky doubted because he knew farmer brown's boy so well that he couldn't imagine him afraid reddy doubted because he didn't want to believe you see he was jealous of buster bear and at the same time he was afraid of him so reddy pretended not to believe a word of what little joe otter had said and he agreed with blacky that only by seeing farmer brown's boy afraid could he ever be made to believe it but nearly everybody else believed it and there was great rejoicing most of them were afraid of buster very much afraid of him because he was so big and strong but they were still more afraid of farmer brown's boy because they didn't know him or understand him and because in the past he had tried to catch some of them in traps and had hunted some of them with his terrible gun so now they were very proud to think that one of their own number actually had frightened him and they began to look on buster bear as a real hero they tried in ever so many ways to show him how friendly they felt and went quite out of their way to do him favors whenever they met one another all they could talk about was the smartness and the greatness of buster bear now i guess farmer brown's boy will keep away from the green forest and we won't have to be all the time watching out for him said bobby coon as he washed his dinner in the laughing brook for you know he is very neat and particular and he won't dare set any more traps for me gloated billy mink ah wish brer bear would go up to farmer brown's henhouse and scare farmer brown's boy so that he would keep away from there it would be a favor to me which ah cert'nly would appreciate said unc' billy possum when he heard the news let's all go together and tell buster bear how much obliged we are for what he has done proposed jerry muskrat that's a splendid idea cried little joe otter we'll do it right away caw caw caw broke in blacky the crow i say let's wait and see for ourselves if it is all true of course it's true snapped little joe otter don't you believe i'm telling the truth certainly certainly of course no one doubts your word replied blacky with the utmost politeness but you say yourself that farmer brown's boy didn't see buster bear but only his footprint perhaps he didn't know whose it was and if he had he wouldn't have been afraid now i've got a plan by which we can see for ourselves if he really is afraid of buster bear what is it asked sammy jay eagerly blacky the crow shook his head and winked that's telling said he i want to think it over if you meet me at the big hickory-tree at sun-up to-morrow morning and get everybody else to come that you can perhaps i will tell you xi blacky the crow tells his plan blacky is a dreamer blacky is a schemer his voice is strong when things go wrong blacky is a screamer it's a fact blacky the crow is forever dreaming and scheming and almost always it is of mischief he is one of the smartest and cleverest of all the little people of the green meadows and the green forest and all the others know it blacky likes excitement he wants something going on the more exciting it is the better he likes it then he has a chance to use that harsh voice of his and how he does use it so now as he sat in the top of the big hickory-tree beside the smiling pool and looked down on all the little people gathered there he was very happy in the first place he felt very important and you know blacky dearly loves to feel important they had all come at his invitation to listen to a plan for seeing for themselves if it were really true that farmer brown's boy was afraid of buster bear on the big rock in the smiling pool sat little joe otter billy mink and jerry muskrat on his big green lily-pad sat grandfather frog on another lily-pad sat spotty the turtle on the bank on one side of the smiling pool were peter rabbit jumper the hare danny meadow mouse johnny chuck jimmy skunk unc' billy possum striped chipmunk and old mr toad on the other side of the smiling pool were reddy fox digger the badger and bobby coon in the big hickory-tree were chatterer the red squirrel happy jack the gray squirrel and sammy jay blacky waited until he was sure that no one else was coming then he cleared his throat very loudly and began to speak friends said he everybody grinned for blacky has played so many sharp tricks that no one is really his friend unless it is that other mischief-maker sammy jay who you know is blacky's cousin but no one said anything and blacky went on little joe otter has told us how he saw farmer brown's boy hurry home when he found the footprint of buster bear on the edge of the laughing brook and how all the way he kept looking behind him as if he were afraid perhaps he was and then again perhaps he wasn't perhaps he had something else on his mind you have made a hero of buster bear because you believe little joe's story now i don't say that i don't believe it but i do say that i will be a lot more sure that farmer brown's boy is afraid of buster when i see him run away myself now here is my plan to-morrow morning very early sammy jay and i will make a great fuss near the edge of the green forest farmer brown's boy has a lot of curiosity and he will be sure to come over to see what it is all about then we will lead him to where buster bear is if he runs away i will be the first to admit that buster bear is as great a hero as some of you seem to think he is it is a very simple plan and if you will all hide where you can watch you will be able to see for yourselves if little joe otter is right now what do you say right away everybody began to talk at the same time it was such a simple plan that everybody agreed to it and it promised to be so exciting that everybody promised to be there that is everybody but grandfather frog and spotty the turtle who didn't care to go so far away from the smiling pool so it was agreed that blacky should try his plan the very next morning xii farmer brown's boy and buster bear grow curious ever since it was light enough to see at all blacky the crow had been sitting in the top of the tallest tree on the edge of the green forest nearest to farmer brown's house and never for an instant had he taken his eyes from farmer brown's back door what was he watching for why for farmer brown's boy to come out on his way to milk the cows meanwhile sammy jay was slipping silently through the green forest looking for buster bear so that when the time came he could let his cousin blacky the crow know just where buster was by and by the back door of farmer brown's house opened and out stepped farmer brown's boy in each hand he carried a milk pail right away blacky began to scream at the top of his lungs caw caw caw shouted blacky caw caw caw and all the time he flew about among the trees near the edge of the green forest as if so excited that he couldn't keep still farmer brown's boy looked over there as if he wondered what all that fuss was about as indeed he did but he didn't start to go over and see no sir he started straight for the barn blacky didn't know what to make of it you see smart as he is and shrewd as he is blacky doesn't know anything about the meaning of duty for he never has to work excepting to get enough to eat so when farmer brown's boy started for the barn instead of for the green forest blacky didn't know what to make of it he screamed harder and louder than ever until his voice grew so hoarse he couldn't scream any more but farmer brown's boy kept right on to the barn i'd like to know what you're making such a fuss about mr crow but i've got to feed the cows and milk them first said he now all this time the other little people of the green forest and the green meadows had been hiding where they could see all that went on when farmer brown's boy disappeared in the barn chatterer the red squirrel snickered right out loud ha ha ha this is a great plan of yours blacky ha ha ha he shouted blacky couldn't find a word to say he just hung his head which is something blacky seldom does perhaps if we wait until he comes out again he will come over here said sammy jay who had joined blacky so it was decided to wait it seemed as if farmer brown's boy never would come out but at last he did blacky and sammy jay at once began to scream and make all the fuss they could farmer brown's boy took the two pails of milk into the house then out he came and started straight for the green forest he was so curious to know what it all meant that he couldn't wait another minute now there was some one else with a great deal of curiosity also he had heard the screaming of blacky the crow and sammy jay and he had listened until he couldn't stand it another minute he just had to know what it was all about so at the same time farmer brown's boy started for the green forest this other listener started towards the place where blacky and sammy were making such a racket he walked very softly so as not to make a sound it was buster bear xiii farmer brown's boy and buster bear meet if you should meet with buster bear while walking through the wood what would you do now tell me true i'd run the best i could that is what farmer brown's boy did when he met buster bear and a lot of the little people of the green forest and some from the green meadows saw him when farmer brown's boy came hurrying home from the laughing brook without any fish one day and told about the great footprint he had seen in a muddy place on the bank deep in the green forest and had said his was sure that it was the footprint of a bear he had been laughed at farmer brown had laughed and laughed why said he there hasn't been a bear in the green forest for years and years and years not since my own grandfather was a little boy and that you know was a long long long time ago if you want to find mr bear you will have to go to the great woods i don't know who made that footprint but it certainly couldn't have been a bear i think you must have imagined it then he had laughed some more all of which goes to show how easy it is to be mistaken and how foolish it is to laugh at things you really don't know about buster bear had come to live in the green forest and farmer brown's boy had seen his footprint but farmer brown laughed so much and made fun of him so much that at last his boy began to think that he must have been mistaken after all so when he heard blacky the crow and sammy jay making a great fuss near the edge of the green forest he never once thought of buster bear as he started over to see what was going on when blacky and sammy saw him coming they moved a little farther in to the green forest still screaming in the most excited way they felt sure that farmer brown's boy would follow them and they meant to lead him to where sammy had seen buster bear that morning then they would find out for sure if what little joe otter had said was true -- that farmer brown's boy really was afraid of buster bear now all around behind trees and stumps and under thick branches and even in tree tops were other little people watching with round wide-open eyes to see what would happen it was very exciting the most exciting thing they could remember you see they had come to believe that farmer brown's boy wasn't afraid of anybody or anything and as most of them were very much afraid of him they had hard work to believe that he would really be afraid of even such a great big strong fellow as buster bear every one was so busy watching farmer brown's boy that no one saw buster coming from the other direction you see buster walked very softly big as he is he can walk without making the teeniest weeniest sound and that is how it happened that no one saw him or heard him until just as farmer brown's boy stepped out from behind one side of a thick little hemlock-tree buster bear stepped out from behind the other side of that same little tree and there they were face to face then everybody held their breath even blacky the crow and sammy jay for just a little minute it was so still there in the green forest that not the least little sound could be heard what was going to happen xiv a surprising thing happens blacky the crow and sammy jay looking down from the top of a tall tree held their breath happy jack the gray squirrel and his cousin chatterer the red squirrel looking down from another tree held their breath unc' billy possum sticking his head out from a hollow tree held his breath bobby coon looking through a hole in a hollow stump in which he was hiding held his breath reddy fox lying flat down behind a heap of brush held his breath peter rabbit sitting bolt upright under a thick hemlock branch with eyes and ears wide open held his breath and all the other little people who happened to be where they could see did the same thing you see it was the most exciting moment ever was in the green forest farmer brown's boy had just stepped out from behind one side of a little hemlock-tree and buster bear had just stepped out from behind the opposite side of the little hemlock-tree and neither had known that the other was anywhere near for a whole minute they stood there face to face gazing into each other's eyes while everybody watched and waited and it seemed as if the whole green forest was holding its breath then something happened yes sir something happened farmer brown's boy opened his mouth and yelled it was such a sudden yell and such a loud yell that it startled chatterer so that he nearly fell from his place in the tree and it made reddy fox jump to his feet ready to run and that yell was a yell of fright there was no doubt about it for with the yell farmer brown's boy turned and ran for home as no one ever had seen him run before he ran just as peter rabbit runs when he has got to reach the dear old briar-patch before reddy fox can catch him which you know is as fast as he can run once he stumbled and fell but he scrambled to his feet in a twinkling and away he went without once turning his head to see if buster bear was after him there wasn't any doubt that he was afraid very much afraid everybody leaned forward to watch him what did i tell you didn't i say that he was afraid of buster bear cried little joe otter dancing about with excitement you were right little joe i'm sorry that i doubted it see him go caw caw caw shrieked blacky the crow for a minute or two everybody forgot about buster bear then there was a great crash which made everybody turn to look the other way what do you think they saw why buster bear was running away too and he was running twice as fast as farmer brown's boy he bumped into trees and crashed through bushes and jumped over logs and in almost no time at all he was out of sight altogether it was the most surprising thing that the little people of the green forest ever had seen illustration buster bear was running away too page 71 sammy jay looked at blacky the crow and blacky looked at chatterer and chatterer looked at happy jack and happy jack looked at peter rabbit and peter looked at unc' billy possum and unc' billy looked at bobby coon and bobby looked at johnny chuck and johnny looked at reddy fox and reddy looked at jimmy skunk and jimmy looked at billy mink and billy looked at little joe otter and for a minute nobody could say a word then little joe gave a funny little gasp why why-e-e said he i believe buster bear is afraid too unc' billy possum chuckled ah believe yo' are right again brer otter said he it cert'nly does look so if brer bear isn't scared he must have remembered something impo'tant and has gone to attend to it in a powerful hurry then everybody began to laugh xv buster bear is a fallen hero a fallen hero is some one to whom every one has looked up as very brave and then proves to be less brave than he was supposed to be that was the way with buster bear when little joe otter had told how farmer brown's boy had been afraid at the mere sight of one of buster bear's big footprints they had at once made a hero of buster at least some of them had as this was the first time the very first time that they had ever known any one who lives in the green forest to make farmer brown's boy run away they looked on buster bear with a great deal of respect and were very proud of him but now they had seen buster bear and farmer brown's boy meet face to face and while it was true that farmer brown's boy had run away as fast as ever he could it was also true that buster bear had done the same thing he had run even faster than farmer brown's boy and had hidden in the most lonely place he could find in the very deepest part of the green forest it was hard to believe but it was true and right away everybody lost a great deal of the respect for buster which they had felt it is always that way they began to say unkind things about him they said them among themselves and some of them even said them to buster when they met him or said them so that he would hear them of course blacky the crow and sammy jay who because they can fly have nothing to fear from buster and who always delight in making other people uncomfortable never let a chance go by to tell buster and everybody else within hearing what they thought of him they delighted in flying about through the green forest until they had found buster bear and then from the safety of the tree tops screaming at him buster bear is big and strong his teeth are big his claws are long in spite of these he runs away and hides himself the livelong day a dozen times a day buster would hear them screaming this he would grind his teeth and glare up at them but that was all he could do he couldn't get at them he just had to stand it and do nothing but when impudent little chatterer the red squirrel shouted the same thing from a place just out of reach in a big pine-tree buster could stand it no longer he gave a deep angry growl that made little shivers run over chatterer and then suddenly he started up that tree after chatterer with a frightened little shriek chatterer scampered to the top of the tree he hadn't known that buster could climb but buster is a splendid climber especially when the tree is big and stout as this one was and now he went up after chatterer growling angrily how chatterer did wish that he had kept his tongue still he ran to the very top of the tree so frightened that his teeth chattered and when he looked down and saw buster's great mouth coming nearer and nearer he nearly tumbled down with terror the worst of it was there wasn't another tree near enough for him to jump to he was in trouble this time was chatterer sure enough and there was no one to help him xvi chatterer the red squirrel jumps for his life it isn't very often that chatterer the red squirrel knows fear that is one reason that he is so often impudent and saucy but once in a while a great fear takes possession of him as when he knows that shadow the weasel is looking for him you see he knows that shadow can go wherever he can go there are very few of the little people of the green forest and the green meadows who do not know fear at some time or other but it comes to chatterer as seldom as to any one because he is very sure of himself and his ability to hide or run away from danger but now as he clung to a little branch near the top of a tall pine-tree in the green forest and looked down at the big sharp teeth of buster bear drawing nearer and nearer and listened to the deep angry growls that made his hair stand on end chatterer was too frightened to think if only he had kept his tongue still instead of saying hateful things to buster bear if only he had known that buster could climb a tree if only he had chosen a tree near enough to other trees for him to jump across but he had said hateful things he had chosen to sit in a tree which stood quite by itself and buster bear could climb chatterer was in the worst kind of trouble and there was no one to blame but himself that is usually the case with those who get into trouble nearer and nearer came buster bear and deeper and angrier sounded his voice chatterer gave a little frightened gasp and looked this way and looked that way what should he do what could he do the ground seemed a terrible distance below if only he had wings like sammy jay but he hadn't gr-r-r-r growled buster bear i'll teach you manners i'll teach you to treat your betters with respect i'll swallow you whole that's what i'll do gr-r-r-r oh cried chatterer gr-r-r-r i'll eat you all up to the last hair on your tail growled buster scrambling a little nearer oh oh cried chatterer and ran out to the very tip of the little branch to which he had been clinging now if chatterer had only known it buster bear couldn't reach him way up there because the tree was too small at the top for such a big fellow as buster but chatterer didn't think of that he gave one more frightened look down at those big teeth then he shut his eyes and jumped -- jumped straight out for the far-away ground it was a long long long way down to the ground and it certainly looked as if such a little fellow as chatterer must be killed but chatterer had learned from old mother nature that she had given him certain things to help him at just such times and one of them is the power to spread himself very flat he did it now he spread his arms and legs out just as far as he could and that kept him from falling as fast and as hard as he otherwise would have done because being spread out so flat that way the air held him up a little and then there was his tail that funny little tail he is so fond of jerking when he scolds this helped him too it helped him keep his balance and keep from turning over and over down down down he sailed and landed on his feet of course he hit the ground pretty hard and for just a second he quite lost his breath but it was only for a second and then he was scurrying off as fast as a frightened squirrel could buster bear watched him and grinned i didn't catch him that time he growled but i guess i gave him a good fright and taught him a lesson xvii buster bear goes berrying buster bear is a great hand to talk to himself when he thinks no one is around to overhear it's a habit however it isn't a bad habit unless it is carried too far any habit becomes bad if it is carried too far suppose you had a secret a real secret something that nobody else knew and that you didn't want anybody else to know and suppose you had the habit of talking to yourself you might without thinking you know tell that secret out loud to yourself and some one might just might happen to overhear then there wouldn't be any secret that is the way that a habit which isn't bad in itself can become bad when it is carried too far now buster bear had lived by himself in the great woods so long that this habit of talking to himself had grown and grown he did it just to keep from being lonesome of course when he came down to the green forest to live he brought all his habits with him that is one thing about habits -- you always take them with you wherever you go so buster brought this habit of talking to himself down to the green forest where he had many more neighbors than he had in the great woods let me see let me see what is there to tempt my appetite said buster in his deep grumbly-rumbly voice i find my appetite isn't what it ought to be i need a change yes sir i need a change there is something i ought to have at this time of year and i haven't got it there is something that i used to have and don't have now ha i know i need some fresh fruit that's it -- fresh fruit it must be about berry time now and i'd forgotten all about it my my my how good some berries would taste now if i were back up there in the great woods i could have all i could eat um-m-m-m makes my mouth water just to think of it there ought to be some up in the old pasture there ought to be a lot of 'em up there if i wasn't afraid that some one would see me i'd go up there buster sighed then he sighed again the more he thought about those berries he felt sure were growing in the old pasture the more he wanted some it seemed to him that never in all his life had he wanted berries as he did now he wandered about uneasily he was hungry -- hungry for berries and nothing else by and by he began talking to himself again if i wasn't afraid of being seen i'd go up to the old pasture this very minute seems as if i could taste those berries he licked his lips hungrily as he spoke then his face brightened i know what i'll do i'll go up there at the very first peep of day to-morrow i can eat all i want and get back to the green forest before there is any danger that farmer brown's boy or any one else i'm afraid of will see me that's just what i'll do my i wish to-morrow morning would hurry up and come now though buster didn't know it some one had been listening and that some one was none other than sammy jay when at last buster lay down for a nap sammy flew away chuckling to himself i believe i'll visit the old pasture to-morrow morning myself thought he i have an idea that something interesting may happen if buster doesn't change his mind sammy was on the lookout very early the next morning the first jolly little sunbeams had only reached the green meadows and had not started to creep into the green forest when he saw a big dark form steal out of the green forest where it joins the old pasture it moved very swiftly and silently as if in a great hurry sammy knew who it was it was buster bear and he was going berrying sammy waited a little until he could see better then he too started for the old pasture xviii somebody else goes berrying isn't it funny how two people will often think of the same thing at the same time and neither one know that the other is thinking of it that is just what happened the day that buster bear first thought of going berrying while he was walking around in the green forest talking to himself about how hungry he was for some berries and how sure he was that there must be some up in the old pasture some one else was thinking about berries and about the old pasture too will you make me a berry pie if i will get the berries to-morrow asked farmer brown's boy of his mother of course mrs brown promised that she would and so that night farmer brown's boy went to bed very early that he might get up early in the morning and all night long he dreamed of berries and berry pies he was awake even before jolly round red mr sun thought it was time to get up and he was all ready to start for the old pasture when the first jolly little sunbeams came dancing across the green meadows he carried a big tin pail and in the bottom of it wrapped up in a piece of paper was a lunch for he meant to stay until he filled that pail if it took all day now the old pasture is very large it lies at the foot of the big mountain and even extends a little way up on the big mountain there is room in it for many people to pick berries all day without even seeing each other unless they roam about a great deal you see the bushes grow very thick there and you cannot see very far in any direction jolly round red mr sun had climbed a little way up in the sky by the time farmer brown's boy reached the old pasture and was smiling down on all the great world and all the great world seemed to be smiling back farmer brown's boy started to whistle and then he stopped if i whistle thought he everybody will know just where i am and will keep out of sight and i never can get acquainted with folks if they keep out of sight you see farmer brown's boy was just beginning to understand something that peter rabbit and the other little people of the green meadows and the green forest learned almost as soon as they learned to walk -- that if you don't want to be seen you mustn't be heard so he didn't whistle as he felt like doing and he tried not to make a bit of noise as he followed an old cow-path towards a place where he knew the berries grew thick and oh so big and all the time he kept his eyes wide open and he kept his ears open too that is how he happened to hear a little cry a very faint little cry if he had been whistling he wouldn't have heard it at all he stopped to listen he never had heard a cry just like it before at first he couldn't make out just what it was or where it came from but one thing he was sure of and that was that it was a cry of fright he stood perfectly still and listened with all his might there it was again -- help help help -- and it was very faint and sounded terribly frightened he waited a minute or two but heard nothing more then he put down his pail and began a hurried look here there and everywhere he was sure that it had come from somewhere on the ground so he peered behind bushes and peeped behind logs and stones and then just as he had about given up hope of finding where it came from he went around a little turn in the old cow-path and there right in front of him was little mr gartersnake and what do you think he was doing well i don't like to tell you but he was trying to swallow one of the children of stickytoes the tree toad of course farmer brown's boy didn't let him he made little mr gartersnake set master stickytoes free and held mr gartersnake until master stickytoes was safely out of reach xix buster bear has a fine time buster bear was having the finest time he had had since he came down from the great woods to live in the green forest to be sure he wasn't in the green forest now but he wasn't far from it he was in the old pasture one edge of which touches one edge of the green forest and where do you think he was in the old pasture why right in the middle of the biggest patch of the biggest blueberries he ever had seen in all his life now if there is any one thing that buster bear had rather have above another it is all the berries he can eat unless it be honey nothing can quite equal honey in buster's mind but next to honey give him berries he isn't particular what kind of berries raspberries blackberries or blueberries either kind will make him perfectly happy um-m-m my my but these are good he mumbled in his deep grumbly-rumbly voice as he sat on his haunches stripping off the berries greedily his little eyes twinkled with enjoyment and he didn't mind at all if now and then he got leaves and some green berries in his mouth with the big ripe berries he didn't try to get them out oh my no he just chomped them all up together and patted his stomach from sheer delight now buster had reached the old pasture just as jolly round red mr sun had crept out of bed and he had fully made up his mind that he would be back in the green forest before mr sun had climbed very far up in the blue blue sky you see big as he is and strong as he is buster bear is very shy and bashful and he has no desire to meet farmer brown or farmer brown's boy or any other of those two-legged creatures called men it seems funny but he actually is afraid of them and he had a feeling that he was a great deal more likely to meet one of them in the old pasture than deep in the green forest so when he started to look for berries he made up his mind that he would eat what he could in a great hurry and get back to the green forest before farmer brown's boy was more than out of bed but when he found those berries he was so hungry that he forgot his fears and everything else they tasted so good that he just had to eat and eat and eat now you know that buster is a very big fellow and it takes a lot to fill him up he kept eating and eating and eating and the more he ate the more he wanted you know how it is so he wandered from one patch of berries to another in the old pasture and never once thought of the time somehow time is the hardest thing in the world to remember when you are having a good time jolly round red mr sun climbed higher and higher in the blue blue sky he looked down on all the great world and saw all that was going on he saw buster bear in the old pasture and smiled as he saw what a perfectly glorious time buster was having and he saw something else in the old pasture that made his smile still broader he saw farmer brown's boy filling a great tin pail with blueberries and he knew that farmer brown's boy didn't know that buster bear was anywhere about and he knew that buster bear didn't know that farmer brown's boy was anywhere about and somehow he felt very sure that he would see something funny happen if they should chance to meet um-m-m um-m-m mumbled buster bear with his mouth full as he moved along to another patch of berries and then he gave a little gasp of surprise and delight right in front of him was a shiny thing just full of the finest biggest bluest berries there were no leaves or green ones there buster blinked his greedy little eyes rapidly and looked again no he wasn't dreaming they were real berries and all he had got to do was to help himself buster looked sharply at the shiny thing that held the berries it seemed perfectly harmless he reached out a big paw and pushed it gently it tipped over and spilled out a lot of the berries yes it was perfectly harmless buster gave a little sigh of pure happiness he would eat those berries to the last one and then he would go home to the green forest xx buster bear carries off the pail of farmer brown's boy the question is did buster bear steal farmer brown's boy's pail to steal is to take something which belongs to some one else there is no doubt that he stole the berries that were in the pail when he found it for he deliberately ate them he knew well enough that some one must have picked them -- for whoever heard of blueberries growing in tin pails so there is no doubt that when buster took them he stole them but with the pail it was different he took the pail but he didn't mean to take it in fact he didn't want that pail at all you see it was this way when buster found that big tin pail brimming full of delicious berries in the shade of that big bush in the old pasture he didn't stop to think whether or not he had a right to them buster is so fond of berries that from the very second that his greedy little eyes saw that pailful he forgot everything but the feast that was waiting for him right under his very nose he didn't think anything about the right or wrong of helping himself there before him were more berries than he had ever seen together at one time in all his life and all he had to do was to eat and eat and eat and that is just what he did do of course he upset the pail but he didn't mind a little thing like that when he had gobbled up all the berries that rolled out he thrust his nose into the pail to get all that were left in it just then he heard a little noise as if some one were coming he threw up his head to listen and somehow he never did know just how the handle of the pail slipped back over his ears and caught there this was bad enough but to make matters worse just at that very minute he heard a shrill angry voice shout hi there get out of there he didn't need to be told whose voice that was it was the voice of farmer brown's boy right then and there buster bear nearly had a fit there was that awful pail fast over his head so that he couldn't see a thing of course that meant that he couldn't run away which was the thing of all things he most wanted to do for big as he is and strong as he is buster is very shy and bashful when human beings are around he growled and whined and squealed he tried to back out of the pail and couldn't he tried to shake it off and couldn't he tried to pull it off but somehow he couldn't get hold of it then there was another yell if buster hadn't been so frightened himself he might have recognized that second yell as one of fright for that is what it was you see farmer brown's boy had just discovered buster bear when he had yelled the first time he had supposed that it was one of the young cattle who live in the old pasture all summer but when he saw buster he was just as badly frightened as buster himself in fact he was too surprised and frightened even to run after that second yell he just stood still and stared buster clawed at that awful thing on his head more frantically than ever suddenly it slipped off so that he could see he gave one frightened look at farmer brown's boy and then with a mighty woof he started for the green forest as fast as his legs could take him and this was very fast indeed let me tell you he didn't stop to pick out a path but just crashed through the bushes as if they were nothing at all just nothing at all but the funniest thing of all is this -- he took that pail with him yes sir buster bear ran away with the big tin pail of farmer brown's boy you see when it slipped off his head the handle was still around his neck and there he was running away with a pail hanging from his neck he didn't want it he would have given anything to get rid of it but he took it because he couldn't help it and that brings us back to the question did buster steal farmer brown's boy's pail what do you think xxi sammy jay makes things worse for buster bear thief thief thief thief thief thief sammy jay was screaming at the top of his lungs as he followed buster bear across the old pasture towards the green forest never had he screamed so loud and never had his voice sounded so excited the little people of the green forest the green meadows and the smiling pool are so used to hearing sammy cry thief that usually they think very little about it but every blessed one who heard sammy this morning stopped whatever he was doing and pricked up his ears to listen sammy's cousin blacky the crow just happened to be flying along the edge of the old pasture and the minute he heard sammy's voice he turned and flew over to see what it was all about just as soon as he caught sight of buster bear running for the green forest as hard as ever he could he understood what had excited sammy so he was so surprised that he almost forgot to keep his wings moving buster bear had what looked to blacky very much like a tin pail hanging from his neck no wonder sammy was excited blacky beat his wings fiercely and started after sammy and so they reached the edge of the green forest buster bear running as hard as ever he could sammy jay flying just behind him and screaming thief thief thief at the top of his lungs and behind him blacky the crow trying to catch up and yelling as loud as he could caw caw caw come on everybody come on come on poor buster it was bad enough to be frightened almost to death as he had been up in the old pasture when the pail had caught over his head just as farmer brown's boy had yelled at him then to have the handle of the pail slip down around his neck so that he couldn't get rid of the pail but had to take it with him as he ran was making a bad matter worse now to have all his neighbors of the green forest see him in such a fix and make fun of him was more than he could stand he felt humiliated that is just another way of saying shamed yes sir buster felt that he was shamed in the eyes of his neighbors and he wanted nothing so much as to get away by himself where no one could see him and try to get rid of that dreadful pail but buster is so big that it is not easy for him to find a hiding place so when he reached the green forest he kept right on to the deepest darkest most lonesome part and crept under the thickest hemlock-tree he could find but it was of no use the sharp eyes of sammy jay and blacky the crow saw him they actually flew into the very tree under which he was hiding and how they did scream pretty soon ol' mistah buzzard came dropping down out of the blue blue sky and took a seat on a convenient dead tree where he could see all that went on ol' mistah buzzard began to grin as soon as he saw that tin pail on buster's neck then came others -- redtail the hawk scrapper the kingbird redwing the blackbird drummer the woodpecker welcome robin tommy tit the chickadee jenny wren redeye the vireo and ever so many more they came from the old orchard the green meadows and even down by the smiling pool for the voices of sammy jay and blacky the crow carried far and at the sound of them everybody hurried over sure that something exciting was going on presently buster heard light footsteps and peeping out he saw billy mink and peter rabbit and jumper the hare and prickly porky and reddy fox and jimmy skunk even timid little whitefoot the wood mouse was where he could peer out and see without being seen of course chatterer the red squirrel and happy jack the gray squirrel were there there they all sat in a great circle around him each where he felt safe but where he could see and every one of them laughing and making fun of buster thief thief thief screamed sammy until his throat was sore the worst of it was buster knew that everybody knew that it was true that awful pail was proof of it i wish i never had thought of berries growled buster to himself xxii buster bear has a fit of temper a temper is a bad bad thing when once it gets away there's nothing quite at all like it to spoil a pleasant day buster bear was in a terrible temper yes sir buster bear was having the worst fit of temper ever seen in the green forest and the worst part of it all was that all his neighbors of the green forest and a whole lot from the green meadows and the smiling pool were also there to see it it is bad enough to give way to temper when you are all alone and there is no one to watch you but when you let temper get the best of you right where others see you oh dear dear it certainly is a sorry sight now ordinarily buster is one of the most good-natured persons in the world it takes a great deal to rouse his temper he isn't one tenth so quick tempered as chatterer the red squirrel or sammy jay or reddy fox but when his temper is aroused and gets away from him then watch out it seemed to buster that he had had all that he could stand that day and a little more first had come the fright back there in the old pasture then the pail had slipped down behind his ears and held fast so he had run all the way to the green forest with it hanging about his neck this was bad enough for he knew just how funny he must look and besides it was very uncomfortable but to have sammy jay call everybody within hearing to come and see him was more than he could stand it seemed to buster as if everybody who lives in the green forest on the green meadows or around the smiling brook was sitting around his hiding place laughing and making fun of him it was more than any self-respecting bear could stand with a roar of anger buster bear charged out of his hiding place he rushed this way and that way he roared with all his might he was very terrible to see those who could fly flew those who could climb climbed and those who were swift of foot ran a few who could neither fly nor climb nor run fast hid and lay shaking and trembling for fear that buster would find them in less time than it takes to tell about it buster was alone at least he couldn't see any one illustration those who could fly flew those who could climb climbed page 112 then he vented his temper on the tin pail he cuffed at it and pulled at it all the time growling angrily he lay down and clawed at it with his hind feet at last the handle broke and he was free he shook himself then he jumped on the helpless pail with a blow of a big paw he sent it clattering against a tree he tried to bite it then he once more fell to knocking it this way and that way until it was pounded flat and no one would ever have guessed that it had once been a pail then and not till then did buster recover his usual good nature little by little as he thought it all over a look of shame crept into his face i -- i guess it wasn't the fault of that thing i ought to have known enough to keep my head out of it he said slowly and thoughtfully you got no more than you deserve for stealing farmer brown's boy's berries said sammy jay who had come back and was looking on from the top of a tree you ought to know by this time that no good comes of stealing buster bear looked up and grinned and there was a twinkle in his eyes you ought to know sammy jay said he i hope you'll always remember it thief thief thief screamed sammy and flew away xxiii farmer brown's boy lunches on berries when things go wrong in spite of you to smile's the best thing you can do -- to smile and say i'm mighty glad they are no worse they're not so bad that is what farmer brown's boy said when he found that buster bear had stolen the berries he had worked so hard to pick and then had run off with the pail you see farmer brown's boy is learning to be something of a philosopher one of those people who accept bad things cheerfully and right away see how they are better than they might have been when he had first heard some one in the bushes where he had hidden his pail of berries he had been very sure that it was one of the cows or young cattle who live in the old pasture during the summer he had been afraid that they might stupidly kick over the pail and spill the berries and he had hurried to drive whoever it was away it hadn't entered his head that it could be anybody who would eat those berries when he had yelled and buster bear had suddenly appeared struggling to get off the pail which had caught over his head farmer brown's boy had been too frightened to even move then he had seen buster tear away through the brush even more frightened than he was and right away his courage had begun to come back if he is so afraid of me i guess i needn't be afraid of him said he i've lost my berries but it is worth it to find out that he is afraid of me there are plenty more on the bushes and all i've got to do is to pick them it might be worse he walked over to the place where the pail had been and then he remembered that when buster ran away he had carried the pail with him hanging about his neck he whistled it was a comical little whistle of chagrin as he realized that he had nothing in which to put more berries even if he picked them it's worse than i thought cried he that bear has cheated me out of that berry pie my mother promised me then he began to laugh as he thought of how funny buster bear had looked with the pail about his neck and then because you know he is learning to be a philosopher he once more repeated it might have been worse yes indeed it might have been worse that bear might have tried to eat me instead of the berries i guess i'll go eat that lunch i left back by the spring and then i'll go home i can pick berries some other day chuckling happily over buster bear's great fright farmer brown's boy tramped back to the spring where he had left two thick sandwiches on a flat stone when he started to save his pail of berries my but those sandwiches will taste good thought he i'm glad they are big and thick i never was hungrier in my life hello this he exclaimed right out loud for he had just come in sight of the flat stone where the sandwiches should have been and they were not there no sir there wasn't so much as a crumb left of those two thick sandwiches you see old man coyote had found them and gobbled them up while farmer brown's boy was away but farmer brown's boy didn't know anything about old man coyote he rubbed his eyes and stared everywhere even up in the trees as if he thought those sandwiches might be hanging up there they had disappeared as completely as if they never had been and old man coyote had taken care to leave no trace of his visit farmer brown's boy gaped foolishly this way and that way then instead of growing angry a slow smile stole over his freckled face i guess some one else was hungry too he muttered wonder who it was guess this old pasture is no place for me to-day i'll fill up on berries and then i'll go home so farmer brown's boy made his lunch on blueberries and then rather sheepishly he started for home to tell of all the strange things that had happened to him in the old pasture two or three times as he trudged along he stopped to scratch his head thoughtfully i guess said he at last that i'm not so smart as i thought i was and i've got a lot to learn yet this is the end of the adventures of buster bear in this book because -- guess why because old mr toad insists that i must write a book about his adventures and old mr toad is such a good friend of all of us

it is a characteristic of all things now called efficient which means mechanical and calculated that if they go wrong at all they go entirely wrong there is no power of retrieving a defeat as in simpler and more living organisms a strong gun can conquer a strong elephant but a wounded elephant can easily conquer a broken gun thus the prussian monarchy in the eighteenth century or now can make a strong army merely by making the men afraid but it does it with the permanent possibility that the men may some day be more afraid of their enemies than of their officers thus the drainage in our cities so long as it is quite solid means a general safety but if there is one leak it means concentrated poison -- an explosion of deathly germs like dynamite a spirit of stink thus indeed all that excellent machinery which is the swiftest thing on earth in saving human labour is also the slowest thing on earth in resisting human interference it may be easier to get chocolate for nothing out of a shopkeeper than out of an automatic machine but if you did manage to steal the chocolate the automatic machine would be much less likely to run after you,0,0,0.05593435098072577

this young james todhunter continued the cleric is a very decent man so far as i know but then nobody knows very much he is a bright brownish little fellow agile like a monkey clean-shaven like an actor and obliging like a born courtier he seems to have quite a pocketful of money but nobody knows what his trade is mrs macnab therefore being of a pessimistic turn is quite sure it is something dreadful and probably connected with dynamite the dynamite must be of a shy and noiseless sort for the poor fellow only shuts himself up for several hours of the day and studies something behind a locked door he declares his privacy is temporary and justified and promises to explain before the wedding that is all that anyone knows for certain but mrs macnab will tell you a great deal more than even she is certain of you know how the tales grow like grass on such a patch of ignorance as that there are tales of two voices heard talking in the room though when the door is opened todhunter is always found alone there are tales of a mysterious tall man in a silk hat who once came out of the sea-mists and apparently out of the sea stepping softly across the sandy fields and through the small back garden at twilight till he was heard talking to the lodger at his open window the colloquy seemed to end in a quarrel todhunter dashed down his window with violence and the man in the high hat melted into the sea-fog again this story is told by the family with the fiercest mystification but i really think mrs macnab prefers her own original tale that the other man or whatever it is crawls out every night from the big box in the corner which is kept locked all day you see therefore how this sealed door of todhunter's is treated as the gate of all the fancies and monstrosities of the thousand and one nights' and yet there is the little fellow in his respectable black jacket as punctual and innocent as a parlour clock he pays his rent to the tick he is practically a teetotaller he is tirelessly kind with the younger children and can keep them amused for a day on end and last and most urgent of all he has made himself equally popular with the eldest daughter who is ready to go to church with him tomorrow,0,0,0.047786093146097976

excellent cried that outlaw gaily so far we are all cosy i resume the points of my proclamation so soon to be published to all italy the third item is that of ransom i am asking from the friends of the harrogate family a ransom of three thousand pounds which i am sure is almost insulting to that family in its moderate estimate of their importance who would not pay triple this sum for another day's association with such a domestic circle i will not conceal from you that the document ends with certain legal phrases about the unpleasant things that may happen if the money is not paid but meanwhile ladies and gentlemen let me assure you that i am comfortably off here for accommodation wine and cigars and bid you for the present a sportsman-like welcome to the luxuries of the paradise of thieves,0,0,0.47926735381521773
all the time that he had been speaking the dubious-looking men with carbines and dirty slouch hats had been gathering silently in such preponderating numbers that even muscari was compelled to recognize his sally with the sword as hopeless he glanced around him but the girl had already gone over to soothe and comfort her father for her natural affection for his person was as strong or stronger than her somewhat snobbish pride in his success muscari with the illogicality of a lover admired this filial devotion and yet was irritated by it he slapped his sword back in the scabbard and went and flung himself somewhat sulkily on one of the green banks the priest sat down within a yard or two and muscari turned his aquiline nose on him in an instantaneous irritation,0,0,0.05160068973464331
all my riddles however revolve round our bandit chief resumed the priest reflectively and here is the second of them why did he put so prominently in his demand for ransom the fact that he had taken two thousand pounds from his victim on the spot it had no faintest tendency to evoke the ransom quite the other way in fact harrogate's friends would be far likelier to fear for his fate if they thought the thieves were poor and desperate yet the spoliation on the spot was emphasized and even put first in the demand why should ezza montano want so specially to tell all europe that he had picked the pocket before he levied the blackmail,0,0,0.07933545694680663

father brown was made of two men there was a man of action who was as modest as a primrose and as punctual as a clock who went his small round of duties and never dreamed of altering it there was also a man of reflection who was much simpler but much stronger who could not easily be stopped whose thought was always in the only intelligent sense of the words free thought he could not help even unconsciously asking himself all the questions that there were to be asked and answering as many of them as he could all that went on like his breathing or circulation but he never consciously carried his actions outside the sphere of his own duty and in this case the two attitudes were aptly tested he was just about to resume his trudge in the twilight telling himself it was no affair of his but instinctively twisting and untwisting twenty theories about what the odd noises might mean then the grey sky-line brightened into silver and in the broadening light he realized that he had been to the house which belonged to an anglo-indian major named putnam and that the major had a native cook from malta who was of his communion he also began to remember that pistol-shots are sometimes serious things accompanied with consequences with which he was legitimately concerned he turned back and went in at the garden gate making for the front door,0,0,0.05396838929304867

the major was still looking at him quietly but with protruding eyes when the front door was flung open releasing a flood of gaslight on the face of the fading mist and another figure in pyjamas sprang or tumbled out into the garden the figure was much longer leaner and more athletic the pyjamas though equally tropical were comparatively tasteful being of white with a light lemon-yellow stripe the man was haggard but handsome more sunburned than the other he had an aquiline profile and rather deep-sunken eyes and a slight air of oddity arising from the combination of coal-black hair with a much lighter moustache all this father brown absorbed in detail more at leisure for the moment he only saw one thing about the man which was the revolver in his hand,0,0,0.022380790163283894

you are not sufficiently democratic answered the policeman but you were right when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business i tell you i am sometimes sick of my trade when i see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate but this new movement of ours is a very different affair we deny the snobbish english assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals we remember the roman emperors we remember the great poisoning princes of the renaissance we say that the dangerous criminal is the educated criminal we say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher compared to him burglars and bigamists are essentially moral men my heart goes out to them they accept the essential ideal of man they merely seek it wrongly thieves respect property they merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it but philosophers dislike property as property they wish to destroy the very idea of personal possession bigamists respect marriage or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy but philosophers despise marriage as marriage murderers respect human life they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives but philosophers hate life itself their own as much as other people's,0,0,0.19732251506715592
do not confuse it replied the constable with those chance dynamite outbreaks from russia or from ireland which are really the outbreaks of oppressed if mistaken men this is a vast philosophic movement consisting of an outer and an inner ring you might even call the outer ring the laity and the inner ring the priesthood i prefer to call the outer ring the innocent section the inner ring the supremely guilty section the outer ring -- the main mass of their supporters -- are merely anarchists that is men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness they believe that all the evil results of human crime are the results of the system that has called it crime they do not believe that the crime creates the punishment they believe that the punishment has created the crime they believe that if a man seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as blameless as the flowers of spring they believe that if a man picked a pocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good these i call the innocent section,0,0,0.07881260895143123

with this they emerged out of a narrow street and saw the early sunlight filling leicester square it will never be known i suppose why this square itself should look so alien and in some ways so continental it will never be known whether it was the foreign look that attracted the foreigners or the foreigners who gave it the foreign look but on this particular morning the effect seemed singularly bright and clear between the open square and the sunlit leaves and the statue and the saracenic outlines of the alhambra it looked the replica of some french or even spanish public place and this effect increased in syme the sensation which in many shapes he had had through the whole adventure the eerie sensation of having strayed into a new world as a fact he had bought bad cigars round leicester square ever since he was a boy but as he turned that corner and saw the trees and the moorish cupolas he could have sworn that he was turning into an unknown place de something or other in some foreign town,0,0,0.06010725341521953

ordinarily speaking the proximity of this positive and objective crime would have sobered syme and cured him of all his merely mystical tremors he would have thought of nothing but the need of saving at least two human bodies from being ripped in pieces with iron and roaring gas but the truth was that by this time he had begun to feel a third kind of fear more piercing and practical than either his moral revulsion or his social responsibility very simply he had no fear to spare for the french president or the czar he had begun to fear for himself most of the talkers took little heed of him debating now with their faces closer together and almost uniformly grave save when for an instant the smile of the secretary ran aslant across his face as the jagged lightning runs aslant across the sky but there was one persistent thing which first troubled syme and at last terrified him the president was always looking at him steadily and with a great and baffling interest the enormous man was quite quiet but his blue eyes stood out of his head and they were always fixed on syme,0,0,0.015683569706381687

with pleasure if you don't mind hearing my story replied the eminent foreign philosopher i am by profession an actor and my name is wilks when i was on the stage i mixed with all sorts of bohemian and blackguard company sometimes i touched the edge of the turf sometimes the riff-raff of the arts and occasionally the political refugee in some den of exiled dreamers i was introduced to the great german nihilist philosopher professor de worms i did not gather much about him beyond his appearance which was very disgusting and which i studied carefully i understood that he had proved that the destructive principle in the universe was god hence he insisted on the need for a furious and incessant energy rending all things in pieces energy he said was the all he was lame shortsighted and partially paralytic when i met him i was in a frivolous mood and i disliked him so much that i resolved to imitate him if i had been a draughtsman i would have drawn a caricature i was only an actor i could only act a caricature i made myself up into what was meant for a wild exaggeration of the old professor's dirty old self when i went into the room full of his supporters i expected to be received with a roar of laughter or if they were too far gone with a roar of indignation at the insult i cannot describe the surprise i felt when my entrance was received with a respectful silence followed when i had first opened my lips with a murmur of admiration the curse of the perfect artist had fallen upon me i had been too subtle i had been too true they thought i really was the great nihilist professor i was a healthy-minded young man at the time and i confess that it was a blow before i could fully recover however two or three of these admirers ran up to me radiating indignation and told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next room i inquired its nature it seemed that an impertinent fellow had dressed himself up as a preposterous parody of myself i had drunk more champagne than was good for me and in a flash of folly i decided to see the situation through consequently it was to meet the glare of the company and my own lifted eyebrows and freezing eyes that the real professor came into the room,0,0,0.10513094499832798

my idea is this we must do something to keep the marquis in calais till tomorrow midday i have turned over twenty schemes in my head we cannot denounce him as a dynamiter that is agreed we cannot get him detained on some trivial charge for we should have to appear he knows us and he would smell a rat we cannot pretend to keep him on anarchist business he might swallow much in that way but not the notion of stopping in calais while the czar went safely through paris we might try to kidnap him and lock him up ourselves but he is a well-known man here he has a whole bodyguard of friends he is very strong and brave and the event is doubtful the only thing i can see to do is actually to take advantage of the very things that are in the marquis's favour i am going to profit by the fact that he is a highly respected nobleman i am going to profit by the fact that he has many friends and moves in the best society,0,0,0.2964631951125989

when the jar of the joined iron ran up syme's arm all the fantastic fears that have been the subject of this story fell from him like dreams from a man waking up in bed he remembered them clearly and in order as mere delusions of the nerves -- how the fear of the professor had been the fear of the tyrannic accidents of nightmare and how the fear of the doctor had been the fear of the airless vacuum of science the first was the old fear that any miracle might happen the second the more hopeless modern fear that no miracle can ever happen but he saw that these fears were fancies for he found himself in the presence of the great fact of the fear of death with its coarse and pitiless common sense he felt like a man who had dreamed all night of falling over precipices and had woke up on the morning when he was to be hanged for as soon as he had seen the sunlight run down the channel of his foe's foreshortened blade and as soon as he had felt the two tongues of steel touch vibrating like two living things he knew that his enemy was a terrible fighter and that probably his last hour had come,0,0,0.03156585096761247

but while earth and sky and everything had the living beauty of a thing lost the other half of his head was as clear as glass and he was parrying his enemy's point with a kind of clockwork skill of which he had hardly supposed himself capable once his enemy's point ran along his wrist leaving a slight streak of blood but it either was not noticed or was tacitly ignored every now and then he riposted and once or twice he could almost fancy that he felt his point go home but as there was no blood on blade or shirt he supposed he was mistaken then came an interruption and a change,0,0,0.14892369777717823
