sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr woodhouse's family less as a governess than a friend very fond of both daughters but particularly of emma between them it was more the intimacy of sisters even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being now long passed away they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached and emma doing just what she liked highly esteeming miss taylor's judgment but directed chiefly by her own,1,1,0.9949271908495187
my dear how am i to get so far randalls is such a distance i could not walk half so far,1,1,0.7592313066260157
well that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal of rain here it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast i wanted them to put off the wedding,1,1,0.611692540263575
well said emma willing to let it pass -- you want to hear about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly every body was punctual every body in their best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen oh no we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day,1,1,0.7418949182158217
and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma and a very considerable one -- that i made the match myself i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing,1,1,0.9384330818285648
mr knightley shook his head at her her father fondly replied ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any more matches,1,1,0.8075435243204105
and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess -- i pity you -- i thought you cleverer -- for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it and as to my poor word success ' which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it you have drawn two pretty pictures but i think there may be a third -- a something between the do-nothing and the do-all if i had not promoted mr weston's visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that,1,1,0.9533076090374281
only one more papa only for mr elton poor mr elton you like mr elton papa -- i must look about for a wife for him there is nobody in highbury who deserves him -- and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longer -- and i thought when he was joining their hands to-day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing him a service,1,1,0.9732504220129896
mr elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and i have a great regard for him but if you want to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come and dine with us some day that will be a much better thing i dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to meet him,1,1,0.9689386704145202
a complete change of life became desirable he quitted the militia and engaged in trade having brothers already established in a good way in london which afforded him a favourable opening it was a concern which brought just employment enough he had still a small house in highbury where most of his leisure days were spent and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away he had by that time realised an easy competence -- enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury which he had always longed for -- enough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition,1,1,0.9782501414327996
mr frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved,1,1,0.9778235597642462
mr woodhouse was fond of society in his own way he liked very much to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes from his long residence at hartfield and his good nature from his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle his horror of late hours and large dinner-parties made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms fortunately for him highbury including randalls in the same parish and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining the seat of mr knightley comprehended many such not unfrequently through emma's persuasion he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening parties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card-table for him,1,1,0.9944999069118178
real long-standing regard brought the westons and mr knightley and by mr elton a young man living alone without liking it the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr woodhouse's drawing-room and the smiles of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being thrown away,1,1,0.9716382581828762
she was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired she was short plump and fair with a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features and a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite determined to continue the acquaintance,1,1,0.9635812365272587
upon such occasions poor mr woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare he loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion of his youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat,1,1,0.8603746717817019
harriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile grateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to her early attachment to herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that there was no want of taste though strength of understanding must not be expected altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smith's being exactly the young friend she wanted -- exactly the something which her home required such a friend as mrs weston was out of the question two such could never be granted two such she did not want it was quite a different sort of thing a sentiment distinct and independent mrs weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful for mrs weston there was nothing to be done for harriet every thing,1,1,0.9992917863531443
her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents but harriet could not tell she was ready to tell every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain emma was obliged to fancy what she liked -- but she could never believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered the truth harriet had no penetration she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what mrs goddard chose to tell her and looked no farther,1,1,0.9907671129048897
for some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate cause but as she came to understand the family better other feelings arose she had taken up a wrong idea fancying it was a mother and daughter a son and son's wife who all lived together but when it appeared that the mr martin who bore a part in the narrative and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something or other was a single man that there was no young mrs martin no wife in the case she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she were not taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever,1,1,0.9789509880543464
with this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number and meaning and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr martin and there was evidently no dislike to it harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and obliging he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them and in every thing else he was so very obliging he had his shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her she was very fond of singing he could sing a little himself she believed he was very clever and understood every thing he had a very fine flock and while she was with them he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country she believed every body spoke well of him his mother and sisters were very fond of him mrs martin had told her one day and there was a blush as she said it that it was impossible for any body to be a better son and therefore she was sure whenever he married he would make a good husband not that she wanted him to marry she was in no hurry at all,1,1,0.9816148246844911
well done mrs martin thought emma you know what you are about,1,1,0.9481135305238634
yes to be sure i suppose there are but while i visit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any body can do,1,1,0.9647048832314463
to be sure yes not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up however i do not mean to set up my opinion against your's -- and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it,1,1,0.9870031325749982
they remained but a few minutes together as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face and in a flutter of spirits which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose,1,1,0.9800755398231771
you surprize me emma must do harriet good and by supplying her with a new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure how very differently we feel -- not think they will do each other any good this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma mr knightley,1,1,0.991972579585167
i dare say replied mrs weston smiling that i thought so then -- but since we have parted i can never remember emma's omitting to do any thing i wished,1,1,0.9693576391035521
i should have been sorry mr knightley to be dependent on your recommendation had i quitted mr woodhouse's family and wanted another situation i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held,1,1,0.9885963284310872
not i indeed i only name possibilities i do not pretend to emma's genius for foretelling and guessing i hope with all my heart the young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortune -- but harriet smith -- i have not half done about harriet smith i think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have she knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing she is a flatterer in all her ways and so much the worse because undesigned her ignorance is hourly flattery how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority and as for harriet i will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home i am much mistaken if emma's doctrines give any strength of mind or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life -- they only give a little polish,1,1,0.9981062373819045
pretty say beautiful rather can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogether -- face and figure,1,1,0.5904507798935799
mrs john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy about her sister,1,1,0.9789942396420224
there does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present said mrs weston as can well be and while she is so happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr woodhouse's account i do not recommend matrimony at present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assure you,1,1,0.9975958205725971
i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before,1,1,0.7974740173560971
great has been the pleasure i am sure i never met with a disposition more truly amiable,1,1,0.9166419090989173
the sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite enough pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on there was no want of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure to give a little more height and considerably more elegance she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one the skill of the other and the friendship of both with as many other agreeable associations as mr elton's very promising attachment was likely to add,1,1,0.958226136263607
by all means we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party,1,1,0.7615244608933212
miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted -- observed mrs weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover -- the expression of the eye is most correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes it is the fault of her face that she has them not,1,1,0.9628299546210841
but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer look at the tree,1,1,0.6445243876274306
he was too good -- she could not endure the thought -- she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world -- brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances -- and a very few minutes settled the business,1,1,0.9329135239271195
but what are you in doubt of you must answer it of course -- and speedily,1,1,0.5480292769231888
yes but what shall i say dear miss woodhouse do advise me,1,1,0.9059780601063313
harriet was silent with a little reserve of manner emma continued,1,1,0.9581494280550562
i lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought to refuse him if she can hesitate as to yes ' she ought to say no' directly it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with half a heart i thought it my duty as a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you but do not imagine that i want to influence you,1,1,0.9202995233986574
the symptoms were favourable -- instead of answering harriet turned away confused and stood thoughtfully by the fire and though the letter was still in her hand it was now mechanically twisted about without regard emma waited the result with impatience but not without strong hopes at last with some hesitation harriet said --,1,1,0.8764082741568353
perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just what you ought while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving dear harriet i give myself joy of this it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr martin while you were in the smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me i could not have visited mrs robert martin of abbey-mill farm now i am secure of you for ever,1,1,0.9962143879687362
oh yes very nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always happy with pleasant companions i am quite determined to refuse him but how shall i do what shall i say,1,1,0.9170909100857463
some time afterwards it was i think mrs goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened i am sure miss nash would -- for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married and it is only a linen-draper,1,1,0.9879733923293631
one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school harriet i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes as to any thing superior for you i suppose she is quite in the dark the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of highbury yet hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves,1,1,0.9586593204804033
my picture -- but he has left my picture in bond-street,1,1,0.5551562636122728
i cannot rate her beauty as you do said he but she is a pretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition her character depends upon those she is with but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman,1,1,0.8556490723580051
i am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting,1,1,0.7134370759895095
come said he you are anxious for a compliment so i will tell you that you have improved her you have cured her of her school-girl's giggle she really does you credit,1,1,0.7814270045254504
emma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore said nothing he presently added with a smile,1,1,0.7575615569507747
i do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage,1,1,0.7361857506487992
come said she i will tell you something in return for what you have told me he did speak yesterday -- that is he wrote and was refused,1,1,0.6447018918298325
as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up -- there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune -- her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort -- that she is a gentleman's daughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemen's daughters no one i apprehend will deny -- she is superior to mr robert martin,1,1,0.9206715653905488
i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said mr knightley presently though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed let her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune she may be a parlour-boarder at mrs goddard's all the rest of her life -- or at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writing-master's son,1,1,0.9929231459503461
depend upon it elton will not do elton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match he knows the value of a good income as well as any body elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriet's he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece,1,1,0.9864221809356062
emma remained in a state of vexation too but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her's than in his she did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary's wrong as mr knightley he walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her she was not so materially cast down however but that a little time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy the possibility of the young man's coming to mrs goddard's that morning and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause gave alarming ideas the dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness and when harriet appeared and in very good spirits and without having any such reason to give for her long absence she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind and convinced her that let mr knightley think or say what he would she had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify,1,1,0.9987627641603103
his good friend perry too whom he had spoken to on the subject did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind but he had desired perry to be upon the watch and as he went about so much something he thought might come from that quarter,1,1,0.9165894233969435
the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration he called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady the object of his admiration but which from his manner emma was immediately convinced must be his own,1,1,0.9425327770617246
thy ready wit the word will soon supply may its approval beam in that soft eye,1,0,0.24774404978400957
humph -- harriet's ready wit all the better a man must be very much in love indeed to describe her so ah mr knightley i wish you had the benefit of this i think this would convince you for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken an excellent charade indeed and very much to the purpose things must come to a crisis soon now,1,1,0.9725181135172242
or a trident or a mermaid or a shark oh no shark is only one syllable it must be very clever or he would not have brought it oh miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out,1,1,0.7829684385880336
dear miss woodhouse -- and dear miss woodhouse was all that harriet with many tender embraces could articulate at first but when they did arrive at something more like conversation it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw felt anticipated and remembered just as she ought mr elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment,1,1,0.9835438869238429
whatever you say is always right cried harriet and therefore i suppose and believe and hope it must be so but otherwise i could not have imagined it it is so much beyond any thing i deserve mr elton who might marry any body there cannot be two opinions about him he is so very superior only think of those sweet verses -- to miss -- -- -- -- ' dear me how clever -- could it really be meant for me,1,1,0.9782786734646084
that mr elton should really be in love with me -- me of all people who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas and he the very handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body looks up to quite like mr knightley his company so sought after that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days in the week and so excellent in the church miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury dear me when i look back to the first time i saw him how little did i think -- the two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very good-natured and how beautiful we thought he looked he was arm-in-arm with mr cole,1,1,0.8850099913829886
it is as long again as almost all we have had before,1,0,0.42157458009182197
i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour such things in general cannot be too short,1,1,0.8029110622068415
harriet was too intent on the lines to hear the most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind,1,1,0.7993370317217895
such sweet lines continued harriet -- these two last -- but how shall i ever be able to return the paper or say i have found it out -- oh miss woodhouse what can we do about that,1,1,0.8608761618915362
very well replied emma a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better i shall be pleased but here is my father coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him it will be giving him so much pleasure he loves any thing of the sort and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all -- you must let me read it to him,1,1,0.942238786343581
my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this charade -- you will betray your feelings improperly if you are too conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper while i was by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you do not let us be too solemn on the business he has encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade,1,1,0.891599446508068
aye that's very just indeed that's very properly said very true woman lovely woman ' it is such a pretty charade my dear that i can easily guess what fairy brought it -- nobody could have written so prettily but you emma,1,1,0.9219412529544538
kitty a fair but frozen maid kindled a flame i yet deplore the hood-wink'd boy i called to aid though of his near approach afraid so fatal to my suit before,1,0,0.3530418583221651
the name makes me think of poor isabella for she was very near being christened catherine after her grandmama i hope we shall have her here next week have you thought my dear where you shall put her -- and what room there will be for the children,1,1,0.8678560328227407
mr woodhouse could never allow for mr knightley's claims on his brother or any body's claims on isabella except his own he sat musing a little while and then said,1,1,0.9627587098542758
harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here i am sure she will be pleased with the children we are very proud of the children are not we papa i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john,1,1,0.9552576574693492
aye i wonder which she will poor little dears how glad they will be to come they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet,1,1,0.9431111177666646
he appears rough to you said emma because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough he wishes his boys to be active and hardy and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then but he is an affectionate father -- certainly mr john knightley is an affectionate father the children are all fond of him,1,1,0.8269817098080671
and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way,1,0,0.27349833898337356
but they like it papa there is nothing they like so much it is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way to the other,1,1,0.6512577042148233
oh what a sweet house -- how very beautiful -- there are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much,1,1,0.5643112739669354
she pondered but could think of nothing after a mutual silence of some minutes harriet thus began again --,1,1,0.8185966553485119
i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married or going to be married so charming as you are --,1,1,0.9613975711333468
dear me -- it is so odd to hear a woman talk so --,1,1,0.621816821535937
i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry were i to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing but i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature and i do not think i ever shall and without love i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine fortune i do not want employment i do not want consequence i do not want i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband's house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always right in any man's eyes as i am in my father's,1,1,0.9085745110677838
never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public a single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls but a single woman of good fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross this does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very much to the taste of every body though single and though poor poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a great charm,1,1,0.9714713982105285
dear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself when you grow old,1,0,0.3766228432859945
they were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics were superseded emma was very compassionate and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness her counsel and her patience as from her purse she understood their ways could allow for their ignorance and their temptations had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little entered into their troubles with ready sympathy and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will in the present instance it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to harriet as they walked away,1,1,0.9821497222548822
very true said harriet poor creatures one can think of nothing else,1,1,0.797099305495388
they walked on the lane made a slight bend and when that bend was passed mr elton was immediately in sight and so near as to give emma time only to say farther,1,1,0.8623423272761441
they now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage pales when a sudden resolution of at least getting harriet into the house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot and fall behind to arrange it once more she then broke the lace off short and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently obliged to entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort,1,1,0.8601276743724929
still however though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both and must be leading them forward to the great event,1,1,0.9620200216336711
mr elton must now be left to himself it was no longer in emma's power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures the coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand that first in anticipation and then in reality it became henceforth her prime object of interest and during the ten days of their stay at hartfield it was not to be expected -- she did not herself expect -- that any thing beyond occasional fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers they might advance rapidly if they would however they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no she hardly wished to have more leisure for them there are people who the more you do for them the less they will do for themselves,1,1,0.9656387360130272
mr and mrs john knightley from having been longer than usual absent from surry were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest till this year every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions or seen at all by mr woodhouse who could not be induced to get so far as london even for poor isabella's sake and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit,1,1,0.9958314170309502
he thought much of the evils of the journey for her and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way but his alarms were needless the sixteen miles being happily accomplished and mr and mrs john knightley their five children and a competent number of nursery-maids all reaching hartfield in safety the bustle and joy of such an arrival the many to be talked to welcomed encouraged and variously dispersed and disposed of produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause nor have endured much longer even for this but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by mrs john knightley that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance all the eating and drinking and sleeping and playing which they could possibly wish for without the smallest delay the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them,1,1,0.9873836493530727
mrs john knightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle quiet manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate wrapt up in her family a devoted wife a doating mother and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that but for these higher ties a warmer love might have seemed impossible she could never see a fault in any of them she was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness and with this resemblance of her father she inherited also much of his constitution was delicate in her own health over-careful of that of her children had many fears and many nerves and was as fond of her own mr wingfield in town as her father could be of mr perry they were alike too in a general benevolence of temper and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance,1,1,0.991853826470862
ah my dear said he poor miss taylor -- it is a grievous business,1,1,0.8663098037504215
mr john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of randalls,1,1,0.9456575948134175
where is the young man said john knightley has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not,1,1,0.8257142125047423
my dear papa he is three-and-twenty you forget how time passes,1,1,0.6391449346675381
emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr weston and had half a mind to take it up but she struggled and let it pass she would keep the peace if possible and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits the all-sufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brother's disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was important -- it had a high claim to forbearance,1,1,0.8605495333686083
what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree,1,1,0.6231671574751739
i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child come my dear emma let us be friends and say no more about it tell your aunt little emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now,1,1,0.9286378215330926
the evening was quiet and conversable as mr woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear isabella and the little party made two natural divisions on one side he and his daughter on the other the two mr knightleys their subjects totally distinct or very rarely mixing -- and emma only occasionally joining in one or the other,1,1,0.9656952895486051
mr wingfield most strenuously recommended it sir -- or we should not have gone he recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little bella's throat -- both sea air and bathing,1,1,0.7280223109267833
oh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it either bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr wingfield's which we have been applying at times ever since august,1,1,0.9121812532788622
ah my dear it is not like hartfield you make the best of it -- but after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you different creatures you do not look like the same now i cannot say that i think you are any of you looking well at present,1,1,0.7715989620778126
middling my dear i cannot compliment you i think mr john knightley very far from looking well,1,1,0.9392540050551516
i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well -- but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued i could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr wingfield before you left home,1,1,0.9140804545964321
ah said mr woodhouse shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern -- the ejaculation in emma's ear expressed ah there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to south end it does not bear talking of and for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel after an interval of some minutes however he began with,1,1,0.8503797922178
and moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been to south end south end is an unhealthy place perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end,1,1,0.5459083837746682
ah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred -- better not move at all better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air this is just what perry said it seemed to him a very ill-judged measure,1,1,0.8376559020906336
emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain and when he had reached such a point as this she could not wonder at her brother-in-law's breaking out,1,1,0.8637731993882262
true true cried mr knightley with most ready interposition -- very true that's a consideration indeed -- but john as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive any difficulty i should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps i shall see you at the abbey to-morrow morning i hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion,1,1,0.8673443817673361
mr woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend perry to whom he had in fact though unconsciously been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions -- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil and the immediate alertness of one brother and better recollections of the other prevented any renewal of it,1,1,0.9673032372904918
there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs john knightley in this short visit to hartfield going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister she had nothing to wish otherwise but that the days did not pass so swiftly it was a delightful visit -- perfect in being much too short,1,1,0.9915357156650696
harriet mr elton and mr knightley their own especial set were the only persons invited to meet them -- the hours were to be early as well as the numbers few mr woodhouse's habits and inclination being consulted in every thing,1,1,0.990985694415721
i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr elton it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned with men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please every feature works,1,1,0.8921176191531225
mr elton's manners are not perfect replied emma but where there is a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great deal where a man does his best with only moderate powers he will have the advantage over negligent superiority there is such perfect good-temper and good-will in mr elton as one cannot but value,1,1,0.943795980929264
yes said mr john knightley presently with some slyness he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you,1,1,0.9178190148515134
such an imagination has crossed me i own emma and if it never occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now,1,1,0.852571091031551
emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour the preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice of his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least which mr john knightley did not by any means like he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent,1,1,0.982445076324472
emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving to emulate the very true my love which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all she could not be complying she dreaded being quarrelsome her heroism reached only to silence she allowed him to talk and arranged the glasses and wrapped herself up without opening her lips,1,1,0.9468519890927093
he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope to-morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness such a sad loss to our party to-day,1,1,0.9235992324995317
this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not afford which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour but the very sight of mrs weston her smile her touch her voice was grateful to emma and she determined to think as little as possible of mr elton's oddities or of any thing else unpleasant and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost,1,1,0.9918047126687007
with such sensations mr elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed but she had the comfort of appearing very polite while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again or the substance of it from the open-hearted mr weston -- so it proved -- for when happily released from mr elton and seated by mr weston at dinner he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton to say to her,1,1,0.9867697515942728
oh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill replied isabella and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion to be constantly living with an ill-tempered person must be dreadful it is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery what a blessing that she never had any children poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them,1,1,0.9902093000552932
while he talked to isabella however emma found an opportunity of saying,1,1,0.970657467150722
this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements sir something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow,1,0,0.40969707962367763
mr weston with triumph of a different sort was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time but had not said a word lest it should make mr woodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse for his hurrying away as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke he was afraid they would find no difficulty he wished the road might be impassable that he might be able to keep them all at randalls and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body calling on his wife to agree with him that with a little contrivance every body might be lodged which she hardly knew how to do from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house,1,1,0.9702268067656646
and the bell was rung and the carriages spoken for a few minutes more and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house to get sober and cool and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over,1,1,0.8460191011665257
mr elton this is the most extraordinary conduct and i can account for it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak either to me or of harriet in such a manner command yourself enough to say no more and i will endeavour to forget it,1,1,0.9492563236227591
it is impossible for me to doubt any longer you have made yourself too clear mr elton my astonishment is much beyond any thing i can express after such behaviour as i have witnessed during the last month to miss smith -- such attentions as i have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character indeed which i had not supposed possible believe me sir i am far very far from gratified in being the object of such professions,1,1,0.991037591080921
the hair was curled and the maid sent away and emma sat down to think and be miserable -- it was a wretched business indeed -- such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for -- such a development of every thing most unwelcome -- such a blow for harriet -- that was the worst of all every part of it brought pain and humiliation of some sort or other but compared with the evil to harriet all was light and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken -- more in error -- more disgraced by mis-judgment than she actually was could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself,1,1,0.9732447590227272
to mr john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject for the first start of its possibility there was no denying that those brothers had penetration she remembered what mr knightley had once said to her about mr elton the caution he had given the conviction he had professed that mr elton would never marry indiscreetly and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself it was dreadfully mortifying but mr elton was proving himself in many respects the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him proud assuming conceited very full of his own claims and little concerned about the feelings of others,1,1,0.996733090132156
these were very cheering thoughts and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present,1,1,0.5422761800560639
the weather was most favourable for her though christmas day she could not go to church mr woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas the ground covered with snow and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise every morning beginning in rain or snow and every evening setting in to freeze she was for many days a most honourable prisoner no intercourse with harriet possible but by note no church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day and no need to find excuses for mr elton's absenting himself,1,1,0.9645119354087208
these days of confinement would have been but for her private perplexities remarkably comfortable as such seclusion exactly suited her brother whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions and he had besides so thoroughly cleared off his ill-humour at randalls that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at hartfield he was always agreeable and obliging and speaking pleasantly of every body but with all the hopes of cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with harriet as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease,1,1,0.9952327317260203
the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from mr elton to mr woodhouse a long civil ceremonious note to say with mr elton's best compliments that he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath where in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends he had engaged to spend a few weeks and very much regretted the impossibility he was under from various circumstances of weather and business of taking a personal leave of mr woodhouse of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense -- and had mr woodhouse any commands should be happy to attend to them,1,1,0.9945578366326024
the confession completely renewed her first shame -- and the sight of harriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again,1,1,0.8965310953245866
emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about mr frank churchill's not coming except as a disappointment at randalls the acquaintance at present had no charm for her she wanted rather to be quiet and out of temptation but still as it was desirable that she should appear in general like her usual self she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance and enter as warmly into mr and mrs weston's disappointment as might naturally belong to their friendship,1,1,0.9976802301227288
she was the first to announce it to mr knightley and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary or being acting a part perhaps rather more at the conduct of the churchills in keeping him away she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry the pleasure of looking at somebody new the gala-day to highbury entire which the sight of him would have made and ending with reflections on the churchills again found herself directly involved in a disagreement with mr knightley and to her great amusement perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion and making use of mrs weston's arguments against herself,1,1,0.993781150381136
the churchills are very likely in fault said mr knightley coolly but i dare say he might come if he would,1,1,0.9126181361410497
i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made a point of it it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof,1,1,0.6904674166146847
i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have always set him the example of it it is a great deal more natural than one could wish that a young man brought up by those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too if frank churchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it between september and january a man at his age -- what is he -- three or four-and-twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that it is impossible,1,1,0.9345388367557713
depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it he would feel himself in the right and the declaration -- made of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner -- would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do respect would be added to affection they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims respect for right conduct is felt by every body if he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his,1,1,0.9210102574418708
i suspect they do not satisfy mrs weston they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings standing in a mother's place but without a mother's affection to blind her it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly feel the omission had she been a person of consequence herself he would have come i dare say and it would not have signified whether he did or no can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french not in english he may be very aimable ' have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him,1,1,0.9878149436458361
me -- not at all replied mr knightley rather displeased i do not want to think ill of him i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man but i hear of none except what are merely personal that he is well-grown and good-looking with smooth plausible manners,1,1,0.8495509599084224
you will excuse my being so much over-powered if i find him conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts,1,1,0.7542705439377807
my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable to you he will talk of farming to me of drawing or music and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each that is my idea of him,1,1,0.895962687346326
and mine said mr knightley warmly is that if he turn out any thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing what at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company -- the great man -- the practised politician who is to read every body's character and make every body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself my dear emma your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point,1,1,0.7879873194759569
the house belonged to people in business mrs and miss bates occupied the drawing-room floor and there in the very moderate-sized apartment which was every thing to them the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed the quiet neat old lady who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse and her more active talking daughter almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for their visit solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after mr woodhouse's health cheerful communications about her mother's and sweet-cake from the beaufet -- mrs cole had just been there just called in for ten minutes and had been so good as to sit an hour with them and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much and therefore she hoped miss woodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too,1,1,0.996489386492594
emma's politeness was at hand directly to say with smiling interest --,1,1,0.8878918540809818
have you heard from miss fairfax so lately i am extremely happy i hope she is well,1,1,0.9852344178736406
my mother's deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all by only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over she is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me jane speaks so distinct however she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago which is saying a great deal at my mother's time of life -- and it really is full two years you know since she was here we never were so long without seeing her before and as i was telling mrs cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now,1,1,0.9584815924629408
at this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emma's brain with regard to jane fairfax this charming mr dixon and the not going to ireland she said with the insidious design of farther discovery,1,1,0.9829443518557764
oh no you are very obliging to say such things -- but certainly not there is no comparison between them miss campbell always was absolutely plain -- but extremely elegant and amiable,1,1,0.9760239262347794
and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded she regained the street -- happy in this that though much had been forced on her against her will though she had in fact heard the whole substance of jane fairfax's letter she had been able to escape the letter itself,1,1,0.959974943416996
no my dear said her father instantly that i am sure you are not there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are if any thing you are too attentive the muffin last night -- if it had been handed round once i think it would have been enough,1,1,0.759094179916082
i always told you she was -- a little but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that has its foundation in diffidence what arises from discretion must be honoured,1,1,0.8337006076706028
but where could you hear it cried miss bates where could you possibly hear it mr knightley for it is not five minutes since i received mrs cole's note -- no it cannot be more than five -- or at least ten -- for i had got my bonnet and spencer on just ready to come out -- i was only gone down to speak to patty again about the pork -- jane was standing in the passage -- were not you jane -- for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough so i said i would go down and see and jane said shall i go down instead for i think you have a little cold and patty has been washing the kitchen ' -- oh my dear ' said i -- well and just then came the note a miss hawkins -- that's all i know a miss hawkins of bath but mr knightley how could you possibly have heard it for the very moment mr cole told mrs cole of it she sat down and wrote to me a miss hawkins --,1,1,0.9876817687028545
mr elton going to be married said emma as soon as she could speak he will have every body's wishes for his happiness,1,1,0.9931006862914586
who shall answer that question cried emma my father would say yes ' mr knightley no ' and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium when you have been here a little longer miss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard of perfection in highbury both in person and mind,1,1,0.9920306655557509
very true miss woodhouse so she will he is the very best young man -- but my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr perry miss hawkins -- i dare say an excellent young woman his extreme attention to my mother -- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother is a little deaf you know -- it is not much but she does not hear quite quick jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf he fancied bathing might be good for it -- the warm bath -- but she says it did him no lasting benefit colonel campbell you know is quite our angel and mr dixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him it is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do now here will be mr elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrys -- i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr and mrs perry i say sir turning to mr woodhouse i think there are few places with such society as highbury i always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours -- my dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork -- a roast loin of pork --,1,1,0.9969713946446288
yes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse said miss bates four weeks yesterday -- a miss hawkins -- well i had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts not that i ever -- mrs cole once whispered to me -- but i immediately said no mr elton is a most worthy young man -- but' -- in short i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries i do not pretend to it what is before me i see at the same time nobody could wonder if mr elton should have aspired -- miss woodhouse lets me chatter on so good-humouredly she knows i would not offend for the world how does miss smith do she seems quite recovered now have you heard from mrs john knightley lately oh those dear little children jane do you know i always fancy mr dixon like mr john knightley i mean in person -- tall and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative,1,1,0.9989802063091282
emma alone with her father had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry -- and to marry strangers too -- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject it was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news as proving that mr elton could not have suffered long but she was sorry for harriet harriet must feel it -- and all that she could hope was by giving the first information herself to save her from hearing it abruptly from others it was now about the time that she was likely to call if she were to meet miss bates in her way -- and upon its beginning to rain emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at mrs goddard's and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation,1,1,0.9978847996863925
after much thinking she could determine on nothing better than harriet's returning the visit but in a way that if they had understanding should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance she meant to take her in the carriage leave her at the abbey mill while she drove a little farther and call for her again so soon as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future,1,1,0.9912363256883289
the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again and miss smith receiving her summons was with her without delay and unattended by any alarming young man she came solitarily down the gravel walk -- a miss martin just appearing at the door and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility,1,1,0.9199027909119586
there was no resisting such news no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as mr weston's confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife fewer and quieter but not less to the purpose to know that she thought his coming certain was enough to make emma consider it so and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy it was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits the worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought she hoped mr elton would now be talked of no more,1,1,0.9738984197858372
i shall soon bring him over to hartfield said he at the conclusion,1,1,0.7615344668951436
emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech from his wife,1,1,0.6945691586418539
we had better move on mr weston said she we are detaining the girls,1,1,0.7613451796094025
will mr frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford -- was a question however which did not augur much,1,1,0.9324864581802987
the morning of the interesting day arrived and mrs weston's faithful pupil did not forget either at ten or eleven or twelve o'clock that she was to think of her at four,1,1,0.8617772763492276
he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylor's merits without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouse's character than miss woodhouse miss taylor's and at last as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person,1,1,0.9847847935632753
you cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings said emma were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman,1,1,0.9654862713539689
a reasonable visit paid mr weston began to move -- he must be going he had business at the crown about his hay and a great many errands for mrs weston at ford's but he need not hurry any body else his son too well bred to hear the hint rose immediately also saying,1,1,0.9501638704827401
there is no necessity for my calling this morning said the young man another day would do as well but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which --,1,1,0.9094923062716814
you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you said mr woodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt very worthy people i have known them all my life they will be extremely glad to see you i am sure and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way,1,1,0.9888366358274318
my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me,1,1,0.6045770766680842
emma had hardly expected them for mr weston who had called in for half a minute in order to hear that his son was very handsome knew nothing of their plans and it was an agreeable surprize to her therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together arm in arm she was wanting to see him again and especially to see him in company with mrs weston upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend if he were deficient there nothing should make amends for it but on seeing them together she became perfectly satisfied it was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection and there was time enough for emma to form a reasonable judgment as their visit included all the rest of the morning they were all three walking about together for an hour or two -- first round the shrubberies of hartfield and afterwards in highbury he was delighted with every thing admired hartfield sufficiently for mr woodhouse's ear and when their going farther was resolved on confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma could have supposed,1,1,0.9991250516779986
emma watched and decided that with such feelings as were now shewn it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself that he had not been acting a part or making a parade of insincere professions and that mr knightley certainly had not done him justice,1,1,0.9780176193912754
at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged emma recollected his intended visit the day before and asked him if he had paid it,1,1,0.8034150297244961
yes oh yes -- he replied i was just going to mention it a very successful visit -- i saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me as it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before,1,1,0.967762240119864
he shook his head and laughed -- i cannot separate miss fairfax and her complexion,1,1,0.8430880404175116
at this moment they were approaching ford's and he hastily exclaimed ha this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives as my father informs me he comes to highbury himself he says six days out of the seven and has always business at ford's if it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury i must buy something at ford's it will be taking out my freedom -- i dare say they sell gloves,1,1,0.6301606970076128
i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth,1,1,0.9540120534894774
and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one it is always the lady's right to decide on the degree of acquaintance miss fairfax must already have given her account -- i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow,1,1,0.9724144995437013
you know miss fairfax's situation in life i conclude what she is destined to be,1,1,0.9264820254100551
proof indeed said emma highly amused -- mr dixon is very musical is he we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year,1,1,0.9724467663129178
certainly -- very strong it was to own the truth a great deal stronger than if i had been miss campbell would have been at all agreeable to me i could not excuse a man's having more music than love -- more ear than eye -- a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings how did miss campbell appear to like it,1,1,0.9558912210374313
you are right it was not very flattering to miss campbell but she really did not seem to feel it,1,1,0.8880737367604665
he perfectly agreed with her and after walking together so long and thinking so much alike emma felt herself so well acquainted with him that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting he was not exactly what she had expected less of the man of the world in some of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune therefore better than she had expected his ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr elton's house which as well as the church he would go and look at and would not join them in finding much fault with no he could not believe it a bad house not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having if it were to be shared with the woman he loved he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house there must be ample room in it for every real comfort the man must be a blockhead who wanted more,1,1,0.9851482149116654
emma's very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken the following day by hearing that he was gone off to london merely to have his hair cut a sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast and he had sent for a chaise and set off intending to return to dinner but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut there was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve it did not accord with the rationality of plan the moderation in expense or even the unselfish warmth of heart which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday vanity extravagance love of change restlessness of temper which must be doing something good or bad heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs weston indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general he became liable to all these charges his father only called him a coxcomb and thought it a very good story but that mrs weston did not like it was clear enough by her passing it over as quickly as possible and making no other comment than that all young people would have their little whims,1,1,0.9821738461603938
there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry not so leniently disposed in general he was judged throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury with great candour liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well but there was one spirit among them not to be softened from its power of censure by bows or smiles -- mr knightley the circumstance was told him at hartfield for the moment he was silent but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself over a newspaper he held in his hand hum just the trifling silly fellow i took him for she had half a mind to resent but an instant's observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings and not meant to provoke and therefore she let it pass,1,1,0.9867360328658957
this was the occurrence -- the coles had been settled some years in highbury and were very good sort of people -- friendly liberal and unpretending but on the other hand they were of low origin in trade and only moderately genteel on their first coming into the country they had lived in proportion to their income quietly keeping little company and that little unexpensively but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means -- the house in town had yielded greater profits and fortune in general had smiled on them with their wealth their views increased their want of a larger house their inclination for more company they added to their house to their number of servants to their expenses of every sort and by this time were in fortune and style of living second only to the family at hartfield their love of society and their new dining-room prepared every body for their keeping dinner-company and a few parties chiefly among the single men had already taken place the regular and best families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite -- neither donwell nor hartfield nor randalls nothing should tempt her to go if they did and she regretted that her father's known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish the coles were very respectable in their way but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them this lesson she very much feared they would receive only from herself she had little hope of mr knightley none of mr weston,1,1,0.9932245288724068
it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield which made their presence so acceptable for though her first remark on reading it was that of course it must be declined she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful,1,1,0.9588112816996414
well sir cried mr weston as i took miss taylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will step to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it,1,1,0.9722451129677165
and no great harm if it does said mr woodhouse the sooner every party breaks up the better,1,1,0.8760645616387192
she meant to be very happy in spite of the scene being laid at mr cole's and without being able to forget that among the failings of mr elton even in the days of his favour none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with mr cole,1,1,0.9729229174406848
her father's comfort was amply secured mrs bates as well as mrs goddard being able to come and her last pleasing duty before she left the house was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress to make the two ladies all the amends in her power by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine for whatever unwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal -- she had provided a plentiful dinner for them she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it,1,1,0.9814583480773328
nonsensical girl was his reply but not at all in anger,1,0,0.4228516988971157
or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument -- which must now be shut up in london untouched by any body,1,1,0.7110559005381156
i do not know i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve i smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what there is to question if colonel campbell is not the person who can be,1,1,0.8260844318782852
and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells,1,1,0.7258827601425398
before he could return to his chair it was taken by mrs weston,1,1,0.9275814342362588
my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it i do not want the match -- i do not want to injure dear little henry -- but the idea has been given me by circumstances and if mr knightley really wished to marry you would not have him refrain on henry's account a boy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter,1,1,0.9618748759836525
imprudent if you please -- but not mad excepting inequality of fortune and perhaps a little disparity of age i can see nothing unsuitable,1,1,0.683460798613755
but mr knightley does not want to marry i am sure he has not the least idea of it do not put it into his head why should he marry -- he is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep and his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely fond of his brother's children he has no occasion to marry either to fill up his time or his heart,1,1,0.8281832109214162
for shame emma do not mimic her you divert me against my conscience and upon my word i do not think mr knightley would be much disturbed by miss bates little things do not irritate him she might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would only talk louder and drown her voice but the question is not whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it and i think he does i have heard him speak and so must you so very highly of jane fairfax the interest he takes in her -- his anxiety about her health -- his concern that she should have no happier prospect i have heard him express himself so warmly on those points -- such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte and of her voice i have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever oh and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody -- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the campbells may it not be from mr knightley i cannot help suspecting him i think he is just the person to do it even without being in love,1,1,0.9944174323595808
then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do mr knightley does nothing mysteriously,1,1,0.783237581318099
they combated the point some time longer in the same way emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend for mrs weston was the most used of the two to yield till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over and the instrument in preparation -- and at the same moment mr cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it frank churchill of whom in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs weston she had been seeing nothing except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax followed mr cole to add his very pressing entreaties and as in every respect it suited emma best to lead she gave a very proper compliance,1,1,0.998200914131328
she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable and could accompany her own voice well one accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize -- a second slightly but correctly taken by frank churchill her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song and every thing usual followed he was accused of having a delightful voice and a perfect knowledge of music which was properly denied and that he knew nothing of the matter and had no voice at all roundly asserted they sang together once more and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax whose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could attempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own,1,1,0.9567402868633414
presently mr knightley looked back and came and sat down by her they talked at first only of the performance his admiration was certainly very warm yet she thought but for mrs weston it would not have struck her as a sort of touchstone however she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own,1,1,0.9720229718401083
this present from the campbells said she -- this pianoforte is very kindly given,1,1,0.8626232100323982
that will do said he when it was finished thinking aloud -- you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet,1,1,0.5391986735582681
emma had no longer an alarm for henry his interest was yet safe and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment not more than five couple could be mustered but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful and she found herself well matched in a partner they were a couple worth looking at,1,1,0.9172844224145191
the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax and there she had no doubt she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood -- and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half,1,1,0.9071218164117539
oh if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax,1,1,0.8869890834376104
don't class us together harriet my playing is no more like her's than a lamp is like sunshine,1,0,0.28675228357453003
those who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference the truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised but jane fairfax's is much beyond it,1,1,0.9392037882983976
harriet had business at ford's -- emma thought it most prudent to go with her another accidental meeting with the martins was possible and in her present state would be dangerous,1,1,0.9732083563870241
harriet tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word was always very long at a purchase and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind emma went to the door for amusement -- much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury -- mr perry walking hastily by mr william cox letting himself in at the office-door mr cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone and a string of dawdling children round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread she knew she had no reason to complain and was amused enough quite enough still to stand at the door a mind lively and at ease can do with seeing nothing and can see nothing that does not answer,1,1,0.9286929994093744
he could say no more and with the hope of hartfield to reward him returned with mrs weston to mrs bates's door emma watched them in and then joined harriet at the interesting counter -- trying with all the force of her own mind to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured and that a blue ribbon be it ever so beautiful would still never match her yellow pattern at last it was all settled even to the destination of the parcel,1,1,0.9765700194935587
no trouble in the world ma'am said the obliging mrs ford,1,1,0.888199068089063
what was i talking of said she beginning again when they were all in the street,1,0,0.49997194884601354
he contrived that she should be seated by him and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her and trying to make her help or advise him in his work till jane fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again that she was not immediately ready emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion she must reason herself into the power of performance and emma could not but pity such feelings whatever their origin and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again,1,1,0.984937150429114
whoever colonel campbell might employ said frank churchill with a smile at emma the person has not chosen ill i heard a good deal of colonel campbell's taste at weymouth and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave his friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself do not you think so,1,1,0.9815660207037965
he shook his head with a smile and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy soon afterwards he began again,1,0,0.4177869070700334
he paused she could not but hear she could not avoid answering,1,1,0.7680621793292335
he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter to escape a little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged miss fairfax who was still sitting at it to play something more,1,1,0.9462662411755492
i am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways leave shame to her if she does wrong she ought to feel it,1,1,0.7872539029000438
i do not see much sign of it she is playing robin adair at this moment -- his favourite,1,0,0.4159800296076365
so began miss bates and mr knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,1,1,0.9686594699453853
no i thank you but do come in who do you think is here -- miss woodhouse and miss smith so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte do put up your horse at the crown and come in,1,1,0.8618462825012149
to think of your sending us all your store apples you said you had a great many and now you have not one left we really are so shocked mrs hodges may well be angry william larkins mentioned it here you should not have done it indeed you should not ah he is off he never can bear to be thanked but i thought he would have staid now and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned well returning to the room i have not been able to succeed mr knightley cannot stop he is going to kingston he asked me if he could do any thing,1,1,0.9448358792832066
it may be possible to do without dancing entirely instances have been known of young people passing many many months successively without being at any ball of any description and no material injury accrue either to body or mind -- but when a beginning is made -- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been though slightly felt -- it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more,1,1,0.8947858698711284
the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other might not they use both rooms and dance across the passage it seemed the best scheme and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better emma said it would be awkward mrs weston was in distress about the supper and mr woodhouse opposed it earnestly on the score of health it made him so very unhappy indeed that it could not be persevered in,1,1,0.9304679235272217
well miss woodhouse he almost immediately began your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the terrors of my father's little rooms i bring a new proposal on the subject -- a thought of my father's which waits only your approbation to be acted upon may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball to be given not at randalls but at the crown inn,1,1,0.8820105142960013
yes if you and mr woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful welcome than at randalls it is his own idea mrs weston sees no objection to it provided you are satisfied this is what we all feel oh you were perfectly right ten couple in either of the randalls rooms would have been insufferable -- dreadful -- i felt how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield is not it a good exchange -- you consent -- i hope you consent,1,1,0.9814027647258264
she was obliged to repeat and explain it before it was fully comprehended and then being quite new farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable,1,1,0.7450629527939219
i was going to observe sir said frank churchill that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body's catching cold -- so much less danger at the crown than at randalls mr perry might have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could,1,1,0.9871730103979672
have you indeed sir -- bless me i never could have supposed it but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear however this does make a difference and perhaps when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry if mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done,1,1,0.9263764401321483
so they will my dear that is a great thing not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired -- but is mrs stokes to be trusted i doubt it i do not know her even by sight,1,1,0.8091474088861368
i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs weston's care mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole,1,1,0.9537926192960204
aye very true mr perry did say so i shall never forget it poor little emma you were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for perry's great attention he came four times a day for a week he said from the first it was a very good sort -- which was our great comfort but the measles are a dreadful complaint i hope whenever poor isabella's little ones have the measles she will send for perry,1,1,0.9586055850685016
my father and mrs weston are at the crown at this moment said frank churchill examining the capabilities of the house i left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot i was desired to say so from both it would be the greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there they can do nothing satisfactorily without you,1,1,0.9690518755727031
emma was most happy to be called to such a council and her father engaging to think it all over while she was gone the two young people set off together without delay for the crown there were mr and mrs weston delighted to see her and receive her approbation very busy and very happy in their different way she in some little distress and he finding every thing perfect,1,1,0.9856415133440585
but she is so amusing so extremely amusing i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk and i need not bring the whole family you know,1,1,0.9321133836253177
it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william larkins no -- she was more and more convinced that mrs weston was quite mistaken in that surmise there was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side -- but no love,1,1,0.9877857965968316
emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared but if this reflected at all upon his impatience his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it his dejection was most evident he sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes and when rousing himself it was only to say,1,1,0.8295686181953099
ah that ball -- why did we wait for any thing -- why not seize the pleasure at once -- how often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparation -- you told us it would be so -- oh miss woodhouse why are you always so right,1,1,0.7425246541323164
if i can come again we are still to have our ball my father depends on it do not forget your engagement,1,1,0.5267272982408476
a very friendly shake of the hand a very earnest good-bye closed the speech and the door had soon shut out frank churchill short had been the notice -- short their meeting he was gone and emma felt so sorry to part and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry and feeling it too much,1,1,0.9609038267346183
gratifying however and stimulative as was the letter in the material part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up and returned to mrs weston that it had not added any lasting warmth that she could still do without the writer and that he must learn to do without her her intentions were unchanged her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness his recollection of harriet and the words which clothed it the beautiful little friend suggested to her the idea of harriet's succeeding her in his affections was it impossible -- no -- harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour -- for harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed,1,1,0.997390452800341
harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation emma continued,1,1,0.9251699543091524
you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life -- want gratitude to you -- nobody is equal to you -- i care for nobody as i do for you -- oh miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been,1,1,0.9251577472122686
oh no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all -- a pretty fortune and she came in his way,1,1,0.8149151375208469
when the visit was returned emma made up her mind she could then see more and judge better from harriet's happening not to be at hartfield and her father's being present to engage mr elton she had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself and could composedly attend to her and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that mrs elton was a vain woman extremely well satisfied with herself and thinking much of her own importance that she meant to shine and be very superior but with manners which had been formed in a bad school pert and familiar that all her notions were drawn from one set of people and one style of living that if not foolish she was ignorant and that her society would certainly do mr elton no good,1,1,0.9978084456667728
emma made as slight a reply as she could but it was fully sufficient for mrs elton who only wanted to be talking herself,1,1,0.976171235303023
emma doubted the truth of this sentiment she had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else but it was not worth while to attack an error so double-dyed and therefore only said in reply,1,1,0.8419581268298401
when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield surry is full of beauties,1,1,0.76793573918575
my father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving any benefit and mr perry whose name i dare say is not unknown to you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now,1,1,0.8572158347889217
we have been calling at randalls said she and found them both at home and very pleasant people they seem to be i like them extremely mr weston seems an excellent creature -- quite a first-rate favourite with me already i assure you and she appears so truly good -- there is something so motherly and kind-hearted about her that it wins upon one directly she was your governess i think,1,1,0.9783623979918856
but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride it ought to be no recommendation to you it is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them,1,1,0.9225351520025153
no my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady -- and a bride especially is never to be neglected more is avowedly due to her a bride you know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who they may,1,1,0.9155209048182298
emma had done her father was growing nervous and could not understand her her mind returned to mrs elton's offences and long very long did they occupy her,1,1,0.9688055600514998
there was no reason to suppose mr elton thought at all differently from his wife he seemed not merely happy with her but proud he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury as not even miss woodhouse could equal and the greater part of her new acquaintance disposed to commend or not in the habit of judging following the lead of miss bates's good-will or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself were very well satisfied so that mrs elton's praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do unimpeded by miss woodhouse who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being very pleasant and very elegantly dressed,1,1,0.9969737522980757
you appear to feel a great deal -- but i am not aware how you or any of miss fairfax's acquaintance here any of those who have known her longer than yourself can shew her any other attention than --,1,1,0.9725316648063588
she looked on with some amusement -- miss bates's gratitude for mrs elton's attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth she was quite one of her worthies -- the most amiable affable delightful woman -- just as accomplished and condescending as mrs elton meant to be considered emma's only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate mrs elton as she seemed to do she heard of her walking with the eltons sitting with the eltons spending a day with the eltons this was astonishing -- she could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer,1,1,0.9993246320837951
she must have some motive more powerful than appears for refusing this invitation was emma's conclusion she must be under some sort of penance inflicted either by the campbells or herself there is great fear great caution great resolution somewhere -- she is not to be with the dixons the decree is issued by somebody but why must she consent to be with the eltons -- here is quite a separate puzzle,1,1,0.8611185606481424
i know how highly you think of jane fairfax said emma little henry was in her thoughts and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say,1,1,0.9691822332522978
oh are you there -- but you are miserably behindhand mr cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago,1,1,0.8595695040947261
emma returned her friend's pressure with interest and was pleased enough to exclaim,1,1,0.9066775020625271
emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault well said she and you soon silenced mr cole i suppose,1,1,0.9577324943183293
why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last do not beat me,1,1,0.8464456485097092
i hope you did not venture far miss fairfax this morning or i am sure you must have been wet -- we scarcely got home in time i hope you turned directly,1,1,0.9259399292628956
that is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before the post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives when you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for,1,1,0.7354434580335998
indifferent oh no -- i never conceived you could become indifferent letters are no matter of indifference they are generally a very positive curse,1,1,0.6073324141489578
yes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me,1,1,0.8845453182391151
jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold,1,1,0.9030822417113177
oh my dear but so much as patty has to do -- and it is a kindness to employ our men,1,1,0.7358776659652984
the post-office is a wonderful establishment said she -- the regularity and despatch of it if one thinks of all that it has to do and all that it does so well it is really astonishing,1,1,0.5878653191904586
well well i have that note and can shew it after dinner to convince mr knightley,1,1,0.8562691141654395
but my dear child the time is drawing near here is april and june or say even july is very near with such business to accomplish before us your inexperience really amuses me a situation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you is no everyday occurrence is not obtained at a moment's notice indeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly,1,1,0.8921343752500214
here comes this dear old beau of mine i protest -- only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men -- what a dear creature he is -- i assure you i like him excessively i admire all that quaint old-fashioned politeness it is much more to my taste than modern ease modern ease often disgusts me but this good old mr woodhouse i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner oh i assure you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous i fancy i am rather a favourite he took notice of my gown how do you like it -- selina's choice -- handsome i think but i do not know whether it is not over-trimmed i have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed -- quite a horror of finery i must put on a few ornaments now because it is expected of me a bride you know must appear like a bride but my natural taste is all for simplicity a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery but i am quite in the minority i believe few people seem to value simplicity of dress -- show and finery are every thing i have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin do you think it will look well,1,1,0.8532214793754314
mr weston meanwhile perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting happy and cheerful as usual and with all the right of being principal talker which a day spent anywhere from home confers was making himself agreeable among the rest and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten and spread abroad what public news he had heard was proceeding to a family communication which though principally addressed to mrs weston he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room he gave her a letter it was from frank and to herself he had met with it in his way and had taken the liberty of opening it,1,1,0.9930821575171599
well he is coming you see good news i think well what do you say to it -- i always told you he would be here again soon did not i -- anne my dear did not i always tell you so and you would not believe me -- in town next week you see -- at the latest i dare say for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done most likely they will be there to-morrow or saturday as to her illness all nothing of course but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us again so near as town they will stay a good while when they do come and he will be half his time with us this is precisely what i wanted well pretty good news is not it have you finished it has emma read it all put it up put it up we will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not do now i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way,1,1,0.9316520331066583
yes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london a considerable journey,1,0,0.4814610602098243
no indeed i shall grant you nothing i always take the part of my own sex i do indeed i give you notice -- you will find me a formidable antagonist on that point i always stand up for women -- and i assure you if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at mrs churchill's making incredible exertions to avoid it selina says it is quite horror to her -- and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety she always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution does mrs churchill do the same,1,1,0.9442984721545187
mrs elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was not a fine lady perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it -- and she was considering in what way she had best retract when mr weston went on,1,1,0.9866290765818568
if she is really ill why not go to bath mr weston -- to bath or to clifton she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for her the fact is i suppose that she is tired of enscombe she has now been a longer time stationary there than she ever was before and she begins to want change it is a retired place a fine place but very retired,1,1,0.9251778377777646
this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by and mr weston with a very good grace immediately exclaimed,1,1,0.8722663684927907
my dear madam nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible not heard of you -- i believe mrs weston's letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs elton,1,1,0.9936490592469379
very true mr weston perfectly true it is just what i used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship when because things did not go quite right did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be may before hymen's saffron robe would be put on for us oh the pains i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views the carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage -- one morning i remember he came to me quite in despair,1,1,0.8698931162842349
and i assure you mr weston i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour i have heard so much in praise of mr frank churchill -- at the same time it is fair to observe that i am one of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly guided by others i give you notice that as i find your son so i shall judge of him -- i am no flatterer,1,1,0.9740823823734813
only think well that must be infinitely provoking i have quite a horror of upstarts maple grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves your description of mrs churchill made me think of them directly people of the name of tupman very lately settled there and encumbered with many low connexions but giving themselves immense airs and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall and how they got their fortune nobody knows they came from birmingham which is not a place to promise much you know mr weston one has not great hopes from birmingham i always say there is something direful in the sound but nothing more is positively known of the tupmans though a good many things i assure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother mr suckling who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours it is infinitely too bad mr suckling who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove and whose father had it before him -- i believe at least -- i am almost sure that old mr suckling had completed the purchase before his death,1,1,0.9749958755991568
she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance and yet she could not help rather anticipating something decisive she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis an event a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state,1,1,0.9379127315916626
this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days he was often hoping intending to come -- but was always prevented his aunt could not bear to have him leave her such was his own account at randall's if he were quite sincere if he really tried to come it was to be inferred that mrs churchill's removal to london had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder that she was really ill was very certain he had declared himself convinced of it at randalls though much might be fancy he could not doubt when he looked back that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago he did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her but he could not be prevailed on by all his father's doubts to say that her complaints were merely imaginary or that she was as strong as ever,1,1,0.9915518515916255
it soon appeared that london was not the place for her she could not endure its noise her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering and by the ten days' end her nephew's letter to randalls communicated a change of plan they were going to remove immediately to richmond mrs churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there and had otherwise a fancy for the place a ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged and much benefit expected from the change,1,1,0.98373350691749
emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends -- for the house was taken for may and june she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them almost as often as he could even wish,1,1,0.9786742823724754
emma saw how mr weston understood these joyous prospects he was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered she hoped it was not so two months must bring it to the proof,1,1,0.977483280258075
one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal -- the ball at the crown it had not been forgotten before but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day now however it was absolutely to be every preparation was resumed and very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond a few lines from frank to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at any given time induced them to name as early a day as possible,1,1,0.9874251293696937
emma found that it was not mr weston's fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger they had stopped at mrs bates's door to offer the use of their carriage but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons,1,1,0.979318346123268
i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her i have never seen either mr or mrs elton i have no business to put myself forward,1,1,0.9580875126612437
mr and mrs elton appeared and all the smiles and the proprieties passed,1,1,0.9311825830261186
frank churchill returned to his station by emma and as soon as miss bates was quiet she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of mrs elton and miss fairfax who were standing a little way behind her -- he was thoughtful whether he were overhearing too she could not determine after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look compliments very quietly and properly taken mrs elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself -- and it was how do you like my gown -- how do you like my trimming -- how has wright done my hair -- with many other relative questions all answered with patient politeness mrs elton then said nobody can think less of dress in general than i do -- but upon such an occasion as this when every body's eyes are so much upon me and in compliment to the westons -- who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour -- i would not wish to be inferior to others and i see very few pearls in the room except mine -- so frank churchill is a capital dancer i understand -- we shall see if our styles suit -- a fine young man certainly is frank churchill i like him very well,1,1,0.996526951069992
jane -- repeated frank churchill with a look of surprize and displeasure -- that is easy -- but miss fairfax does not disapprove it i suppose,1,1,0.9850112299889979
mrs gilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing -- miss smith miss smith -- oh -- i had not observed -- you are extremely obliging -- and if i were not an old married man -- but my dancing days are over mrs weston you will excuse me any thing else i should be most happy to do at your command -- but my dancing days are over,1,1,0.9849838005809297
not your vain spirit but your serious spirit -- if one leads you wrong i am sure the other tells you of it,1,0,0.395165156489664
and in return for your acknowledging so much i will do you the justice to say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself -- harriet smith has some first-rate qualities which mrs elton is totally without an unpretending single-minded artless girl -- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs elton i found harriet more conversable than i expected,1,1,0.9872854545845025
emma was extremely gratified -- they were interrupted by the bustle of mr weston calling on every body to begin dancing again,1,1,0.9737934064066236
come miss woodhouse miss otway miss fairfax what are you all doing -- come emma set your companions the example every body is lazy every body is asleep,1,1,0.9278418293485564
emma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed -- aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible within half an hour it was known all over highbury it was the very event to engage those who talk most the young and the low and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news the last night's ball seemed lost in the gipsies poor mr woodhouse trembled as he sat and as emma had foreseen would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again it was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after as well as miss smith were coming in during the rest of the day and he had the pleasure of returning for answer that they were all very indifferent -- which though not exactly true for she was perfectly well and harriet not much otherwise emma would not interfere with she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man for she hardly knew what indisposition was and if he did not invent illnesses for her she could make no figure in a message,1,1,0.9967523757620893
i do remember it cried emma i perfectly remember it -- talking about spruce-beer -- oh yes -- mr knightley and i both saying we liked it and mr elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too i perfectly remember it -- stop mr knightley was standing just here was not he i have an idea he was standing just here,1,1,0.9101942933492657
my poor dear harriet and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things,1,1,0.8622652763248123
emma then looked up and immediately saw how it was and after a moment's debate as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not replied,1,1,0.6969077071183469
she then took a longer time for consideration should she proceed no farther -- should she let it pass and seem to suspect nothing -- perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did or perhaps if she were totally silent it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too much and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances she was perfectly resolved -- she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once all that she meant to say and know plain dealing was always best she had previously determined how far she would proceed on any application of the sort and it would be safer for both to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed -- she was decided and thus spoke --,1,1,0.9769709098640429
harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning your resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you is not it so,1,1,0.9482127772746602
as they were turning into the grounds mr perry passed by on horseback the gentlemen spoke of his horse,1,1,0.7421402736037251
never really never -- bless me how could it be -- then i must have dreamt it -- but i was completely persuaded -- miss smith you walk as if you were tired you will not be sorry to find yourself at home,1,1,0.9446285869652322
why to own the truth cried miss bates who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes if i must speak on this subject there is no denying that mr frank churchill might have -- i do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days mrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed jane don't you remember grandmama's telling us of it when we got home i forget where we had been walking to -- very likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls mrs perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed i do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to this i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of at the same time i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware i am a talker you know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not i am not like jane i wish i were i will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world where is she -- oh just behind perfectly remember mrs perry's coming -- extraordinary dream indeed,1,1,0.9929733679342196
with great indignation did he continue to observe him with great alarm and distrust to observe also his two blinded companions he saw a short word prepared for emma and given to her with a look sly and demure he saw that emma had soon made it out and found it highly entertaining though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure for she said nonsense for shame he heard frank churchill next say with a glance towards jane i will give it to her -- shall i -- and as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth no no you must not you shall not indeed,1,1,0.9817927711424792
he had hoped she would speak again but she did not she would rather busy herself about any thing than speak he sat a little while in doubt a variety of evils crossed his mind interference -- fruitless interference emma's confusion and the acknowledged intimacy seemed to declare her affection engaged yet he would speak he owed it to her to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference rather than her welfare to encounter any thing rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause,1,1,0.9759191469171238
this was so very well understood between them that emma could not but feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing from mr weston that he had been proposing to mrs elton as her brother and sister had failed her that the two parties should unite and go together and that as mrs elton had very readily acceded to it so it was to be if she had no objection now as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs elton of which mr weston must already be perfectly aware it was not worth bringing forward again -- it could not be done without a reproof to him which would be giving pain to his wife and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of mrs elton's party every feeling was offended and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr weston's temper,1,1,0.9994122521697812
i will answer for it that mine thinks herself full as clever and would spurn any body's assistance,1,1,0.6902767104912557
he was invited on good faith no lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity he did consent he had not been at donwell for two years some very fine morning he and emma and harriet could go very well and he could sit still with mrs weston while the dear girls walked about the gardens he did not suppose they could be damp now in the middle of the day he should like to see the old house again exceedingly and should be very happy to meet mr and mrs elton and any other of his neighbours -- he could not see any objection at all to his and emma's and harriet's going there some very fine morning he thought it very well done of mr knightley to invite them -- very kind and sensible -- much cleverer than dining out -- he was not fond of dining out,1,1,0.9919578040415143
it was so long since emma had been at the abbey that as soon as she was satisfied of her father's comfort she was glad to leave him and look around her eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family,1,1,0.9789902732376169
it was hot and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered dispersed way scarcely any three together they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds -- it led to nothing nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars which seemed intended in their erection to give the appearance of an approach to the house which never had been there disputable however as might be the taste of such a termination it was in itself a charming walk and the view which closed it extremely pretty -- the considerable slope at nearly the foot of which the abbey stood gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood -- and at the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered rose the abbey mill farm with meadows in front and the river making a close and handsome curve around it,1,0,0.3417996160739704
certainly if you wish it -- but you are not going to walk to highbury alone,1,1,0.7650223791280251
thank you thank you -- but on no account -- i would rather walk -- and for me to be afraid of walking alone -- i who may so soon have to guard others,1,1,0.692828352842353
jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour and they had only accomplished some views of st mark's place venice when frank churchill entered the room emma had not been thinking of him she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him mrs weston would be at ease the black mare was blameless they were right who had named mrs churchill as the cause he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her a nervous seizure which had lasted some hours -- and he had quite given up every thought of coming till very late -- and had he known how hot a ride he should have and how late with all his hurry he must be he believed he should not have come at all the heat was excessive he had never suffered any thing like it -- almost wished he had staid at home -- nothing killed him like heat -- he could bear any degree of cold etc but heat was intolerable -- and he sat down at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr woodhouse's fire looking very deplorable,1,1,0.9807653758552792
emma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchill's state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour some people were always cross when they were hot such might be his constitution and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints she recommended his taking some refreshment he would find abundance of every thing in the dining-room -- and she humanely pointed out the door,1,1,0.9221070724413827
no -- he should not eat he was not hungry it would only make him hotter in two minutes however he relented in his own favour and muttering something about spruce-beer walked off emma returned all her attention to her father saying in secret --,1,1,0.8382619541216282
they may be induced to go too a warm climate may be prescribed for her i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad i assure you i have i feel a strong persuasion this morning that i shall soon be abroad i ought to travel i am tired of doing nothing i want a change i am serious miss woodhouse whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy -- i am sick of england -- and would leave it to-morrow if i could,1,1,0.9481349821890781
you are sick of prosperity and indulgence cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay,1,1,0.6373874092791113
i sick of prosperity and indulgence you are quite mistaken i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged i am thwarted in every thing material i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person,1,1,0.8260660630869491
but if i do i shall be crosser still i can never bear to think of you all there without me,1,1,0.549748030856642
don't say i was cross i was fatigued the heat overcame me,1,0,0.271099310102759
dating from three o'clock yesterday my perpetual influence could not begin earlier or you would not have been so much out of humour before,1,1,0.7594680809616513
three o'clock yesterday that is your date i thought i had seen you first in february,1,1,0.6517943996918599
her mutterings were chiefly to her husband and he murmured in reply,1,1,0.6744262503740777
ah -- well -- to be sure yes i see what she means turning to mr knightley and i will try to hold my tongue i must make myself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend,1,1,0.8338098516964054
low i am afraid sir very low answered his son -- but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way,1,0,0.3948693605456528
no no said emma it will not reckon low a conundrum of mr weston's shall clear him and his next neighbour come sir pray let me hear it,1,1,0.7746206428972047
ah you will never guess you to emma i am certain will never guess -- i will tell you -- m and a -- em-ma -- do you understand,1,1,0.6573397693017959
this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else perfection should not have come quite so soon,1,1,0.8806695200771316
oh for myself i protest i must be excused said mrs elton i really cannot attempt -- i am not at all fond of the sort of thing i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which i was not at all pleased with i knew who it came from an abominable puppy -- you know who i mean nodding to her husband these kind of things are very well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire but quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring about the country in summer miss woodhouse must excuse me i am not one of those who have witty things at every body's service i do not pretend to be a wit i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue pass us if you please mr churchill pass mr e knightley jane and myself we have nothing clever to say -- not one of us,1,1,0.9331486424506794
jane declined it however and the husband and wife walked off happy couple said frank churchill as soon as they were out of hearing -- how well they suit one another -- very lucky -- marrying as they did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place -- they only knew each other i think a few weeks in bath peculiarly lucky -- for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that bath or any public place can give -- it is all nothing there can be no knowledge it is only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as they always are that you can form any just judgment short of that it is all guess and luck -- and will generally be ill-luck how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest of his life,1,1,0.9848018553048224
i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them to be very frequent a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise -- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards i would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever,1,1,0.9610972499115389
he made no answer merely looked and bowed in submission and soon afterwards said in a lively tone,1,1,0.6097068281506958
nay how could i help saying what i did -- nobody could have helped it it was not so very bad i dare say she did not understand me,1,1,0.7594160768393696
whenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends -- but i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible -- i mean as to the character and manners of the family,1,1,0.9535279894955024
very soon very soon indeed that's the worst of it within a fortnight mrs smallridge is in a great hurry my poor mother does not know how to bear it so then i try to put it out of her thoughts and say come ma'am do not let us think about it any more,1,1,0.8933410999645163
aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte what is to become of that -- very true poor dear jane was talking of it just now -- you must go ' said she you and i must part you will have no business here -- let it stay however ' said she give it houseroom till colonel campbell comes back i shall talk about it to him he will settle for me he will help me out of all my difficulties ' -- and to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter's,1,1,0.8996507937004641
it was felt as such things must be felt every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow tenderness towards the departed solicitude for the surviving friends and in a reasonable time curiosity to know where she would be buried goldsmith tells us that when lovely woman stoops to folly she has nothing to do but to die and when she stoops to be disagreeable it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame mrs churchill after being disliked at least twenty-five years was now spoken of with compassionate allowances in one point she was fully justified she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill the event acquitted her of all the fancifulness and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints,1,1,0.9626049967459797
to guess what all this meant was impossible even for emma something really important seemed announced by his looks but as her friend was well she endeavoured not to be uneasy and settling it with her father that she would take her walk now she and mr weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for randalls,1,1,0.9623001294346165
mr weston do not trifle with me -- consider how many of my dearest friends are now in brunswick square which of them is it -- i charge you by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment,1,1,0.7619002807268844
i was wrong he continued in talking of its being broke to you i should not have used the expression in fact it does not concern you -- it concerns only myself -- that is we hope -- humph -- in short my dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it i don't say that it is not a disagreeable business -- but things might be much worse -- if we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls,1,1,0.9031267633500227
i do not know -- one of the otways -- not frank -- it is not frank i assure you you will not see him he is half way to windsor by this time,1,1,0.8430381907042904
they hurried on and were speedily at randalls -- well my dear said he as they entered the room -- i have brought her and now i hope you will soon be better i shall leave you together there is no use in delay i shall not be far off if you want me -- and emma distinctly heard him add in a lower tone before he quitted the room -- i have been as good as my word she has not the least idea,1,1,0.9459700225610056
emma even jumped with surprize -- and horror-struck exclaimed,1,1,0.6801687514563931
jane fairfax -- good god you are not serious you do not mean it,1,1,0.7916999420477505
you may well be amazed returned mrs weston still averting her eyes and talking on with eagerness that emma might have time to recover -- you may well be amazed but it is even so there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since october -- formed at weymouth and kept a secret from every body not a creature knowing it but themselves -- neither the campbells nor her family nor his -- it is so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact it is yet almost incredible to myself i can hardly believe it -- i thought i knew him,1,1,0.9659814947002231
emma scarcely heard what was said -- her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about miss fairfax and poor harriet -- and for some time she could only exclaim and require confirmation repeated confirmation,1,1,0.969842929976172
well said she at last trying to recover herself this is a circumstance which i must think of at least half a day before i can at all comprehend it what -- engaged to her all the winter -- before either of them came to highbury,1,1,0.9305466794998232
engaged since october -- secretly engaged -- it has hurt me emma very much it has hurt his father equally some part of his conduct we cannot excuse,1,1,0.8578876390933918
emma pondered a moment and then replied i will not pretend not to understand you and to give you all the relief in my power be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me as you are apprehensive of,1,1,0.9081824736924653
i have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself but this does not acquit him mrs weston and i must say that i think him greatly to blame what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners so very disengaged what right had he to endeavour to please as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another -- how could he tell what mischief he might be doing -- how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him -- very wrong very wrong indeed,1,1,0.9347513361686627
nay dear emma now i must take his part for though he has been wrong in this instance i have known him long enough to answer for his having many very many good qualities and --,1,1,0.820199343936266
most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty conceive what the events of a week have done in that family while poor mrs churchill lived i suppose there could not have been a hope a chance a possibility -- but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required what a blessing it is when undue influence does not survive the grave -- he gave his consent with very little persuasion,1,1,0.9693502703806456
none not one he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves,1,1,0.5472789256535732
true but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her and as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe,1,1,0.9774332840183855
she was extremely angry with herself if she could not have been angry with frank churchill too it would have been dreadful -- as for jane fairfax she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account harriet would be anxiety enough she need no longer be unhappy about jane whose troubles and whose ill-health having of course the same origin must be equally under cure -- her days of insignificance and evil were over -- she would soon be well and happy and prosperous -- emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted this discovery laid many smaller matters open no doubt it had been from jealousy -- in jane's eyes she had been a rival and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison she understood it all and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings she acknowledged that jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge there was little sympathy to be spared for any body else emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first considering the very superior claims of the object it ought and judging by its apparently stronger effect on harriet's mind producing reserve and self-command it would -- she must communicate the painful truth however and as soon as possible an injunction of secresy had been among mr weston's parting words for the present the whole affair was to be completely a secret mr churchill had made a point of it as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum -- emma had promised but still harriet must be excepted it was her superior duty,1,1,0.9997240181762789
about jane fairfax did you ever hear any thing so strange oh -- you need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr weston has told me himself i met him just now he told me it was to be a great secret and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you but he said you knew it,1,1,0.9229901575794242
i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject replied emma smiling but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him,1,1,0.7995562781073189
to be sure i am i never could have an idea of any body else -- and so i thought you knew when we talked about him it was as clear as possible,1,1,0.8234693304611043
not quite returned emma with forced calmness for all that you then said appeared to me to relate to a different person i could almost assert that you had named mr frank churchill i am sure the service mr frank churchill had rendered you in protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of,1,1,0.9771055199225122
harriet was standing at one of the windows emma turned round to look at her in consternation and hastily said,1,1,0.7011527105345109
her own conduct as well as her own heart was before her in the same few minutes she saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before how improperly had she been acting by harriet how inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational how unfeeling had been her conduct what blindness what madness had led her on it struck her with dreadful force and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world some portion of respect for herself however in spite of all these demerits -- some concern for her own appearance and a strong sense of justice by harriet -- there would be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by mr knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness with even apparent kindness -- for her own advantage indeed it was fit that the utmost extent of harriet's hopes should be enquired into and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person whose counsels had never led her right -- rousing from reflection therefore and subduing her emotion she turned to harriet again and in a more inviting accent renewed the conversation for as to the subject which had first introduced it the wonderful story of jane fairfax that was quite sunk and lost -- neither of them thought but of mr knightley and themselves,1,1,0.9986604287029132
oh had she never brought harriet forward had she left her where she ought and where he had told her she ought -- had she not with a folly which no tongue could express prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong -- all would have been safe none of this dreadful sequel would have been,1,1,0.9626256531611681
on your side my love it was very innocently done but she probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in she said was that of making her unreasonable the consciousness of having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been -- that had been -- hard for him to bear i did not make the allowances ' said she which i ought to have done for his temper and spirits -- his delightful spirits and that gaiety that playfulness of disposition which under any other circumstances would i am sure have been as constantly bewitching to me as they were at first ' she then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity to thank you -- i could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself,1,1,0.9955066559646097
mrs weston's communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection by increasing her esteem and compassion and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax she bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been in some measure the cause had she followed mr knightley's known wishes in paying that attention to miss fairfax which was every way her due had she tried to know her better had she done her part towards intimacy had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith she must in all probability have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now -- birth abilities and education had been equally marking one as an associate for her to be received with gratitude and the other -- what was she -- supposing even that they had never become intimate friends that she had never been admitted into miss fairfax's confidence on this important matter -- which was most probable -- still in knowing her as she ought and as she might she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to mr dixon which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself but had so unpardonably imparted an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of jane's feelings by the levity or carelessness of frank churchill's of all the sources of evil surrounding the former since her coming to highbury she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst she must have been a perpetual enemy they never could have been all three together without her having stabbed jane fairfax's peace in a thousand instances and on box hill perhaps it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more,1,1,0.9996985845759799
the weather continued much the same all the following morning and the same loneliness and the same melancholy seemed to reign at hartfield -- but in the afternoon it cleared the wind changed into a softer quarter the clouds were carried off the sun appeared it was summer again with all the eagerness which such a transition gives emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible never had the exquisite sight smell sensation of nature tranquil warm and brilliant after a storm been more attractive to her she longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce and on mr perry's coming in soon after dinner with a disengaged hour to give her father she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery -- there with spirits freshened and thoughts a little relieved she had taken a few turns when she saw mr knightley passing through the garden door and coming towards her -- it was the first intimation of his being returned from london she had been thinking of him the moment before as unquestionably sixteen miles distant -- there was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind she must be collected and calm in half a minute they were together the how d'ye do's were quiet and constrained on each side she asked after their mutual friends they were all well -- when had he left them -- only that morning he must have had a wet ride -- yes -- he meant to walk with her she found he had just looked into the dining-room and as he was not wanted there preferred being out of doors -- she thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully and the first possible cause for it suggested by her fears was that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother and was pained by the manner in which they had been received,1,1,0.9623689320416168
have i said he quietly and looking at her of what nature,1,0,0.31849868815709126
if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill i have heard that already,1,1,0.9786563083224348
you probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have had your suspicions -- i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution -- i wish i had attended to it -- but -- with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh i seem to have been doomed to blindness,1,1,0.8744796848501352
time my dearest emma time will heal the wound -- your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your father's sake -- i know you will not allow yourself -- her arm was pressed again as he added in a more broken and subdued accent the feelings of the warmest friendship -- indignation -- abominable scoundrel -- and in a louder steadier tone he concluded with he will soon be gone they will soon be in yorkshire i am sorry for her she deserves a better fate,1,1,0.9152269875334713
she had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible but he was silent and as far as she could judge deep in thought at last and tolerably in his usual tone he said,1,1,0.8608039615741534
emma could say no more they seemed to be within half a sentence of harriet and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject if possible she made her plan she would speak of something totally different -- the children in brunswick square and she only waited for breath to begin when mr knightley startled her by saying,1,1,0.9786372853394515
thank you said he in an accent of deep mortification and not another syllable followed,1,1,0.5369031826366276
emma could not bear to give him pain he was wishing to confide in her -- perhaps to consult her -- cost her what it would she would listen she might assist his resolution or reconcile him to it she might give just praise to harriet or by representing to him his own independence relieve him from that state of indecision which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his -- they had reached the house,1,1,0.979588182741564
what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house from what she had brought out -- she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering -- she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away,1,1,0.9607490439659818
they sat down to tea -- the same party round the same table -- how often it had been collected -- and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun -- but never in such a state of spirits never in any thing like it and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house or even the attentive daughter,1,1,0.6994636874702479
to mrs weston windsor-july my dear madam,1,1,0.9375950212497253
but that would not do mr weston was to call in the evening and she must return it by him,1,1,0.9361801200187466
i would rather be talking to you he replied but as it seems a matter of justice it shall be done,1,1,0.5553068876529903
he trifles here said he as to the temptation he knows he is wrong and has nothing rational to urge -- bad -- he ought not to have formed the engagement -- his father's disposition ' -- he is unjust however to his father mr weston's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions but mr weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it -- very true he did not come till miss fairfax was here,1,1,0.9742073489804469
i was not quite impartial in my judgment emma -- but yet i think -- had you not been in the case -- i should still have distrusted him,1,1,0.8695164270027083
after this he made some progress without any pause frank churchill's confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing,1,1,0.8830994482682344
emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party and grew uncomfortable her own behaviour had been so very improper she was deeply ashamed and a little afraid of his next look it was all read however steadily attentively and without the smallest remark and excepting one momentary glance at her instantly withdrawn in the fear of giving pain -- no remembrance of box hill seemed to exist,1,1,0.9291533559753291
there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the eltons was his next observation -- his feelings are natural -- what actually resolve to break with him entirely -- she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each -- she dissolved it -- what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour -- well he must be a most extraordinary --,1,1,0.9632535565004855
you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am but still you must at least i hope you must think the better of him for it i hope it does him some service with you,1,1,0.8439387032394496
she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which harriet had occupied there was a communication before her one which she only could be competent to make -- the confession of her engagement to her father but she would have nothing to do with it at present -- she had resolved to defer the disclosure till mrs weston were safe and well no additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved -- and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time -- a fortnight at least of leisure and peace of mind to crown every warmer but more agitating delight should be hers,1,1,0.9938351504018001
she went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door but had not been into the house since the morning after box hill when poor jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected -- the fear of being still unwelcome determined her though assured of their being at home to wait in the passage and send up her name -- she heard patty announcing it but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss bates had before made so happily intelligible -- no she heard nothing but the instant reply of beg her to walk up -- and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself coming eagerly forward as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient -- emma had never seen her look so well so lovely so engaging there was consciousness animation and warmth there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted -- she came forward with an offered hand and said in a low but very feeling tone,1,1,0.9948850354873737
emma was gratified and would soon have shewn no want of words if the sound of mrs elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checked her and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very very earnest shake of the hand,1,1,0.944264683316749
for when a lady's in the case you know all other things give place,1,0,0.4168161749236774
emma could not doubt it was a palpable display repeated on every possible occasion when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs weston she found herself abruptly addressed with,1,1,0.9574881760988745
thank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindness -- it is impossible to say -- yes indeed i quite understand -- dearest jane's prospects -- that is i do not mean -- but she is charmingly recovered -- how is mr woodhouse -- i am so glad -- quite out of my power -- such a happy little circle as you find us here -- yes indeed -- charming young man -- that is -- so very friendly i mean good mr perry -- such attention to jane -- and from her great her more than commonly thankful delight towards mrs elton for being there emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane from the vicarage quarter which was now graciously overcome -- after a few whispers indeed which placed it beyond a guess mrs elton speaking louder said,1,1,0.9982838401122397
yes here i am my good friend and here i have been so long that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise but the truth is that i am waiting for my lord and master he promised to join me here and pay his respects to you,1,1,0.5171340547381571
it seemed an unnecessary caution jane was wanting to give her words not to mrs elton but to miss woodhouse as the latter plainly saw the wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted was very evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look,1,1,0.9897456503345593
mr elton made his appearance his lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity,1,1,0.8137646522017344
very pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come -- but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared -- here have i been sitting this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience -- for who can say you know how soon it may be wanted,1,1,0.6744491187052822
no no that's to-morrow and i particularly wanted to see knightley to-day on that very account -- such a dreadful broiling morning -- i went over the fields too -- speaking in a tone of great ill-usage which made it so much the worse and then not to find him at home i assure you i am not at all pleased and no apology left no message for me the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected -- very extraordinary -- and nobody knew at all which way he was gone perhaps to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods -- miss woodhouse this is not like our friend knightley -- can you explain it,1,1,0.9789466202517829
emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly in all probability she was at this very time waited for there and mr knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards mr elton if not towards william larkins,1,1,0.9793978013773453
it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility had you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct -- i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent,1,1,0.901938657275949
you are very right it has been thought of and i will own to you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with mr churchill at enscombe it is settled there must be three months at least of deep mourning but when they are over i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for,1,1,0.9146848467876162
she has had the advantage you know of practising on me she continued -- like la baronne d'almane on la comtesse d'ostalis in madame de genlis' adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan,1,0,0.33736195203940755
nothing very bad -- the fate of thousands she will be disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older i am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma i who am owing all my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them,1,1,0.8432544711658341
do you -- i have no doubt nature gave you understanding -- miss taylor gave you principles you must have done well my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good it was very natural for you to say what right has he to lecture me -- and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner i do not believe i did you any good the good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me i could not think about you so much without doating on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least,1,1,0.9443261737430821
impossible -- i never can call you any thing but mr knightley ' i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs elton by calling you mr k -- but i will promise she added presently laughing and blushing -- i will promise to call you once by your christian name i do not say when but perhaps you may guess where -- in the building in which n takes m for better for worse,1,1,0.9023122217885635
isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits which appeared perfectly natural as there was a dentist to be consulted but since that business had been over she did not appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before -- isabella to be sure was no very quick observer yet if harriet had not been equal to playing with the children it would not have escaped her emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on by harriet's being to stay longer her fortnight was likely to be a month at least mr and mrs john knightley were to come down in august and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back,1,1,0.9983684175708113
john enters like a brother into my happiness continued mr knightley but he is no complimenter and though i well know him to have likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from making flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes,1,1,0.9507080678892753
he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two interrupted she with a sort of serious smile -- much less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject,1,1,0.7136438116234513
the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread and mr weston had his five minutes share of it but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind -- he saw the advantages of the match and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife but the wonder of it was very soon nothing and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it,1,1,0.9534803810036674
it is to be a secret i conclude said he these matters are always a secret till it is found out that every body knows them only let me be told when i may speak out -- i wonder whether jane has any suspicion,1,1,0.6610575754980051
in general it was a very well approved match some might think him and others might think her the most in luck one set might recommend their all removing to donwell and leaving hartfield for the john knightleys and another might predict disagreements among their servants but yet upon the whole there was no serious objection raised except in one habitation the vicarage -- there the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction mr elton cared little about it compared with his wife he only hoped the young lady's pride would now be contented and supposed she had always meant to catch knightley if she could and on the point of living at hartfield could daringly exclaim rather he than i -- but mrs elton was very much discomposed indeed -- poor knightley poor fellow -- sad business for him -- she was extremely concerned for though very eccentric he had a thousand good qualities -- how could he be so taken in -- did not think him at all in love -- not in the least -- poor knightley -- there would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him -- how happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him but that would be all over now -- poor fellow -- no more exploring parties to donwell made for her oh no there would be a mrs knightley to throw cold water on every thing -- extremely disagreeable but she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day -- shocking plan living together it would never do she knew a family near maple grove who had tried it and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter,1,1,0.9990243809887899
have you heard from her yourself this morning cried he you have i believe and know the whole,1,1,0.593141272323833
you are prepared for the worst i see -- and very bad it is harriet smith marries robert martin,1,1,0.9625522583135203
it is so indeed continued mr knightley i have it from robert martin himself he left me not half an hour ago,1,1,0.9636609620333347
you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before,1,1,0.6983985760553973
her father's business was to announce james's being gone out to put the horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls and she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing,1,1,0.7715709526213188
serious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her resolutions and yet there was no preventing a laugh sometimes in the very midst of them she must laugh at such a close such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back such a heart -- such a harriet,1,1,0.8558749467636422
now there would be pleasure in her returning -- every thing would be a pleasure it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin,1,1,0.9408925024671179
they arrived -- mrs weston was alone in the drawing-room -- but hardly had they been told of the baby and mr woodhouse received the thanks for coming which he asked for when a glimpse was caught through the blind of two figures passing near the window,1,1,0.8437557166738779
it is frank and miss fairfax said mrs weston i was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning he stays till to-morrow and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us -- they are coming in i hope,1,1,0.9929011369918076
no indeed cried emma most happy to begin not in the least i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you -- and to give you joy in person,1,1,0.8340751437550585
i can never think of it she cried without extreme shame,1,1,0.5676442632401265
i have some hope resumed he of my uncle's being persuaded to pay a visit at randalls he wants to be introduced to her when the campbells are returned we shall meet them in london and continue there i trust till we may carry her northward -- but now i am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard miss woodhouse -- till this morning we have not once met since the day of reconciliation do not you pity me,1,1,0.9675195463665085
oh no no no -- how can you suspect me of such a thing i was the most miserable wretch,1,1,0.6679571669379104
if not in our dispositions she presently added with a look of true sensibility there is a likeness in our destiny the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own,1,1,0.5866841419631516
jane was forced to smile completely for a moment and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious low yet steady voice,1,1,0.5791775196457505
how you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me -- they will sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them,1,1,0.5490374684731477
the wedding was very much like other weddings where the parties have no taste for finery or parade and mrs elton from the particulars detailed by her husband thought it all extremely shabby and very inferior to her own -- very little white satin very few lace veils a most pitiful business -- selina would stare when she heard of it -- but in spite of these deficiencies the wishes the hopes the confidence the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union,1,1,0.9365907002051005
sir walter elliot of kellynch hall in somersetshire was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetage there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century and there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with an interest which never failed this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened,1,1,0.8919912753710417
such were elizabeth elliot's sentiments and sensations such the cares to alloy the agitations to vary the sameness and the elegance the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life such the feelings to give interest to a long uneventful residence in one country circle to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad no talents or accomplishments for home to occupy,1,1,0.9410693663297598
how anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence lady russell's had no success at all could not be put up with were not to be borne what every comfort of life knocked off journeys london servants horses table -- contractions and restrictions every where to live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman no he would sooner quit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms,1,1,0.9224165107830822
there had been three alternatives london bath or another house in the country all anne's wishes had been for the latter a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady russell's society still be near mary and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object of her ambition but the usual fate of anne attended her in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on she disliked bath and did not think it agreed with her and bath was to be her home,1,1,0.9930667225251446
the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part and a very material part of the scheme which had been happily engrafted on the beginning he was not only to quit his home but to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude which stronger heads than sir walter's have found too much kellynch hall was to be let this however was a profound secret not to be breathed beyond their own circle,1,1,0.921097391259496
he would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter that's all i have to remark a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken ever so many before hey shepherd,1,1,0.8497506621888313
in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him,1,1,0.949570480374677
very true very true what miss anne says is very true was mr shepherd's rejoinder and oh certainly was his daughter's but sir walter's remark was soon afterwards --,1,1,0.9459780872259568
he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years,1,0,0.3619982657194485
bless me how very odd i shall forget my own name soon i suppose a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmer's man breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement submitted to an amicable compromise very odd indeed,1,1,0.5491893797800076
he was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkford however suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworth his brother who being made commander in consequence of the action off st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire in the summer of 1806 and having no parent living found a home for half a year at monkford he was at that time a remarkably fine young man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy and anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste and feeling half the sum of attraction on either side might have been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and deeply in love it would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest she in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in having them accepted,1,1,0.9929352062989115
on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft's seeing kellynch hall anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell's and keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them,1,1,0.9787699634198435
lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks she was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare of bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country did not think that everything considered she wished to remain it would be most right and most wise and therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others,1,1,0.996557549418866
she spoke and seemed only to offend elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly answered for each party's perfectly knowing their situation,1,1,0.9119370703260952
uppercross was a moderate-sized village which a few years back had been completely in the old english style containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers the mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees substantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonage enclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a pear-tree trained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young 'squire it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage for his residence and uppercross cottage with its veranda french windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch the traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on,1,1,0.5969109723489598
so you are come at last i began to think i should never see you i am so ill i can hardly speak i have not seen a creature the whole morning,1,1,0.725300924691798
anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband oh charles is out shooting i have not seen him since seven o'clock he would go though i told him how ill i was he said he should not stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one i assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning,1,1,0.8711223464378323
yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good little charles does not mind a word i say and walter is growing quite as bad,1,1,0.8063184888032363
well you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfully you know i always cure you when i come how are your neighbours at the great house,1,1,0.8276420353256871
i never want them i assure you they talk and laugh a great deal too much for me oh anne i am so very unwell it was quite unkind of you not to come on thursday,1,1,0.8767153011475648
a great many things i assure you more than i can recollect in a moment but i can tell you some i have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father's books and pictures i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth's plants are for lady russell i have had all my own little concerns to arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish as a sort of take-leave i was told that they wished it but all these things took up a great deal of time,1,1,0.8856868883253676
i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party,1,1,0.897270917376925
anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that though there were on each side continual subjects of offence neither family could now do without it to the great house accordingly they went to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour with a small carpet and shining floor to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp flower-stands and little tables placed in every direction oh could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness the portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment,1,1,0.7030922960366737
she had no dread of these two months mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort she was always on friendly terms with her brother-in-law and in the children who loved her nearly as well and respected her a great deal more than their mother she had an object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion,1,1,0.9552788987647352
again it was mary's complaint that mrs musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due when they dined at the great house with other families and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place and one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves one of them after talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said i have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are about their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it it is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world but i know it is taken notice of by many persons,1,1,0.9831614353822478
the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company the neighbourhood was not large but the musgroves were visited by everybody and had more dinner-parties and more callers more visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family there were more completely popular,1,1,0.9407442995114527
the girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionally in an unpremeditated little ball there was a family of cousins within a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumstances who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures they would come at any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and anne very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post played country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove more than anything else and often drew this compliment -- well done miss anne very well done indeed lord bless me how those little fingers of yours fly about,1,1,0.9689597642326948
so passed the first three weeks michaelmas came and now anne's heart must be in kellynch again a beloved home made over to others all the precious rooms and furniture groves and prospects beginning to own other eyes and other limbs she could not think of much else on the 29th of september and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from mary who on having occasion to note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me is not this the day the crofts were to come to kellynch i am glad i did not think of it before how low it makes me,1,1,0.9378213209775952
he was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets c to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herself as well as she could that the same brother must still be in question she could not however reach such a degree of certainty as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the crofts had previously been calling,1,1,0.9277040547943946
the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome hopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved seldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross two years before,1,1,0.9157546805390089
he had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board captain frederick wentworth's frigate the laconia and from the laconia he had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters all the rest had been mere applications for money,1,1,0.934227056258003
i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sick-room than charles for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin kicking about i have not nerves for the sort of thing,1,1,0.846997045737395
i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home than you are if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him it is anne's own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday,1,1,0.9564296016980076
anne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction was at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening when the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable and this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits they were gone she hoped to be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem as for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort as were perhaps ever likely to be hers she knew herself to be of the first utility to the child and what was it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself agreeable to others,1,1,0.9882873329824742
her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance and their visit in general there had been music singing talking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners in captain wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all to know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with charles he was to come to breakfast but not at the cottage though that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed to come to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of being in mrs charles musgrove's way on account of the child and therefore somehow they hardly knew how it ended in charles's being to meet him to breakfast at his father's,1,1,0.9930978731388416
it is over it is over she repeated to herself again and again in nervous gratitude the worst is over,1,1,0.6151861001920799
soon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less eight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness what might not eight years do events of every description changes alienations removals -- all all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past -- how natural how certain too it included nearly a third part of her own life,1,1,0.8301292359905795
alas with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing,1,1,0.7371867377177448
altered beyond his knowledge anne fully submitted in silent deep mortification doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge for he was not altered or not for the worse she had already acknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently let him think of her as he would no the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly open look in no respect lessening his personal advantages she had seen the same frederick wentworth,1,1,0.9561522705380248
so altered that he should not have known her again these were words which could not but dwell with her yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them they were of sobering tendency they allayed agitation they composed and consequently must make her happier,1,1,0.8807876009857888
ah miss anne if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son i dare say he would have been just such another by this time,1,1,0.930372729679365
anne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while mrs musgrove relieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes therefore could not keep pace with the conversation of the others,1,1,0.9364841156464907
you will not find her there quite worn out and broken up i was the last man who commanded her hardly fit for service then reported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent off to the west indies,1,0,0.4376094365379574
poor dear fellow continued mrs musgrove he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you,1,1,0.9672163529667915
they were actually on the same sofa for mrs musgrove had most readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs musgrove it was no insignificant barrier indeed mrs musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment and while the agitations of anne's slender form and pensive face may be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son whom alive nobody had cared for,1,1,0.9867849702409904
personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful set of limbs in the world but fair or not fair there are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain -- which taste cannot tolerate -- which ridicule will seize,1,1,0.5765706276229955
should i i am glad i was not a week later then,1,1,0.6947336760060542
depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable,1,1,0.8659215412667546
my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth,1,1,0.9600573322395443
pretty well ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more i have crossed the atlantic four times and have been once to the east indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home cork and lisbon and gibraltar but i never went beyond the streights and never was in the west indies we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies,1,1,0.5616077671086229
i beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced to sit down again,1,1,0.6442818358527065
it was soon uppercross with him almost every day the musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly in the morning when he had no companion at home for the admiral and mrs croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves in their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig lately added to their establishment,1,1,0.9233347368767858
hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth among the musgroves and their dependencies it was unvarying warm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more than established when a certain charles hayter returned among them to be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wentworth very much in the way,1,1,0.9870356890492609
the two families had always been on excellent terms there being no pride on one side and no envy on the other and only such a consciousness of superiority in the miss musgroves as made them pleased to improve their cousins charles's attentions to henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation it would not be a great match for her but if henrietta liked him -- and henrietta did seem to like him,1,1,0.993121645768708
her husband however would not agree with her here for besides having a regard for his cousin charles hayter was an eldest son and he saw things as an eldest son himself,1,1,0.9565857504668746
charles may say what he pleases cried mary to anne as soon as he was out of the room but it would be shocking to have henrietta marry charles hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse for me and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt that he has she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday i wish you had been there to see her behaviour and as to captain wentworth's liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense to say so for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best but charles is so positive i wish you had been with us yesterday for then you might have decided between us and i am sure you would have thought as i did unless you had been determined to give it against me,1,1,0.9980117468188875
he continued at the window and after calmly and politely saying i hope the little boy is better was silent,1,0,0.38597988205363176
walter cried charles hayter why do you not do as you are bid do not you hear your aunt speak come to me walter come to cousin charles,1,1,0.9101860970791538
anne's object was not to be in the way of anybody and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary to keep with her brother and sister her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness that season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being read some attempt at description or some lines of feeling she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations but it was not possible that when within reach of captain wentworth's conversation with either of the miss musgroves she should not try to hear it yet she caught little very remarkable it was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing might fall into he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister this distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech of louisa's which struck her after one of the many praises of the day which were continually bursting forth captain wentworth added --,1,1,0.976753135545434
had you cried he catching the same tone i honour you and there was silence between them for a little while,1,0,0.39350529688785235
anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again the sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnet fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining happiness and the images of youth and hope and spring all gone together blessed her memory she roused herself to say as they struck by order into another path is not this one of the ways to winthrop but nobody heard or at least nobody answered her,1,1,0.7841834810143526
winthrop however or its environs -- for young men are sometimes to be met with strolling about near home -- was their destination and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures where the ploughs at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence and meaning to have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill which parted uppercross and winthrop and soon commanded a full view of the latter at the foot of the hill on the other side,1,1,0.5818163273029503
and so i made her go i could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense what would i be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right by the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded when i have made up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at winthrop to-day and yet she was as near giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance,1,1,0.9430198060942302
the sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no more her own emotions still kept her fixed she had much to recover from before she could move the listener's proverbial fate was not absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard a great deal of very painful import she saw how her own character was considered by captain wentworth and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation,1,1,0.9866700531764795
these points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from uppercross where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough her usefulness to little charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months' visit there but he was gaining strength apace and she had nothing else to stay for,1,1,0.9786398041650155
the conclusion of her visit however was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined captain wentworth after being unseen and unheard of at uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away,1,1,0.956046406604068
a letter from his friend captain harville having found him out at last had brought intelligence of captain harville's being settled with his family at lyme for the winter of their being therefore quite unknowingly within twenty miles of each other captain harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before and captain wentworth's anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to lyme he had been there for four-and-twenty hours his acquittal was complete his friendship warmly honoured a lively interest excited for his friend and his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to by the party that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves and a project for going thither was the consequence,1,1,0.9946026438242874
after securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the inns the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea they were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which lyme as a public place might offer the rooms were shut up the lodgers almost all gone scarcely any family but of the residents left and as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves the remarkable situation of the town the principal street almost hurrying into the water the walk to the cobb skirting round the pleasant little bay which in the season is animated with bathing machines and company the cobb itself its old wonders and new improvements with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town are what the stranger's eye will seek and a very strange stranger it must be who does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme to make him wish to know it better the scenes in its neighbourhood charmouth with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country and still more its sweet retired bay backed by dark cliffs where fragments of low rock among the sands make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide for sitting in unwearied contemplation the woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme and above all pinny with its green chasms between romantic rocks where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed isle of wight these places must be visited and visited again to make the worth of lyme understood,1,0,0.476175484619825
captain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in manners was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging mrs harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however to have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own because the friends of captain wentworth or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them the dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly accepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth should have brought any such party to lyme without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them,1,1,0.9955122720526036
they went back to dress and dine and so well had the scheme answered already that nothing was found amiss though its being so entirely out of season and the no thoroughfare of lyme and the no expectation of company had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn,1,1,0.7701201294300275
his looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion to his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requested to particularize mentioned such works of our best moralists such collections of the finest letters such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances,1,1,0.8667871271360829
anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good of a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man as a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate's being married,1,1,0.9653682958638021
of course said mary you will mention our seeing mr elliot the next time you write to bath i think my father certainly ought to hear of it do mention all about him,1,1,0.9533063815043524
no said anne that i can easily believe to be impossible but in time perhaps -- we know what time does in every case of affliction and you must remember captain harville that your friend may yet be called a young mourner -- only last summer i understand,1,1,0.8973116667159253
anne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed able to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject and when he spoke again it was of something totally different,1,1,0.8783526359860399
every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea and in a moment it was all done in rapid moments captain benwick had resigned the poor corpse-like figure entirely to the brother's care and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity,1,1,0.8450737940786751
they were not off the cobb before the harvilles met them captain benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance which showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately informed and directed as they passed towards the spot shocked as captain harville was he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done she must be taken to their house all must go to their house and await the surgeon's arrival there they would not listen to scruples he was obeyed they were all beneath his roof and while louisa under mrs harville's direction was conveyed up stairs and given possession of her own bed assistance cordials restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them,1,1,0.9740874416593618
then it is settled musgrove cried captain wentworth that you stay and that i take care of your sister home but as to the rest as to the others if one stays to assist mrs harville i think it need be only one mrs charles musgrove will of course wish to get back to her children but if anne will stay no one so proper so capable as anne,1,1,0.9936224871939305
anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill-judging claims of mary but so it must be and they set off for the town charles taking care of his sister and captain benwick attending to her she gave a moment's recollection as they hurried along to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning there she had listened to henrietta's schemes for dr shirley's leaving uppercross farther on she had first seen mr elliot a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfare,1,1,0.9962214529962307
in the mean while she was in the carriage he had handed them both in and placed himself between them and in this manner under these circumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anne she quitted lyme how the long stage would pass how it was to affect their manners what was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee it was all quite natural however he was devoted to henrietta always turning towards her and when he spoke at all always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits in general his voice and manner were studiously calm to spare henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle once only when she had been grieving over the last ill-judged ill-fated walk to the cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of he burst forth as if wholly overcome --,1,1,0.978251687878373
there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject they must speak of the accident at lyme lady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before when a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it must be talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence lament the result and captain wentworth's name must be mentioned by both anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell she could not speak the name and look straight forward to lady russell's eye till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa when this was told his name distressed her no longer,1,1,0.9936306093931927
i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it,1,1,0.7767734725089865
as to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to work on ascertained events and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence that its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to think how long miss musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming --,1,1,0.931619728797152
ay a very bad business indeed a new sort of way this for a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistress's head is not it miss elliot this is breaking a head and giving a plaster truly,1,1,0.6876033919946041
now this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from a little reverie to be coming and finding us here i had not recollected it before i declare but it must be very bad but now do not stand upon ceremony get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it,1,1,0.6160087280860017
though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after mr and mrs musgrove's going than anne conceived they could have been at all wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home again and as soon as possible after their return to uppercross they drove over to the lodge they had left louisa beginning to sit up but her head though clear was exceedingly weak and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home and her father and mother who must return in time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them,1,1,0.9954225642476202
anne enquired after captain benwick mary's face was clouded directly charles laughed,1,1,0.9737454201031804
charles laughed again and said now mary you know very well how it really was it was all your doing turning to anne he fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discovered that lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him and he had not courage to come that is the fact upon my honour mary knows it is,1,1,0.8815047516388356
immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the cottage expressly arrived to amuse them on one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk and gold paper and on the other were tressels and trays bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boys were holding high revel the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire which seemed determined to be heard in spite of all the noise of the others charles and mary also came in of course during their visit and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects to lady russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes talking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the children on his knees generally in vain it was a fine family-piece,1,1,0.8809571404317866
she was put down in camden place and lady russell then drove to her own lodgings in rivers street,1,1,0.8004838004739953
anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme but without being much attended to oh yes perhaps it had been mr elliot they did not know it might be him perhaps they could not listen to her description of him they were describing him themselves sir walter especially he did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shaped face his sensible eye but at the same time must lament his being very much under-hung a defect which time seemed to have increased nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse mr elliot appeared to think that he sir walter was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted but sir walter had not been able to return the compliment entirely which had embarrassed him he did not mean to complain however mr elliot was better to look at than most men and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere,1,1,0.9896794452786695
anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown or a cap would not be liable to any such misuse when a knock at the door suspended everything a knock at the door and so late it was ten o'clock could it be mr elliot they knew he was to dine in lansdown crescent it was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did they could think of no one else mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot's knock mrs clay was right with all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give mr elliot was ushered into the room,1,1,0.9278234934149557
it was the same the very same man with no difference but of dress anne drew a little back while the others received his compliments and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour but he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before c c which was all as politely done and as politely taken as possible but her part must follow then sir walter talked of his youngest daughter mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter there was no occasion for remembering mary and anne smiling and blushing very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten and instantly saw with amusement at his little start of surprise that he had not been at all aware of who she was he looked completely astonished but not more astonished than pleased his eyes brightened and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship alluded to the past and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already he was quite as good-looking as he had appeared at lyme his countenance improved by speaking and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be so polished so easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare them in excellence to only one person's manners they were not the same but they were perhaps equally good,1,1,0.9970927890207808
he sat down with them and improved their conversation very much there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man ten minutes were enough to certify that his tone his expressions his choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all the operation of a sensible discerning mind as soon as he could he began to talk to her of lyme wanting to compare opinions respecting the place but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time to give his own route understand something of hers and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her she gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme his regret increased as he listened he had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs had heard voices mirth continually thought they must be a most delightful set of people longed to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself if he had but asked who the party were the name of musgrove would have told him enough well it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn which he had adopted when quite a young man on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious,1,1,0.97901362930168
the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said he as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing are more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings in the world the folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view,1,1,0.6727174000973812
but he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone he knew it he was soon diffused again among the others and it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme,1,1,0.8717719768163447
he staid an hour with them the elegant little clock on the mantel- piece had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale before mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long,1,1,0.5764943354249333
it was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently and it did not surprise her therefore that lady russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing to require more motives than appeared in mr elliot's great desire of a reconciliation in lady russell's view it was perfectly natural that mr elliot at a mature time of life should feel it a most desirable object and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people to be on good terms with the head of his family the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only erring in the heyday of youth anne presumed however still to smile about it and at last to mention elizabeth lady russell listened and looked and made only this cautious reply -- elizabeth very well time will explain,1,1,0.9928564173420712
anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility and she must acknowledge herself disappointed she had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen a wish that they had more pride for our cousins lady dalrymple and miss carteret our cousins the dalrymples sounded in her ears all day long,1,1,0.9615876382378428
you are mistaken said he gently that is not good company that is the best good company requires only birth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary it will do very well my cousin anne shakes her head she is not satisfied she is fastidious my dear cousin sitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know but will it answer will it make you happy will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible you may depend upon it that they will move in the first set in bath this winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for,1,1,0.9654277645898738
pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might be as you say but in bath sir walter elliot and his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance,1,1,0.9837284549908757
he looked as he spoke to the seat which mrs clay had been lately occupying a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant and though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride she was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father's getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her,1,1,0.9885406966023257
westgate buildings said he and who is miss anne elliot to be visiting in westgate buildings a mrs smith a widow mrs smith and who was her husband one of five thousand mr smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere and what is her attraction that she is old and sickly upon my word miss anne elliot you have the most extraordinary taste everything that revolts other people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations are inviting to you but surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow she is not so near her end i presume but that she may hope to see another day what is her age forty,1,1,0.9773416041935152
westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement observed sir walter sir henry russell's widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty a mere mrs smith an every-day mrs smith of all people and all names in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of england and ireland mrs smith such a name,1,1,0.9968691350258302
mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects i think highly of him said anne but we should not suit,1,1,0.9776140896761706
mr elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open there was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delight at the evil or good of others this to anne was a decided imperfection her early impressions were incurable she prized the frank the open-hearted the eager character beyond all others warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still she felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind never varied whose tongue never slipped,1,1,0.9453713580755696
it was the beginning of february and anne having been a month in bath was growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme she wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated it was three weeks since she had heard at all she only knew that henrietta was at home again and that louisa though considered to be recovering fast was still in lyme and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening when a thicker letter than usual from mary was delivered to her and to quicken the pleasure and surprise with admiral and mrs croft's compliments,1,1,0.9979911312974751
oh those letters are convenient passports they secure an introduction i should have visited admiral croft however at any rate i know what is due to my tenant,1,1,0.9115829816416915
i kept my letter open that i might send you word how louisa bore her journey and now i am extremely glad i did having a great deal to add in the first place i had a note from mrs croft yesterday offering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeed addressed to me just as it ought i shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as i like the admiral does not seem very ill and i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants i shall be truly glad to have them back again our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family but now for louisa i have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little she and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely and in the evening we went to ask her how she did when we were rather surprised not to find captain benwick of the party for he had been invited as well as the harvilles and what do you think was the reason neither more nor less than his being in love with louisa and not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer from mr musgrove for it was all settled between him and her before she came away and he had written to her father by captain harville true upon my honour are not you astonished i shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it for i never did mrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter we are all very well pleased however for though it is not equal to her marrying captain wentworth it is infinitely better than charles hayter and mr musgrove has written his consent and captain benwick is expected to-day mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister's account but however louisa is a great favourite with both indeed mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her charles wonders what captain wentworth will say but if you remember i never thought him attached to louisa i never could see anything of it and this is the end you see of captain benwick's being supposed to be an admirer of yours how charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me i hope he will be more agreeable now certainly not a great match for louisa musgrove but a million times better than marrying among the hayters,1,1,0.9996650931596874
she longed to see the crofts but when the meeting took place it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them the visit of ceremony was paid and returned and louisa musgrove was mentioned and captain benwick too without even half a smile,1,1,0.9841425640062397
ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name i wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names i should never be out if they were all sophys or something of that sort well this miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick he was courting her week after week the only wonder was what they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right but even then there was something odd in their way of going on instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth and then he went off to see edward when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edward's and there he has been ever since we have seen nothing of him since november even sophy could not understand it but now the matter has take the strangest turn of all for this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being to marry frederick is to marry james benwick you know james benwick,1,1,0.9867485177952529
anne was caught she had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other not at all to represent captain benwick's manners as the very best that could possibly be and after a little hesitation she was beginning to say i was not entering into any comparison of the two friends but the admiral interrupted her with --,1,1,0.9603230933038782
no no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has too much spirit for that if the girl likes another man better it is very fit she should have him,1,1,0.6363163440203257
anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant to convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther she therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet attention and the admiral had it all his own way,1,1,0.9075675169158698
it did not surprise but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth would not know him she saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth saw him that there was complete internal recognition on each side she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance expecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness,1,1,0.978701892288327
as soon as they were out of sight the ladies of captain wentworth's party began talking of them,1,1,0.9190584002022649
oh no that is clear enough one can guess what will happen there he is always with them half lives in the family i believe what a very good-looking man,1,0,0.40879297377928075
anne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdain either at her friend or herself the part which provoked her most was that in all this waste of foresight and caution she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them,1,1,0.900831210979622
i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme i am afraid you must have suffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you at the time,1,1,0.7681368350790735
anne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room her happiness was from within her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed but she knew nothing about it she was thinking only of the last half hour and as they passed to their seats her mind took a hasty range over it his choice of subjects his expressions and still more his manner and look had been such as she could see in only one light his opinion of louisa musgrove's inferiority an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give his wonder at captain benwick his feelings as to a first strong attachment sentences begun which he could not finish his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidance were no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship and regard but by the tenderness of the past yes some share of the tenderness of the past she could not contemplate the change as implying less he must love her,1,1,0.9834468152369432
i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long replied he without knowing something of miss anne elliot and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman,1,1,0.9830345775079151
mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery to have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless people is irresistible and anne was all curiosity she wondered and questioned him eagerly but in vain he delighted in being asked but he would not tell,1,1,0.9707110695520669
no no some time or other perhaps but not now he would mention no names now but such he could assure her had been the fact he had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited the warmest curiosity to know her,1,1,0.981086143279893
the name of anne elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to me very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i dared i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change,1,1,0.8518563945897955
such she believed were his words but scarcely had she received their sound than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivial her father and lady dalrymple were speaking,1,1,0.949521211139272
the first act was over now she hoped for some beneficial change and after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party some of them did decide on going in quest of tea anne was one of the few who did not choose to move she remained in her seat and so did lady russell but she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot and she did not mean whatever she might feel on lady russell's account to shrink from conversation with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportunity she was persuaded by lady russell's countenance that she had seen him,1,1,0.992457785850912
in re-settling themselves there were now many changes the result of which was favourable for her colonel wallis declined sitting down again and mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret in a manner not to be refused to sit between them and by some other removals and a little scheming of her own anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before much more within reach of a passer-by she could not do so without comparing herself with miss larolles the inimitable miss larolles but still she did it and not with much happier effect though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed,1,1,0.982269699946211
no he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for and he was gone directly,1,1,0.8125353596055751
she felt a great deal of good-will towards him in spite of the mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard perhaps compassion she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which he seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation by his own sentiments by his early prepossession it was altogether very extraordinary flattering but painful there was much to regret how she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case was not worth enquiry for there was a captain wentworth and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad her affection would be his for ever their union she believed could not divide her more from other men than their final separation,1,1,0.9965883305615619
the ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them,1,0,0.38044311676616605
but i ought to have looked about me more said anne conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about that the object only had been deficient,1,1,0.8145013015359694
pray said mrs smith is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me does he know that i am in bath,1,1,0.9893710138586913
i have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravely but it seems worn out now it is a great while since we met,1,1,0.9154753698965115
to confess the truth said mrs smith assuming her usual air of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have i want you to talk about me to mr elliot i want your interest with him he can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself of course it is done,1,1,0.9673381656364664
it first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago,1,1,0.9647206492635753
i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in her natural tone of cordiality i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you there were many things to be taken into the account one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot's real character though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary cold-blooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion oh he is black at heart hollow and black,1,1,0.9799581195610813
i know it all i know it all cried mrs smith he had been introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever i know he was invited and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage i knew all about it at the time i was privy to all the fors and againsts i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer any question you may wish to put,1,1,0.971182754447911
perhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot,1,1,0.9118034459089964
to be sure i did very often i used to boast of my own anne elliot and vouch for your being a very different creature from --,1,1,0.9595099410632604
indeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now,1,1,0.9158339905538391
anne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired the box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith sighing over it as she unlocked it said --,1,1,0.951937259407575
dear smith -- i have received yours your kindness almost overpowers me i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i have lived three-and-twenty years in the world and have seen none like it at present believe me i have no need of your services being in cash again give me joy i have got rid of sir walter and miss they are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them this summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer the baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again he is quite fool enough if he does however they will leave me in peace which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion he is worse than last year,1,1,0.8783407817506979
i wish i had any name but elliot i am sick of it the name of walter i can drop thank god and i desire you will never insult me with my second w again meaning for the rest of my life to be only yours truly -- wm elliot,1,1,0.6886346511182523
anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father she was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over and say --,1,1,0.9769532314942241
i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling,1,1,0.8079167662598143
my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do mr elliot's having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father that was all prior to my coming to bath i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived,1,1,0.9687420093636678
indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information in such a line facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another can hardly have much truth left,1,1,0.822322383420107
lessening i understand replied mrs smith he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis's understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it why to be sure ma'am ' said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else ' and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter's making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis's recommendation,1,1,0.9957049234314495
i am very glad to know all this said anne after a little thoughtfulness it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness,1,1,0.9250799858331987
but mr elliot was not done with mrs smith had been carried away from her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest of her own family concerns how much had been originally implied against him but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints and she listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her very deficient both in justice and compassion,1,1,0.9956219224152585
she learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by mr elliot's marriage they had been as before always together and mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender of throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance from his wife's account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong understanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him led by him and probably despised by him mr elliot raised by his marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's probable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths accordingly had been ruined,1,1,0.9982424415345007
anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her it was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity and anne felt at some moments that no flagrant open crime could have been worse she had a great deal to listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae of distress upon distress which in former conversations had been merely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend's usual state of mind,1,1,0.9872956983725731
after listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smith's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation she had seemed to recommend and praise him,1,1,0.9865482422464741
anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell and under such a supposition which would have been most miserable when time had disclosed all too late,1,1,0.987430071660325
anne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew such pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate the sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging placid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have done otherwise,1,1,0.9805527772582537
very well said elizabeth i have nothing to send but my love oh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me and pretend i have read it through i really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out lady russell quite bores one with her new publications you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night i used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her at the concert something so formal and arrange in her air and she sits so upright my best love of course,1,1,0.6134246352204297
while her father spoke there was a knock at the door who could it be anne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of mr elliot would have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off after the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard and mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered into the room,1,1,0.9864587635517521
i am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other -- that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both,1,1,0.9731592954641545
such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove exclaimed anne should be happy in their children's marriages they do everything to confer happiness i am sure what a blessing to young people to be in such hands your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery both in young and old i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now,1,1,0.9706428045979058
he answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recovered but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing or dancing it is quite different if one happens only to shut the door a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her all day long,1,0,0.351139970592022
here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles's following the others to admire mirrors and china but anne had heard enough to understand the present state of uppercross and rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it she would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want to lessen theirs,1,1,0.9601567602311639
mary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin began talking very warmly about the family features and protesting still more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anne to come and look for herself but anne did not mean to stir and tried to be cool and unconcerned her distress returned however on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves quite in the secret it was evident that the report concerning her had spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther,1,1,0.9799021474371166
but you must go charles it would be unpardonable to fail we were asked on purpose to be introduced there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with every attention is due to mr elliot consider my father's heir the future representative of the family,1,1,0.9845503367761904
captain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fire-place probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards and taking a station with less bare-faced design by anne,1,1,0.7934512156774691
you have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy the evening parties of the place,1,1,0.8362232623840938
only think of elizabeth's including everybody whispered mary very audibly i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted you see he cannot put the card out of his hand,1,1,0.8939147957718585
one day only had passed since anne's conversation with mrs smith but a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched by mr elliot's conduct except by its effects in one quarter that it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer her explanatory visit in rivers street she had promised to be with the musgroves from breakfast to dinner her faith was plighted and mr elliot's character like the sultaness scheherazade's head must live another day,1,1,0.9871677718594577
she could not keep her appointment punctually however the weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain on her friends' account and felt it very much on her own before she was able to attempt the walk when she reached the white hart and made her way to the proper apartment she found herself neither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrive the party before her were mrs musgrove talking to mrs croft and captain harville to captain wentworth and she immediately heard that mary and henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment it had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there till they returned she had only to submit sit down be outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed there was no delay no waste of time she was deep in the happiness of such misery or the misery of such happiness instantly two minutes after her entering the room captain wentworth said --,1,1,0.997381199363045
mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest daughter's engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet as captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again to talk it over what my brother hayter had said one day and what mr musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred to my sister hayter and what the young people had wished and what i said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well and a great deal in the same style of open-hearted communication minutiae which even with every advantage of taste and delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not give could be properly interesting only to the principals mrs croft was attending with great good-humour and whenever she spoke at all it was very sensibly anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self-occupied to hear,1,1,0.9993321521127756
and so ma'am all these thing considered said mrs musgrove in her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once and make the best of it as many others have done before them at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement,1,1,0.9713661642030484
have you finished your letter said captain harville,1,1,0.8955776846958334
perhaps i shall yes yes if you please no reference to examples in books men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands i will not allow books to prove anything,1,1,0.6419751807821986
you are a good soul cried captain harville putting his hand on her arm quite affectionately there is no quarrelling with you and when i think of benwick my tongue is tied,1,1,0.5133650003675491
she had only time however to move closer to the table where he had been writing when footsteps were heard returning the door opened it was himself he begged their pardon but he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room to the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper placed it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room almost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it the work of an instant,1,1,0.7795040796468387
the revolution which one instant had made in anne was almost beyond expression the letter with a direction hardly legible to miss a e -- was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick he had been also addressing her on the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her anything was possible anything might be defied rather than suspense mrs musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table to their protection she must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupied succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written her eyes devoured the following words,1,1,0.9524716892493815
do you think so but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry will you promise me to mention it when you see them again you will see them both this morning i dare say do promise me,1,1,0.7570184089356488
to be sure i will if you wish it charles if you see captain harville anywhere remember to give miss anne's message but indeed my dear you need not be uneasy captain harville holds himself quite engaged i'll answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say,1,1,0.9813495749288594
from that period his penance had become severe he had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of louisa's accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again than he had begun to feel himself though alive not at liberty,1,1,0.69943243117738
i found said he that i was considered by harville an engaged man that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment i was startled and shocked to a degree i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect that others might have felt the same -- her own family nay perhaps herself -- i was no longer at my own disposal i was hers in honour if she wished it i had been unguarded i had not thought seriously on this subject before i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill effects i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences,1,1,0.9878541802943687
i was six weeks with edward said he and saw him happy i could have no other pleasure i deserved none he enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter,1,1,0.884118934984849
it was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said --,1,1,0.6664525209139541
would i was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough,1,1,0.534884467650545
good god he cried you would it is not that i did not think of it or desire it as what could alone crown all my other success but i was proud too proud to ask again i did not understand you i shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself six years of separation and suffering might have been spared it is a sort of pain too which is new to me i have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that i enjoyed i have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards like other great men under reverses he added with a smile i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve,1,1,0.8312119314000167
mrs clay's affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed for the young man's sake the possibility of scheming longer for sir walter she has abilities however as well as affections and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hers may finally carry the day whether after preventing her from being the wife of sir walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of sir william,1,1,0.940580750471926
the family of dashwood had long been settled in sussex their estate was large and their residence was at norland park in the centre of their property where for many generations they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance the late owner of this estate was a single man who lived to a very advanced age and who for many years of his life had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister but her death which happened ten years before his own produced a great alteration in his home for to supply her loss he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew mr henry dashwood the legal inheritor of the norland estate and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it in the society of his nephew and niece and their children the old gentleman's days were comfortably spent his attachment to them all increased the constant attention of mr and mrs henry dashwood to his wishes which proceeded not merely from interest but from goodness of heart gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence,1,1,0.991072817492065
mr dashwood's disappointment was at first severe but his temper was cheerful and sanguine and he might reasonably hope to live many years and by living economically lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large and capable of almost immediate improvement but the fortune which had been so tardy in coming was his only one twelvemonth he survived his uncle no longer and ten thousand pounds including the late legacies was all that remained for his widow and daughters,1,1,0.9569568791302215
mr john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable his father was rendered easy by such an assurance and mr john dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them,1,1,0.9845057130349256
he was not an ill-disposed young man unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed but he was in general well respected for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties had he married a more amiable woman he might have been made still more respectable than he was -- he might even have been made amiable himself for he was very young when he married and very fond of his wife but mrs john dashwood was a strong caricature of himself -- more narrow-minded and selfish,1,1,0.9696800430799666
so acutely did mrs dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour and so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it that on the arrival of the latter she would have quitted the house for ever had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother,1,1,0.9873704901650362
elinor this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possessed a strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which qualified her though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother and enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them all that eagerness of mind in mrs dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence she had an excellent heart -- her disposition was affectionate and her feelings were strong but she knew how to govern them it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught,1,1,0.9916627128516547
elinor saw with concern the excess of her sister's sensibility but by mrs dashwood it was valued and cherished they encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction the agony of grief which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed was sought for was created again and again they gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future elinor too was deeply afflicted but still she could struggle she could exert herself she could consult with her brother could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival and treat her with proper attention and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance,1,1,0.9950662413908202
mrs john dashwood now installed herself mistress of norland and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors as such however they were treated by her with quiet civility and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself his wife and their child he really pressed them with some earnestness to consider norland as their home and as no plan appeared so eligible to mrs dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood his invitation was accepted,1,1,0.9949405458445345
well then let something be done for them but that something need not be three thousand pounds consider she added that when the money is once parted with it never can return your sisters will marry and it will be gone for ever if indeed it could be restored to our poor little boy --,1,1,0.8009465952881609
i would not wish to do any thing mean he replied one had rather on such occasions do too much than too little no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more,1,1,0.8419818438460387
his wife hesitated a little however in giving her consent to this plan,1,1,0.8204561540709672
undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it they think themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises no gratitude at all if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses,1,1,0.915165513318853
that is a material consideration undoubtedly a valuable legacy indeed and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here,1,1,0.81636605452717
mrs dashwood remained at norland several months not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while for when her spirits began to revive and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances she was impatient to be gone and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible but she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income which her mother would have approved,1,1,0.9935319350678148
this circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of mrs john dashwood a gentleman-like and pleasing young man who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister's establishment at norland and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there,1,1,0.9938114968475088
no sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to elinor than she considered their serious attachment as certain and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching,1,1,0.9334849299317827
perhaps said marianne i may consider it with some surprise edward is very amiable and i love him tenderly but yet -- he is not the kind of young man -- there is something wanting -- his figure is not striking it has none of that grace which i should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister his eyes want all that spirit that fire which at once announce virtue and intelligence and besides all this i am afraid mamma he has no real taste music seems scarcely to attract him and though he admires elinor's drawings very much it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth it is evident in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws that in fact he knows nothing of the matter he admires as a lover not as a connoisseur to satisfy me those characters must be united i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own he must enter into all my feelings the same books the same music must charm us both oh mama how spiritless how tame was edward's manner in reading to us last night i felt for my sister most severely yet she bore it with so much composure she seemed scarcely to notice it i could hardly keep my seat to hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference --,1,1,0.9585159696261968
marianne was afraid of offending and said no more on the subject but the kind of approbation which elinor described as excited in him by the drawings of other people was very far from that rapturous delight which in her opinion could alone be called taste yet though smiling within herself at the mistake she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to edward which produced it,1,1,0.9887844737292049
marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased,1,1,0.9589669624776627
in the evening as marianne was discovered to be musical she was invited to play the instrument was unlocked every body prepared to be charmed and marianne who sang very well at their request went through the chief of the songs which lady middleton had brought into the family on her marriage and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music although by her mother's account she had played extremely well and by her own was very fond of it,1,1,0.966398323879205
the immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both at the park she laughed at the colonel and in the cottage at marianne to the former her raillery was probably as far as it regarded only himself perfectly indifferent but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible and when its object was understood she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity or censure its impertinence for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel's advanced years and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor,1,1,0.944874036300723
mrs dashwood who could not think a man five years younger than herself so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter ventured to clear mrs jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age,1,1,0.9661552492084532
but at least mamma you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured colonel brandon is certainly younger than mrs jennings but he is old enough to be my father and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have long outlived every sensation of the kind it is too ridiculous when is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity will not protect him,1,1,0.9460258444275472
perhaps said elinor thirty-five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty i should not think colonel brandon's being thirty-five any objection to his marrying her,1,1,0.9563262031105281
i have never mentioned it to her but of course she must,1,1,0.8485695953854234
the dashwoods were now settled at barton with tolerable comfort to themselves the house and the garden with all the objects surrounding them were now become familiar and the ordinary pursuits which had given to norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than norland had been able to afford since the loss of their father sir john middleton who called on them every day for the first fortnight and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed,1,1,0.9855298135544768
willoughby cried sir john what is he in the country that is good news however i will ride over tomorrow and ask him to dinner on thursday,1,1,0.7921289516415422
upon my soul said he i do not know much about him as to all that but he is a pleasant good humoured fellow and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer i ever saw was she out with him today,1,0,0.3335839496096882
but who is he said elinor where does he come from has he a house at allenham,1,1,0.7419462017542398
on this point sir john could give more certain intelligence and he told them that mr willoughby had no property of his own in the country that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at allenham court to whom he was related and whose possessions he was to inherit adding yes yes he is very well worth catching i can tell you miss dashwood he has a pretty little estate of his own in somersetshire besides and if i were you i would not give him up to my younger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself brandon will be jealous if she does not take care,1,1,0.9837773909922538
i do not believe said mrs dashwood with a good humoured smile that mr willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what you call catching him it is not an employment to which they have been brought up men are very safe with us let them be ever so rich i am glad to find however from what you say that he is a respectable young man and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible,1,1,0.9435770584480399
that is what i like that is what a young man ought to be whatever be his pursuits his eagerness in them should know no moderation and leave him no sense of fatigue,1,1,0.6836113626869227
in mrs dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in marianne's and elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister of saying too much what he thought on every occasion without attention to persons or circumstances in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety he displayed a want of caution which elinor could not approve in spite of all that he and marianne could say in its support,1,1,0.9941480314811963
that he is patronised by you replied willoughby is certainly in his favour but as for the esteem of the others it is a reproach in itself who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as lady middleton and mrs jennings that could command the indifference of any body else,1,1,0.9748231912366584
that is to say cried marianne contemptuously he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome,1,1,0.5008279713101432
i do not dislike him i consider him on the contrary as a very respectable man who has every body's good word and nobody's notice who has more money than he can spend more time than he knows how to employ and two new coats every year,1,1,0.8345323009573681
elinor's happiness was not so great her heart was not so much at ease nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure they afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret than ever neither lady middleton nor mrs jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed although the latter was an everlasting talker and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse she had already repeated her own history to elinor three or four times and had elinor's memory been equal to her means of improvement she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of mr jenning's last illness and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died lady middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired she had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before her insipidity was invariable for even her spirits were always the same and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home -- and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others by any share in their conversation that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys,1,1,0.9986760116778451
upon my word i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment's being pardonable,1,1,0.8578351016442294
most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair and for some time she refused to submit to them as to an additional servant the expense would be a trifle mamma she was sure would never object to it and any horse would do for him he might always get one at the park as to a stable the merest shed would be sufficient elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little or at least so lately known to her this was too much,1,1,0.9820086966320682
you are mistaken elinor said she warmly in supposing i know very little of willoughby i have not known him long indeed but i am much better acquainted with him than i am with any other creature in the world except yourself and mama it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy -- it is disposition alone seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others i should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother than from willoughby of john i know very little though we have lived together for years but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed,1,1,0.9889705993164013
elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more she knew her sister's temper opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion but by an appeal to her affection for her mother by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself if as would probably be the case she consented to this increase of establishment marianne was shortly subdued and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer and to tell willoughby when she saw him next that it must be declined,1,1,0.9912469677445398
this was all overheard by miss dashwood and in the whole of the sentence in his manner of pronouncing it and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone she instantly saw an intimacy so decided a meaning so direct as marked a perfect agreement between them from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she or any of their friends should be left by tempers so frank to discover it by accident,1,1,0.9163462756323275
margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister when mrs jennings attacked her one evening at the park to give the name of the young man who was elinor's particular favourite which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her margaret answered by looking at her sister and saying i must not tell may i elinor,1,1,0.9887635020281941
remember that whatever your conjectures may be you have no right to repeat them,1,0,0.44527966208335557
i must not tell ma'am but i know very well what it is and i know where he is too,1,1,0.5973028922008086
yes yes we can guess where he is at his own house at norland to be sure he is the curate of the parish i dare say,1,1,0.7153357619140516
no that he is not he is of no profession at all,1,1,0.5565287675134108
margaret said marianne with great warmth you know that all this is an invention of your own and that there is no such person in existence,1,1,0.862304945231938
well then he is lately dead marianne for i am sure there was such a man once and his name begins with an f,1,1,0.5268863422695841
most grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton for observing at this moment that it rained very hard though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her than from her ladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother the idea however started by her was immediately pursued by colonel brandon who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them willoughby opened the piano-forte and asked marianne to sit down to it and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic it fell to the ground but not so easily did elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her,1,1,0.9942686174943103
by ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park where they were to breakfast the morning was rather favourable though it had rained all night as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky and the sun frequently appeared they were all in high spirits and good humour eager to be happy and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise,1,1,0.7370819940969956
perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny is married said mrs jennings without attending to her daughter's reproof,1,1,0.9817710673395915
whom do you mean ma'am said he colouring a little,1,1,0.6557194519145181
in town cried mrs jennings what can you have to do in town at this time of year,1,1,0.9071690201778866
my own loss is great be continued in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party but i am the more concerned as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at whitwell,1,1,0.9123471555681316
you would not be six hours later said willoughby if you were to defer your journey till our return,1,1,0.7788244325772048
colonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable,1,1,0.8216082631759944
ay so do sir john cried mrs jennings and then perhaps you may find out what his business is,1,1,0.9281187781474259
i do not want to pry into other men's concerns i suppose it is something he is ashamed of,1,1,0.5359735801861731
well as you are resolved to go i wish you a good journey but you had better change your mind,1,1,0.7645255305429478
yes yes mr impudence i know that very well and i was determined to find out where you had been to -- i hope you like your house miss marianne it is a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new-furnished it for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago,1,1,0.8786958381274959
elinor could hardly believe this to be true as it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose or marianne consent to enter the house while mrs smith was in it with whom marianne had not the smallest acquaintance,1,1,0.9948131779608239
why should you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that we did not see the house is not it what you have often wished to do yourself,1,1,0.8230951122725669
if the impertinent remarks of mrs jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of our lives i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs smith's grounds or in seeing her house they will one day be mr willoughby's and --,1,1,0.989134155828025
if they were one day to be your own marianne you would not be justified in what you have done,1,1,0.8093264575719008
something very melancholy must be the matter i am sure said she i could see it in his face poor man i am afraid his circumstances may be bad the estate at delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year and his brother left everything sadly involved i do think he must have been sent for about money matters for what else can it be i wonder whether it is so i would give anything to know the truth of it perhaps it is about miss williams and by the bye i dare say it is because he looked so conscious when i mentioned her may be she is ill in town nothing in the world more likely for i have a notion she is always rather sickly i would lay any wager it is about miss williams it is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances now for he is a very prudent man and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time i wonder what it can be may be his sister is worse at avignon and has sent for him over his setting off in such a hurry seems very like it well i wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart and a good wife into the bargain,1,1,0.9333455895904867
so wondered so talked mrs jennings her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture and all seeming equally probable as they arose elinor though she felt really interested in the welfare of colonel brandon could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away which mrs jennings was desirous of her feeling for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation her wonder was otherwise disposed of it was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby on the subject which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all as this silence continued every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both why they should not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place elinor could not imagine,1,1,0.9981420041941997
she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power for though willoughby was independent there was no reason to believe him rich his estate had been rated by sir john at about six or seven hundred a year but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal and he had himself often complained of his poverty but for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement which in fact concealed nothing at all she could not account and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of marianne,1,1,0.9920195427226777
nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all than willoughby's behaviour to marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's heart could give and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother the cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home many more of his hours were spent there than at allenham and if no general engagement collected them at the park the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of marianne and by his favourite pointer at her feet,1,1,0.9866626663965652
thank you willoughby but you may be assured that i would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours or of any one whom i loved for all the improvements in the world depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain when i make up my accounts in the spring i would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you but are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it,1,1,0.8902057865795848
i am said he to me it is faultless nay more i consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable and were i rich enough i would instantly pull combe down and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage,1,1,0.594522621572831
there certainly are circumstances said willoughby which might greatly endear it to me but this place will always have one claim of my affection which no other can possibly share,1,1,0.9116412810495135
his colour increased and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied you are too good,1,0,0.36295931352696503
mrs dashwood looked at elinor with surprise elinor felt equal amazement for a few moments every one was silent mrs dashwood first spoke,1,1,0.9897515170500252
my engagements at present replied willoughby confusedly are of such a nature -- that -- i dare not flatter myself --,1,1,0.8397794506893888
then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened oh elinor how incomprehensible are your feelings you had rather take evil upon credit than good you had rather look out for misery for marianne and guilt for poor willoughby than an apology for the latter you are resolved to think him blameable because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment are no probabilities to be accepted merely because they are not certainties is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love and no reason in the world to think ill of to the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves though unavoidably secret for a while and after all what is it you suspect him of,1,1,0.9744337566037472
do not blame him however for departing from his character where the deviation is necessary but you really do admit the justice of what i have said in his defence -- i am happy -- and he is acquitted,1,1,0.6716501841753758
not entirely it may be proper to conceal their engagement if they are engaged from mrs smith -- and if that is the case it must be highly expedient for willoughby to be but little in devonshire at present but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us,1,1,0.965697369421929
but with a strange kind of tenderness if he can leave her with such indifference such carelessness of the future as you attribute to him,1,1,0.7308328280366088
marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able to sleep at all the first night after parting from willoughby she would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it but the feelings which made such composure a disgrace left her in no danger of incurring it she was awake the whole night and she wept the greatest part of it she got up with a headache was unable to talk and unwilling to take any nourishment giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either her sensibility was potent enough,1,1,0.9670053118223598
the evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling she played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to willoughby every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained and this nourishment of grief was every day applied she spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying her voice often totally suspended by her tears in books too as well as in music she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving she read nothing but what they had been used to read together,1,1,0.9306643600015322
elinor thought this generosity overstrained considering her sister's youth and urged the matter farther but in vain common sense common care common prudence were all sunk in mrs dashwood's romantic delicacy,1,1,0.9216131200014596
one morning about a week after his leaving the country marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk instead of wandering away by herself hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles if her sisters intended to walk on the downs she directly stole away towards the lanes if they talked of the valley she was as speedy in climbing the hills and could never be found when the others set off but at length she was secured by the exertions of elinor who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion they walked along the road through the valley and chiefly in silence for marianne's mind could not be controlled and elinor satisfied with gaining one point would not then attempt more beyond the entrance of the valley where the country though still rich was less wild and more open a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming to barton lay before them and on reaching that point they stopped to look around them and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the cottage from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before,1,1,0.9419236690734014
amongst the objects in the scene they soon discovered an animated one it was a man on horseback riding towards them in a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman and in a moment afterwards marianne rapturously exclaimed,1,1,0.8296703688808478
she walked eagerly on as she spoke and elinor to screen marianne from particularity as she felt almost certain of its not being willoughby quickened her pace and kept up with her they were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman marianne looked again her heart sunk within her and abruptly turning round she was hurrying back when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her a third almost as well known as willoughby's joined them in begging her to stop and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome edward ferrars,1,1,0.9469504453593391
a fortnight she repeated surprised at his being so long in the same county with elinor without seeing her before,1,1,0.9213147273065998
it is not every one said elinor who has your passion for dead leaves,1,0,0.30113279292101397
no my feelings are not often shared not often understood but sometimes they are -- as she said this she sunk into a reverie for a few moments -- but rousing herself again now edward said she calling his attention to the prospect here is barton valley look up to it and be tranquil if you can look at those hills did you ever see their equals to the left is barton park amongst those woods and plantations you may see the end of the house and there beneath that farthest hill which rises with such grandeur is our cottage,1,1,0.826831708205183
how strange said marianne to herself as she walked on,1,1,0.8571001619377524
no i hope my mother is now convinced that i have no more talents than inclination for a public life,1,1,0.8670764691843433
grandeur has but little said elinor but wealth has much to do with it,1,1,0.7646511344972805
and yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income said marianne a family cannot well be maintained on a smaller i am sure i am not extravagant in my demands a proper establishment of servants a carriage perhaps two and hunters cannot be supported on less,1,1,0.9268757425340503
elinor smiled again to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at combe magna,1,1,0.8977597134607297
hunters repeated edward -- but why must you have hunters every body does not hunt,1,1,0.5728189327651108
marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point,1,1,0.8591198617402528
undoubtedly at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed it is not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to change them,1,1,0.8233762608553881
quite the contrary replied elinor looking expressively at marianne,1,1,0.9414931367769711
he joined her and marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning before the others were down and marianne who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could soon left them to themselves but before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open and turning round was astonished to see edward himself come out,1,1,0.9611769301341748
edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding country in his walk to the village he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage and the village itself in a much higher situation than the cottage afforded a general view of the whole which had exceedingly pleased him this was a subject which ensured marianne's attention and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him when edward interrupted her by saying you must not enquire too far marianne -- remember i have no knowledge in the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars i shall call hills steep which ought to be bold surfaces strange and uncouth which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give i call it a very fine country -- the hills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber and the valley looks comfortable and snug -- with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there it exactly answers my idea of a fine country because it unites beauty with utility -- and i dare say it is a picturesque one too because you admire it i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me i know nothing of the picturesque,1,1,0.7877307228058317
marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her sister elinor only laughed,1,1,0.9822617668560527
before the middle of the day they were visited by sir john and mrs jennings who having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage came to take a survey of the guest with the assistance of his mother-in-law sir john was not long in discovering that the name of ferrars began with an f and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted elinor which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung but as it was she only learned from some very significant looks how far their penetration founded on margaret's instructions extended,1,1,0.9804804436023472
marianne was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner and after a moment's silence said,1,1,0.7341706464448724
edward remained a week at the cottage he was earnestly pressed by mrs dashwood to stay longer but as if he were bent only on self-mortification he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height his spirits during the last two or three days though still very unequal were greatly improved -- he grew more and more partial to the house and environs -- never spoke of going away without a sigh -- declared his time to be wholly disengaged -- even doubted to what place he should go when he left them -- but still go he must never had any week passed so quickly -- he could hardly believe it to be gone he said so repeatedly other things he said too which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions he had no pleasure at norland he detested being in town but either to norland or london he must go he valued their kindness beyond any thing and his greatest happiness was in being with them yet he must leave them at the end of a week in spite of their wishes and his own and without any restraint on his time,1,1,0.9839717733917394
i think replied edward that i may defy many months to produce any good to me,1,1,0.8475185363948805
such behaviour as this so exactly the reverse of her own appeared no more meritorious to marianne than her own had seemed faulty to her the business of self-command she settled very easily -- with strong affections it was impossible with calm ones it could have no merit that her sister's affections were calm she dared not deny though she blushed to acknowledge it and of the strength of her own she gave a very striking proof by still loving and respecting that sister in spite of this mortifying conviction,1,1,0.9844150189612099
as elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes without taking that liberty she begged to be excused,1,1,0.9511764249453114
where is marianne has she run away because we are come i see her instrument is open,1,1,0.6008614603536144
mrs palmer on the contrary who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth,1,1,0.9104996686159252
mrs jennings in the meantime talked on as loud as she could and continued her account of their surprise the evening before on seeing their friends without ceasing till every thing was told mrs palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment and every body agreed two or three times over that it had been quite an agreeable surprise,1,1,0.9838315252630022
you may believe how glad we all were to see them added mrs jennings leaning forward towards elinor and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else though they were seated on different sides of the room but however i can't help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey of it for they came all round by london upon account of some business for you know nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter it was wrong in her situation i wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning but she would come with us she longed so much to see you all,1,1,0.9530149559449614
lady middleton could no longer endure such a conversation and therefore exerted herself to ask mr palmer if there was any news in the paper,1,1,0.9698048303777537
here comes marianne cried sir john now palmer you shall see a monstrous pretty girl,1,1,0.8586011029104363
oh dear how beautiful these are well how delightful do but look mama how sweet i declare they are quite charming i could look at them for ever and then sitting down again she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room,1,1,0.8159667320309983
my love have you been asleep said his wife laughing,1,0,0.3111875103471686
he made her no answer and only observed after again examining the room that it was very low pitched and that the ceiling was crooked he then made his bow and departed with the rest,1,0,0.359909056511024
why should they ask us said marianne as soon as they were gone the rent of this cottage is said to be low but we have it on very hard terms if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them or with us,1,1,0.8167356631587467
my dear said he to his lady it is very provoking that we should be so few why did not you ask the gilberts to come to us today,1,1,0.6030363756319378
charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid of her and exultingly said she did not care how cross he was to her as they must live together it was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly good-natured or more determined to be happy than mrs palmer the studied indifference insolence and discontent of her husband gave her no pain and when he scolded or abused her she was highly diverted,1,1,0.9784589823484877
mr palmer is so droll said she in a whisper to elinor he is always out of humour,1,1,0.9411409869353881
certainly said elinor he seems very agreeable,1,1,0.9441975516470454
well -- i am so glad you do i thought you would he is so pleasant and mr palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters i can tell you and you can't think how disappointed he will be if you don't come to cleveland -- i can't imagine why you should object to it,1,1,0.904077134226716
elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation and by changing the subject put a stop to her entreaties she thought it probable that as they lived in the same county mrs palmer might be able to give some more particular account of willoughby's general character than could be gathered from the middletons' partial acquaintance with him and she was eager to gain from any one such a confirmation of his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from marianne she began by inquiring if they saw much of mr willoughby at cleveland and whether they were intimately acquainted with him,1,1,0.9971839398198059
did not colonel brandon know of sir john's proposal to your mother before it was made had he never owned his affection to yourself,1,1,0.9361893520585169
do come now said he -- pray come -- you must come -- i declare you shall come -- you can't think how you will like them lucy is monstrous pretty and so good humoured and agreeable the children are all hanging about her already as if she was an old acquaintance and they both long to see you of all things for they have heard at exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world and i have told them it is all very true and a great deal more you will be delighted with them i am sure they have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children how can you be so cross as not to come why they are your cousins you know after a fashion you are my cousins and they are my wife's so you must be related,1,1,0.7584382355391636
when their promised visit to the park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place they found in the appearance of the eldest who was nearly thirty with a very plain and not a sensible face nothing to admire but in the other who was not more than two or three and twenty they acknowledged considerable beauty her features were pretty and she had a sharp quick eye and a smartness of air which though it did not give actual elegance or grace gave distinction to her person -- their manners were particularly civil and elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to lady middleton with her children they were in continual raptures extolling their beauty courting their notice and humouring their whims and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing if she happened to be doing any thing or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles a fond mother though in pursuit of praise for her children the most rapacious of human beings is likewise the most credulous her demands are exorbitant but she will swallow any thing and the excessive affection and endurance of the miss steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by lady middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust she saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted she saw their sashes untied their hair pulled about their ears their work-bags searched and their knives and scissors stolen away and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment it suggested no other surprise than that elinor and marianne should sit so composedly by without claiming a share in what was passing,1,1,0.9922017580015496
yet i hardly know how cried marianne unless it had been under totally different circumstances but this is the usual way of heightening alarm where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality,1,1,0.7903037568452381
i confess replied elinor that while i am at barton park i never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence,1,1,0.9087121625857274
and had you a great many smart beaux there i suppose you have not so many in this part of the world for my part i think they are a vast addition always,1,1,0.5891250448627094
but why should you think said lucy looking ashamed of her sister that there are not as many genteel young men in devonshire as sussex,1,1,0.8703726904808323
nay my dear i'm sure i don't pretend to say that there an't i'm sure there's a vast many smart beaux in exeter but you know how could i tell what smart beaux there might be about norland and i was only afraid the miss dashwoods might find it dull at barton if they had not so many as they used to have but perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux and had as lief be without them as with them for my part i think they are vastly agreeable provided they dress smart and behave civil but i can't bear to see them dirty and nasty now there's mr rose at exeter a prodigious smart young man quite a beau clerk to mr simpson you know and yet if you do but meet him of a morning he is not fit to be seen -- i suppose your brother was quite a beau miss dashwood before he married as he was so rich,1,1,0.9558933228293803
lord anne cried her sister you can talk of nothing but beaux -- you will make miss dashwood believe you think of nothing else and then to turn the discourse she began admiring the house and the furniture,1,1,0.9238111152204708
the miss steeles as she expected had now all the benefit of these jokes and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman alluded to which though often impertinently expressed was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness into the concerns of their family but sir john did not sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name as miss steele had in hearing it,1,1,0.9756731534556478
ferrars repeated miss steele mr ferrars is the happy man is he what your sister-in-law's brother miss dashwood a very agreeable young man to be sure i know him very well,1,1,0.9909495142837713
how can you say so anne cried lucy who generally made an amendment to all her sister's assertions though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle's it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well,1,1,0.919510187014267
i am sure you think me very strange for enquiring about her in such a way said lucy eyeing elinor attentively as she spoke but perhaps there may be reasons -- i wish i might venture but however i hope you will do me the justice of believing that i do not mean to be impertinent,1,1,0.9276343014031685
i dare say you are and i am sure i do not at all wonder at it but if i dared tell you all you would not be so much surprised mrs ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present -- but the time may come -- how soon it will come must depend upon herself -- when we may be very intimately connected,1,1,0.9493505943253696
she looked down as she said this amiably bashful with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her,1,1,0.5669714598101249
no replied lucy not to mr robert ferrars -- i never saw him in my life but fixing her eyes upon elinor to his eldest brother,1,1,0.9862738590887105
yes mr pratt did you never hear him talk of mr pratt,1,1,0.7095231325894992
no considering our situation it was not strange our first care has been to keep the matter secret -- you knew nothing of me or my family and therefore there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name to you and as he was always particularly afraid of his sister's suspecting any thing that was reason enough for his not mentioning it,1,1,0.8841971860063791
she put it into her hands as she spoke and when elinor saw the painting whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision or her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind she could have none of its being edward's face she returned it almost instantly acknowledging the likeness,1,1,0.9071322472010611
here she took out her handkerchief but elinor did not feel very compassionate,1,1,0.8230907431264491
pardon me replied elinor startled by the question but i can give you no advice under such circumstances your own judgment must direct you,1,1,0.8884695676080534
much as she had suffered from her first conversation with lucy on the subject she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it and this for more reasons than one she wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again she wanted more clearly to understand what lucy really felt for edward whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him and she particularly wanted to convince lucy by her readiness to enter on the matter again and her calmness in conversing on it that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend which she very much feared her involuntary agitation in their morning discourse must have left at least doubtful that lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable it was plain that edward had always spoken highly in her praise not merely from lucy's assertion but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance with a secret so confessedly and evidently important and even sir john's joking intelligence must have had some weight but indeed while elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by edward it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that lucy should be jealous and that she was so her very confidence was a proof what other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be but that elinor might be informed by it of lucy's superior claims on edward and be taught to avoid him in future she had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival's intentions and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed to combat her own affection for edward and to see him as little as possible she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy that her heart was unwounded and as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure,1,1,0.9993347262594242
i am glad said lady middleton to lucy you are not going to finish poor little annamaria's basket this evening for i am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight and we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow and then i hope she will not much mind it,1,1,0.9354276719733727
lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child,1,1,0.9299379602178747
oh that would be terrible indeed said miss steele -- dear little soul how i do love her,1,1,0.7402440266174762
i should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with if i felt no desire for its continuance or no farther curiosity on its subject i will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again,1,1,0.8000937415035148
all this thought elinor is very pretty but it can impose upon neither of us,1,1,0.8350761038541499
if we could be certain that it would be only for a while but mrs ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it would very likely secure every thing to robert and the idea of that for edward's sake frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures,1,1,0.9644803809454913
a great coxcomb repeated miss steele whose ear had caught those words by a sudden pause in marianne's music -- oh they are talking of their favourite beaux i dare say,1,1,0.811937278520752
i should always be happy replied elinor to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr ferrars but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary he is brother to mrs john dashwood -- that must be recommendation enough to her husband,1,1,0.9932396257128111
no answered elinor with a smile which concealed very agitated feelings on such a subject i certainly will not you know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you unless it were on the side of your wishes,1,1,0.9300414887016063
shall you be in town this winter miss dashwood said she with all her accustomary complacency,1,1,0.9141350215405741
it will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do,1,1,0.6898793775817322
my objection is this though i think very well of mrs jennings's heart she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure or whose protection will give us consequence,1,1,0.9205164184485984
elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel with regard to herself it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not and when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan and her sister exhilarated by it in look voice and manner restored to all her usual animation and elevated to more than her usual gaiety she could not be dissatisfied with the cause and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence,1,1,0.9888035961158262
mrs jennings soon came in oh colonel said she with her usual noisy cheerfulness i am monstrous glad to see you -- sorry i could not come before -- beg your pardon but i have been forced to look about me a little and settle my matters for it is a long while since i have been at home and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time and then i have had cartwright to settle with -- lord i have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner but pray colonel how came you to conjure out that i should be in town today,1,1,0.8878332744763261
i had the pleasure of hearing it at mr palmer's where i have been dining,1,1,0.940396555240933
mrs palmer appeared quite well and i am commissioned to tell you that you will certainly see her to-morrow,1,1,0.893489236336584
ay my dear i'll warrant you we do mary always has her own way,1,1,0.7148495596310221
nor i answered marianne with energy our situations then are alike we have neither of us any thing to tell you because you do not communicate and i because i conceal nothing,1,1,0.5498885883233587
her letter was scarcely finished when a rap foretold a visitor and colonel brandon was announced marianne who had seen him from the window and who hated company of any kind left the room before he entered it he looked more than usually grave and though expressing satisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone as if he had somewhat in particular to tell her sat for some time without saying a word elinor persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned impatiently expected its opening it was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction for more than once before beginning with the observation of your sister looks unwell to-day or your sister seems out of spirits he had appeared on the point either of disclosing or of inquiring something particular about her after a pause of several minutes their silence was broken by his asking her in a voice of some agitation when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother elinor was not prepared for such a question and having no answer ready was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient of asking what he meant he tried to smile as he replied your sister's engagement to mr willoughby is very generally known,1,1,0.9942137279500606
how can that be by whom can you have heard it mentioned,1,1,0.6696297167247554
nothing occurred during the next three or four days to make elinor regret what she had done in applying to her mother for willoughby neither came nor wrote they were engaged about the end of that time to attend lady middleton to a party from which mrs jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter and for this party marianne wholly dispirited careless of her appearance and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid prepared without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure she sat by the drawing-room fire after tea till the moment of lady middleton's arrival without once stirring from her seat or altering her attitude lost in her own thoughts and insensible of her sister's presence and when at last they were told that lady middleton waited for them at the door she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected,1,1,0.9928043185992916
at last he turned round again and regarded them both she started up and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection held out her hand to him he approached and addressing himself rather to elinor than marianne as if wishing to avoid her eye and determined not to observe her attitude inquired in a hurried manner after mrs dashwood and asked how long they had been in town elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address and was unable to say a word but the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed her face was crimsoned over and she exclaimed in a voice of the greatest emotion good god willoughby what is the meaning of this have you not received my letters will you not shake hands with me,1,1,0.9771631776919497
the sort of desperate calmness with which this was said lasted no longer than while she spoke and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction it was some minutes before she could go on with her letter and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her at intervals to withhold her pen were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to willoughby,1,1,0.962149329352537
at breakfast she neither ate nor attempted to eat any thing and elinor's attention was then all employed not in urging her not in pitying her nor in appearing to regard her but in endeavouring to engage mrs jenning's notice entirely to herself,1,1,0.9701793217197102
forgive me forgive me throwing her arms round her sister's neck i know you feel for me i know what a heart you have but yet you are -- you must be happy edward loves you -- what oh what can do away such happiness as that,1,1,0.6534103920594647
elinor said no more and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before directly ran over the contents of all the first which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town was to this effect,1,1,0.9020404747034219
her second note which had been written on the morning after the dance at the middletons' was in these words --,1,1,0.6689072337018434
i cannot express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which i sent you above a week ago i have been expecting to hear from you and still more to see you every hour of the day pray call again as soon as possible and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain you had better come earlier another time because we are generally out by one we were last night at lady middleton's where there was a dance i have been told that you were asked to be of the party but could it be so you must be very much altered indeed since we parted if that could be the case and you not there but i will not suppose this possible and i hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise,1,1,0.9665244865819106
for a moment or two she could say no more but when this emotion had passed away she added in a firmer tone,1,1,0.7091019104826588
elinor would not contend and only replied whoever may have been so detestably your enemy let them be cheated of their malignant triumph my dear sister by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits it is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence,1,1,0.7950394213592442
no no cried marianne misery such as mine has no pride i care not who knows that i am wretched the triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world elinor elinor they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like -- may resist insult or return mortification -- but i cannot i must feel -- i must be wretched -- and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can,1,1,0.9397824959702227
it is too much oh willoughby willoughby could this be yours cruel cruel -- nothing can acquit you elinor nothing can whatever he might have heard against me -- ought he not to have suspended his belief ought he not to have told me of it to have given me the power of clearing myself 'the lock of hair repeating it from the letter which you so obligingly bestowed on me' -- that is unpardonable willoughby where was your heart when you wrote those words oh barbarously insolent -- elinor can he be justified,1,1,0.9212220079291383
another pause ensued marianne was greatly agitated and it ended thus,1,1,0.7611772981007753
elinor i must go home i must go and comfort mama can not we be gone to-morrow,1,1,0.8990757391921018
yes why should i stay here i came only for willoughby's sake -- and now who cares for me who regards me,1,1,0.6631788248212093
it would be impossible to go to-morrow we owe mrs jennings much more than civility and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that,1,1,0.9395392718033402
do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is is she said to be amiable,1,1,0.6880236845782084
i never heard any harm of her indeed i hardly ever heard her mentioned except that mrs taylor did say this morning that one day miss walker hinted to her that she believed mr and mrs ellison would not be sorry to have miss grey married for she and mrs ellison could never agree --,1,1,0.9933412965967705
aye i believe that will be best for her let her name her own supper and go to bed lord no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two for this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that and so the letter that came today finished it poor soul i am sure if i had had a notion of it i would not have joked her about it for all my money but then you know how should i guess such a thing i made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter and you know young people like to be laughed at about them lord how concerned sir john and my daughters will be when they hear it if i had my senses about me i might have called in conduit street in my way home and told them of it but i shall see them tomorrow,1,1,0.8076693276472144
elinor for her sister's sake could not press the subject farther and she hoped it was not required of her for willoughby's since though marianne might lose much he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth after a short silence on both sides mrs jennings with all her natural hilarity burst forth again,1,1,0.9848507403426514
well my dear 'tis a true saying about an ill-wind for it will be all the better for colonel brandon he will have her at last aye that he will mind me now if they an't married by mid-summer lord how he'll chuckle over this news i hope he will come tonight it will be all to one a better match for your sister two thousand a year without debt or drawback -- except the little love-child indeed aye i had forgot her but she may be 'prenticed out at a small cost and then what does it signify delaford is a nice place i can tell you exactly what i call a nice old fashioned place full of comforts and conveniences quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees in the country and such a mulberry tree in one corner lord how charlotte and i did stuff the only time we were there then there is a dove-cote some delightful stew-ponds and a very pretty canal and every thing in short that one could wish for and moreover it is close to the church and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike-road so 'tis never dull for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house you may see all the carriages that pass along oh 'tis a nice place a butcher hard by in the village and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw to my fancy a thousand times prettier than barton park where they are forced to send three miles for their meat and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother well i shall spirit up the colonel as soon as i can one shoulder of mutton you know drives another down if we can but put willoughby out of her head,1,1,0.5030223548813691
you had better leave me was all the notice that her sister received from her,1,1,0.8934359239856758
i will leave you said elinor if you will go to bed but this from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering she at first refused to do her sister's earnest though gentle persuasion however soon softened her to compliance and elinor saw her lay her aching head on the pillow and as she hoped in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her,1,1,0.9450471387505623
my dear said she entering i have just recollected that i have some of the finest old constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted so i have brought a glass of it for your sister my poor husband how fond he was of it whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world do take it to your sister,1,1,0.7012348261793436
mrs jennings though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier was satisfied with the compromise and elinor as she swallowed the chief of it reflected that though its effects on a colicky gout were at present of little importance to her its healing powers on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister,1,1,0.9681860780903014
he shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her's and with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information inquired after her sister,1,1,0.7466039447111655
perhaps then he hesitatingly replied what i heard this morning may be -- there may be more truth in it than i could believe possible at first,1,1,0.7453473098249115
in a stationer's shop in pall mall where i had business two ladies were waiting for their carriage and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match in a voice so little attempting concealment that it was impossible for me not to hear all the name of willoughby john willoughby frequently repeated first caught my attention and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with miss grey -- it was no longer to be a secret -- it would take place even within a few weeks with many particulars of preparations and other matters one thing especially i remember because it served to identify the man still more -- as soon as the ceremony was over they were to go to combe magna his seat in somersetshire my astonishment -- but it would be impossible to describe what i felt the communicative lady i learnt on inquiry for i stayed in the shop till they were gone was a mrs ellison and that as i have been since informed is the name of miss grey's guardian,1,1,0.9810822103706366
it may be so but willoughby is capable -- at least i think -- he stopped a moment then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself and your sister -- how did she --,1,1,0.8220872134654214
i could meet him no other way eliza had confessed to me though most reluctantly the name of her lover and when he returned to town which was within a fortnight after myself we met by appointment he to defend i to punish his conduct we returned unwounded and the meeting therefore never got abroad,1,1,0.8147726385300255
no as soon as she recovered from her lying-in for i found her near her delivery i removed her and her child into the country and there she remains,1,1,0.7324293969015302
from all danger of seeing willoughby again her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends design could never bring them in each other's way negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of london than even in the retirement of barton where it might force him before her while paying that visit at allenham on his marriage which mrs dashwood from foreseeing at first as a probable event had brought herself to expect as a certain one,1,1,0.9915842134620128
she had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of february and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother,1,1,0.9073144027041342
the calm and polite unconcern of lady middleton on the occasion was a happy relief to elinor's spirits oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness of the others it was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in one person at least among their circle of friends a great comfort to know that there was one who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars or any anxiety for her sister's health,1,1,0.9881130581970621
lady middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day or twice if the subject occurred very often by saying it is very shocking indeed and by the means of this continual though gentle vent was able not only to see the miss dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies and therefore determined though rather against the opinion of sir john that as mrs willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune to leave her card with her as soon as she married,1,1,0.9966971149646023
well my dear said mrs jennings and how did you travel,1,1,0.8873232026253733
elinor with great civility declined the proposal her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed or in her dressing gown and therefore not able to come to them,1,1,0.8792823247067852
elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper but she was saved the trouble of checking it by lucy's sharp reprimand which now as on many occasions though it did not give much sweetness to the manners of one sister was of advantage in governing those of the other,1,1,0.9356887044954897
on ascending the stairs the miss dashwoods found so many people before them in the room that there was not a person at liberty to tend to their orders and they were obliged to wait all that could be done was to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession one gentleman only was standing there and it is probable that elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch but the correctness of his eye and the delicacy of his taste proved to be beyond his politeness he was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself and till its size shape and ornaments were determined all of which after examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares a kind of notice which served to imprint on elinor the remembrance of a person and face of strong natural sterling insignificance though adorned in the first style of fashion,1,1,0.9153658396944527
marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment on this impertinent examination of their features and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection by remaining unconscious of it all for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself and be as ignorant of what was passing around her in mr gray's shop as in her own bedroom,1,1,0.896095143393505
at last the affair was decided the ivory the gold and the pearls all received their appointment and the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick-case drew on his gloves with leisurely care and bestowing another glance on the miss dashwoods but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference,1,1,0.7918983212489347
elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward was on the point of concluding it when another gentleman presented himself at her side she turned her eyes towards his face and found him with some surprise to be her brother,1,1,0.8132139385731524
you are mistaken elinor you are very much mistaken a very little trouble on your side secures him perhaps just at present he may be undecided the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back his friends may all advise him against it but some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him in spite of himself and there can be no reason why you should not try for him it is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side -- in short you know as to an attachment of that kind it is quite out of the question the objections are insurmountable -- you have too much sense not to see all that colonel brandon must be the man and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family it is a match that must give universal satisfaction in short it is a kind of thing that -- lowering his voice to an important whisper -- will be exceedingly welcome to all parties recollecting himself however he added that is i mean to say -- your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled fanny particularly for she has your interest very much at heart i assure you and her mother too mrs ferrars a very good-natured woman i am sure it would give her great pleasure she said as much the other day,1,1,0.9893234345073098
he paused for her assent and compassion and she forced herself to say,1,1,0.8162976923312001
your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable but your income is a large one,1,1,0.6770584295572074
other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to norland our respected father as you well know bequeathed all the stanhill effects that remained at norland and very valuable they were to your mother far be it from me to repine at his doing so he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose but in consequence of it we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen china c to supply the place of what was taken away you may guess after all these expenses how very far we must be from being rich and how acceptable mrs ferrars's kindness is,1,1,0.9329521352505172
upon the knoll behind the house the old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it it will be a very fine object from many parts of the park and the flower-garden will slope down just before it and be exceedingly pretty we have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow,1,0,0.16434436531924454
having now said enough to make his poverty clear and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters in his next visit at gray's his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn and he began to congratulate elinor on having such a friend as mrs jennings,1,1,0.7690223782625676
elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying colonel brandon but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman and promoting the marriage by every possible attention he had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal and an offer from colonel brandon or a legacy from mrs jennings was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect,1,1,0.9939115210768854
lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished and miss steele wanted only to be teazed about dr davies to be perfectly happy,1,1,0.922074295922602
the dinner was a grand one the servants were numerous and every thing bespoke the mistress's inclination for show and the master's ability to support it in spite of the improvements and additions which were making to the norland estate and in spite of its owner having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it -- no poverty of any kind except of conversation appeared -- but there the deficiency was considerable john dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing and his wife had still less but there was no peculiar disgrace in this for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable -- want of sense either natural or improved -- want of elegance -- want of spirits -- or want of temper,1,1,0.9648684882170437
the two grandmothers with not less partiality but more sincerity were equally earnest in support of their own descendant,1,1,0.715461712700532
elinor having once delivered her opinion on william's side by which she offended mrs ferrars and fanny still more did not see the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion and marianne when called on for her's offended them all by declaring that she had no opinion to give as she had never thought about it,1,1,0.9849949625727611
before her removing from norland elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law which being now just mounted and brought home ornamented her present drawing room and these screens catching the eye of john dashwood on his following the other gentlemen into the room were officiously handed by him to colonel brandon for his admiration,1,1,0.9562838708208707
they are very pretty ma'am -- an't they but then again the dread of having been too civil too encouraging herself probably came over her for she presently added,1,1,0.9165526840379095
she could say no more her spirits were quite overcome and hiding her face on elinor's shoulder she burst into tears every body's attention was called and almost every body was concerned -- colonel brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did -- mrs jennings with a very intelligent ah poor dear immediately gave her her salts and sir john felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress that he instantly changed his seat to one close by lucy steele and gave her in a whisper a brief account of the whole shocking affair,1,1,0.9839022335630709
in a few minutes however marianne was recovered enough to put an end to the bustle and sit down among the rest though her spirits retained the impression of what had passed the whole evening,1,1,0.8760342784962842
elinor wished to talk of something else but lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness and elinor was obliged to go on --,1,1,0.9929336080949526
i am glad of it with all my heart but really you did not look it i should be sorry to have you ill you that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world -- heaven knows what i should have done without your friendship --,1,1,0.8119587896024135
indeed i am perfectly convinced of your regard for me and next to edward's love it is the greatest comfort i have -- poor edward -- but now there is one good thing we shall be able to meet and meet pretty often for lady middleton's delighted with mrs dashwood so we shall be a good deal in harley street i dare say and edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides lady middleton and mrs ferrars will visit now -- and mrs ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once they should always be glad to see me -- they are such charming women -- i am sure if ever you tell your sister what i think of her you cannot speak too high,1,1,0.997726492341673
elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph by the door's being thrown open the servant's announcing mr ferrars and edward's immediately walking in,1,1,0.973719728733144
lucy with a demure and settled air seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others and would not say a word and almost every thing that was said proceeded from elinor who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother's health their coming to town c which edward ought to have inquired about but never did,1,1,0.9704044567163697
do you like london said edward willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject,1,1,0.8462057877718574
and with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother till they were more in private,1,1,0.9112851694979089
engaged but what was that when such friends were to be met,1,1,0.8056591994850314
the nature of her commendation in the present case however happened to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors and was so very unexhilarating to edward that he very soon got up to go away,1,1,0.9312557110823433
he addressed her with easy civility and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by lucy happy had it been for her if her regard for edward had depended less on his own merit than on the merit of his nearest relations for then his brother's bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun but while she wondered at the difference of the two young men she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other why they were different robert exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour's conversation for talking of his brother and lamenting the extreme gaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency than to the misfortune of a private education while he himself though probably without any particular any material superiority by nature merely from the advantage of a public school was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man,1,1,0.9766744526858762
upon my soul he added i believe it is nothing more and so i often tell my mother when she is grieving about it 'my dear madam ' i always say to her 'you must make yourself easy the evil is now irremediable and it has been entirely your own doing why would you be persuaded by my uncle sir robert against your own judgment to place edward under private tuition at the most critical time of his life if you had only sent him to westminster as well as myself instead of sending him to mr pratt's all this would have been prevented ' this is the way in which i always consider the matter and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error,1,1,0.9615409034824722
elinor would not oppose his opinion because whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage of a public school she could not think of edward's abode in mr pratt's family with any satisfaction,1,1,0.9780227876623683
some people imagine that there can be no accommodations no space in a cottage but this is all a mistake i was last month at my friend elliott's near dartford lady elliott wished to give a dance 'but how can it be done ' said she 'my dear ferrars do tell me how it is to be managed there is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple and where can the supper be ' i immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it so i said 'my dear lady elliott do not be uneasy the dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room the library may be open for tea and other refreshments and let the supper be set out in the saloon ' lady elliott was delighted with the thought we measured the dining-room and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan so that in fact you see if people do but know how to set about it every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling,1,1,0.9372084549543125
fanny paused a moment and then with fresh vigor said,1,1,0.5452780448463249
my love i would ask them with all my heart if it was in my power but i had just settled within myself to ask the miss steeles to spend a few days with us they are very well behaved good kind of girls and i think the attention is due to them as their uncle did so very well by edward we can ask your sisters some other year you know but the miss steeles may not be in town any more i am sure you will like them indeed you do like them you know very much already and so does my mother and they are such favourites with harry,1,1,0.9567432866511182
about the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in berkeley street mrs jennings on returning from her ordinary visit to mrs palmer entered the drawing-room where elinor was sitting by herself with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful and giving her time only to form that idea began directly to justify it by saying,1,1,0.9721659416024048
her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement and the length of time it had existed -- marianne's feelings had then broken in and put an end to all regularity of detail and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress lessen her alarms and combat her resentment the first question on her side which led to farther particulars was,1,1,0.9418816859544921
i have known it these four months when lucy first came to barton park last november she told me in confidence of her engagement,1,1,0.9805059278284614
your sister he continued has suffered dreadfully mrs ferrars too -- in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress -- but i will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome poor fanny she was in hysterics all yesterday but i would not alarm you too much donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended her constitution is a good one and her resolution equal to any thing she has borne it all with the fortitude of an angel she says she never shall think well of anybody again and one cannot wonder at it after being so deceived -- meeting with such ingratitude where so much kindness had been shewn so much confidence had been placed it was quite out of the benevolence of her heart that she had asked these young women to her house merely because she thought they deserved some attention were harmless well-behaved girls and would be pleasant companions for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and marianne to be with us while your kind friend there was attending her daughter and now to be so rewarded 'i wish with all my heart ' says poor fanny in her affectionate way 'that we had asked your sisters instead of them ',1,1,0.9954220792851101
i am sorry to say ma'am in a most unhappy rupture -- edward is dismissed for ever from his mother's notice he left her house yesterday but where he is gone or whether he is still in town i do not know for we of course can make no inquiry,1,1,0.8952593335320274
elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards edward though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it,1,1,0.9662995189810593
a few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion concluded his visit and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really believed there was no material danger in fanny's indisposition and that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it he went away leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion as far at least as it regarded mrs ferrars's conduct the dashwoods' and edward's,1,1,0.9921354633627654
nothing new was heard by them for a day or two afterwards of affairs in harley street or bartlett's buildings but though so much of the matter was known to them already that mrs jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther without seeking after more she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual had prevented her going to them within that time,1,1,0.9814929866594349
edward talks of going to oxford soon said she but now he is lodging at no -- pall mall what an ill-natured woman his mother is an't she and your brother and sister were not very kind however i shan't say anything against them to you and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot which was more than i looked for and for my part i was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before but however nothing was said about them and i took care to keep mine out of sight edward have got some business at oxford he says so he must go there for a time and after that as soon as he can light upon a bishop he will be ordained i wonder what curacy he will get -- good gracious giggling as she spoke i'd lay my life i know what my cousins will say when they hear of it they will tell me i should write to the doctor to get edward the curacy of his new living i know they will but i am sure i would not do such a thing for all the world -- 'la ' i shall say directly 'i wonder how you could think of such a thing i write to the doctor indeed ',1,1,0.8514297588269002
oh la here come the richardsons i had a vast deal more to say to you but i must not stay away from them not any longer i assure you they are very genteel people he makes a monstrous deal of money and they keep their own coach i have not time to speak to mrs jennings about it myself but pray tell her i am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us and lady middleton the same and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away and mrs jennings should want company i am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes i suppose lady middleton won't ask us any more this bout good-by i am sorry miss marianne was not here remember me kindly to her la if you have not got your spotted muslin on -- i wonder you was not afraid of its being torn,1,1,0.9503990138618444
such was her parting concern for after this she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to mrs jennings before her company was claimed by mrs richardson and elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind edward's marriage with lucy was as firmly determined on and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain as she had concluded it would be -- every thing depended exactly after her expectation on his getting that preferment of which at present there seemed not the smallest chance,1,1,0.9974713226247953
the next morning brought elinor a letter by the two-penny post from lucy herself it was as follows,1,1,0.9206410576757382
very well indeed -- how prettily she writes -- aye that was quite proper to let him be off if he would that was just like lucy -- poor soul i wish i could get him a living with all my heart -- she calls me dear mrs jennings you see she is a good-hearted girl as ever lived -- very well upon my word that sentence is very prettily turned yes yes i will go and see her sure enough how attentive she is to think of every body -- thank you my dear for shewing it me it is as pretty a letter as ever i saw and does lucy's head and heart great credit,1,1,0.9736898273418704
the miss dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town and marianne's impatience to be gone increased every day she sighed for the air the liberty the quiet of the country and fancied that if any place could give her ease barton must do it elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey which marianne could not be brought to acknowledge she began however seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good-will when a plan was suggested which though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer appeared to elinor altogether much more eligible than any other the palmers were to remove to cleveland about the end of march for the easter holidays and mrs jennings with both her friends received a very warm invitation from charlotte to go with them this would not in itself have been sufficient for the delicacy of miss dashwood -- but it was inforced with so much real politeness by mr palmer himself as joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy induced her to accept it with pleasure,1,1,0.9991639241826902
when she told marianne what she had done however her first reply was not very auspicious,1,1,0.9239332701971033
astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech she was almost ready to cry out lord what should hinder it -- but checking her desire confined herself to this silent ejaculation,1,1,0.6003116990083516
you judged from your knowledge of the colonel's general benevolence but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur,1,1,0.9072374988439474
you mean to go to delaford after them i suppose said elinor with a faint smile,1,1,0.6924519366981036
aye my dear that i do indeed and as to the house being a bad one i do not know what the colonel would be at for it is as good a one as ever i saw,1,1,0.7595957687852057
indeed replied elinor i believe that you will find him on farther acquaintance all that you have heard him to be and as you will be such very near neighbours for i understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house it is particularly important that he should be all this,1,1,0.9191634303710324
when i see him again said elinor to herself as the door shut him out i shall see him the husband of lucy,1,1,0.8073328346944499
when mrs jennings came home though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession than by anything else that she reverted to it again as soon as elinor appeared,1,1,0.9847763743422024
the deception could not continue after this and an explanation immediately took place by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment without any material loss of happiness to either for mrs jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first,1,1,0.9695503448610936
aye aye the parsonage is but a small one said she after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over and very likely may be out of repair but to hear a man apologising as i thought for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor and i think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds -- and to you too that had been used to live in barton cottage -- it seems quite ridiculous but my dear we must touch up the colonel to do some thing to the parsonage and make it comfortable for them before lucy goes to it,1,1,0.8926460404689843
elinor was quite of her opinion as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more,1,1,0.9557630432703872
edward having carried his thanks to colonel brandon proceeded with his happiness to lucy and such was the excess of it by the time he reached bartlett's buildings that she was able to assure mrs jennings who called on her again the next day with her congratulations that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life,1,1,0.9951354172338895
mrs dashwood was denied but before the carriage could turn from the house her husband accidentally came out he expressed great pleasure in meeting elinor told her that he had been just going to call in berkeley street and assuring her that fanny would be very glad to see her invited her to come in,1,1,0.9878254769606316
it is perfectly true -- colonel brandon has given the living of delaford to edward,1,1,0.9581850627519631
really -- well this is very astonishing -- no relationship -- no connection between them -- and now that livings fetch such a price -- what was the value of this,1,1,0.6020127474936494
you surprise me i should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by this time,1,1,0.6307479268526043
the lady i suppose has no choice in the affair,1,1,0.6244567048660754
one other short call in harley street in which elinor received her brother's congratulations on their travelling so far towards barton without any expense and on colonel brandon's being to follow them to cleveland in a day or two completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters in town -- and a faint invitation from fanny to come to norland whenever it should happen to be in their way which of all things was the most unlikely to occur with a more warm though less public assurance from john to elinor of the promptitude with which he should come to see her at delaford was all that foretold any meeting in the country,1,1,0.9905879933805113
marianne few as had been her hours of comfort in london and eager as she had long been to quit it could not when it came to the point bid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those hopes and that confidence in willoughby which were now extinguished for ever without great pain nor could she leave the place in which willoughby remained busy in new engagements and new schemes in which she could have no share without shedding many tears,1,1,0.9677197145696435
marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty miles from barton and not thirty from combe magna and before she had been five minutes within its walls while the others were busily helping charlotte to show her child to the housekeeper she quitted it again stealing away through the winding shrubberies now just beginning to be in beauty to gain a distant eminence where from its grecian temple her eye wandering over a wide tract of country to the south-east could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon and fancy that from their summits combe magna might be seen,1,1,0.7277361892419819
their party was small and the hours passed quietly away mrs palmer had her child and mrs jennings her carpet-work they talked of the friends they had left behind arranged lady middleton's engagements and wondered whether mr palmer and colonel brandon would get farther than reading that night elinor however little concerned in it joined in their discourse and marianne who had the knack of finding her way in every house to the library however it might be avoided by the family in general soon procured herself a book,1,1,0.9966602237827799
he came examined his patient and though encouraging miss dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health yet by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency and allowing the word infection to pass his lips gave instant alarm to mrs palmer on her baby's account mrs jennings who had been inclined from the first to think marianne's complaint more serious than elinor now looked very grave on mr harris's report and confirming charlotte's fears and caution urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant and mr palmer though treating their apprehensions as idle found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood her departure therefore was fixed on and within an hour after mr harris's arrival she set off with her little boy and his nurse for the house of a near relation of mr palmer's who lived a few miles on the other side of bath whither her husband promised at her earnest entreaty to join her in a day or two and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her mrs jennings however with a kindness of heart which made elinor really love her declared her resolution of not stirring from cleveland as long as marianne remained ill and of endeavouring by her own attentive care to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from and elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate desirous to share in all her fatigues and often by her better experience in nursing of material use,1,1,0.9990225670594377
marianne was of course kept in ignorance of all these arrangements she knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of cleveland away in about seven days from the time of their arrival it gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of mrs palmer and as it gave her likewise no concern she never mentioned her name,1,1,0.9780124022789249
elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself and while attempting to soothe her eagerly felt her pulse it was lower and quicker than ever and marianne still talking wildly of mama her alarm increased so rapidly as to determine her on sending instantly for mr harris and despatching a messenger to barton for her mother to consult with colonel brandon on the best means of effecting the latter was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister she hastened down to the drawing-room where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present,1,1,0.9895811599379087
the comfort of such a friend at that moment as colonel brandon -- or such a companion for her mother -- how gratefully was it felt -- a companion whose judgment would guide whose attendance must relieve and whose friendship might soothe her -- as far as the shock of such a summons could be lessened to her his presence his manners his assistance would lessen it,1,1,0.9193211299081858
marianne's ideas were still at intervals fixed incoherently on her mother and whenever she mentioned her name it gave a pang to the heart of poor elinor who reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness and wretched for some immediate relief fancied that all relief might soon be in vain that every thing had been delayed too long and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child or to see her rational,1,1,0.9785897989794354
with strong concern and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid did mrs jennings hear in the morning of what had passed her former apprehensions now with greater reason restored left her no doubt of the event and though trying to speak comfort to elinor her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope her heart was really grieved the rapid decay the early death of a girl so young so lovely as marianne must have struck a less interested person with concern on mrs jennings's compassion she had other claims she had been for three months her companion was still under her care and she was known to have been greatly injured and long unhappy the distress of her sister too particularly a favourite was before her -- and as for their mother when mrs jennings considered that marianne might probably be to her what charlotte was to herself her sympathy in her sufferings was very sincere,1,1,0.9992408517126994
never in her life had elinor found it so difficult to be calm as at that moment the knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door -- of her doubt -- her dread -- perhaps her despair -- and of what she had to tell -- with such knowledge it was impossible to be calm all that remained to be done was to be speedy and therefore staying only till she could leave mrs jennings's maid with her sister she hurried down stairs,1,1,0.9830454313719139
elinor starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room and her hand was already on the lock when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing and saying in a voice rather of command than supplication,1,1,0.5324884464241125
had they told me he cried with vehemence that mr palmer and all his relations were at the devil it would not have turned me from the door my business is with you and only you,1,1,0.6260904954564542
pray be quick sir -- said elinor impatiently -- i have no time to spare,1,1,0.7066172580208906
upon my soul it is -- was his answer with a warmth which brought all the former willoughby to her remembrance and in spite of herself made her think him sincere,1,1,0.9177539093263715
remember cried willoughby from whom you received the account could it be an impartial one i acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me i do not mean to justify myself but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that i have nothing to urge -- that because she was injured she was irreproachable and because i was a libertine she must be a saint if the violence of her passions the weakness of her understanding -- i do not mean however to defend myself her affection for me deserved better treatment and i often with great self-reproach recall the tenderness which for a very short time had the power of creating any return i wish -- i heartily wish it had never been but i have injured more than herself and i have injured one whose affection for me -- may i say it was scarcely less warm than hers and whose mind -- oh how infinitely superior --,1,1,0.9854248779129031
she taxed me with the offence at once and my confusion may be guessed the purity of her life the formality of her notions her ignorance of the world -- every thing was against me the matter itself i could not deny and vain was every endeavour to soften it she was previously disposed i believe to doubt the morality of my conduct in general and was moreover discontented with the very little attention the very little portion of my time that i had bestowed on her in my present visit in short it ended in a total breach by one measure i might have saved myself in the height of her morality good woman she offered to forgive the past if i would marry eliza that could not be -- and i was formally dismissed from her favour and her house the night following this affair -- i was to go the next morning -- was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be the struggle was great -- but it ended too soon my affection for marianne my thorough conviction of her attachment to me -- it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches which i was naturally inclined to feel and expensive society had increased i had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife if i chose to address her and i persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do a heavy scene however awaited me before i could leave devonshire -- i was engaged to dine with you on that very day some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement but whether i should write this apology or deliver it in person was a point of long debate to see marianne i felt would be dreadful and i even doubted whether i could see her again and keep to my resolution in that point however i undervalued my own magnanimity as the event declared for i went i saw her and saw her miserable and left her miserable -- and left her hoping never to see her again,1,1,0.9897893661843998
yes you have certainly removed something -- a little -- you have proved yourself on the whole less faulty than i had believed you you have proved your heart less wicked much less wicked but i hardly know -- the misery that you have inflicted -- i hardly know what could have made it worse,1,1,0.7597018515638744
will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered what i have been telling you -- let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours you tell me that she has forgiven me already let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart and of my present feelings will draw from her a more spontaneous more natural more gentle less dignified forgiveness tell her of my misery and my penitence -- tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her and if you will that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever,1,1,0.8862981513270687
as to that said he i must rub through the world as well as i can domestic happiness is out of the question if however i am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions it may be the means -- it may put me on my guard -- at least it may be something to live for marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever were i even by any blessed chance at liberty again --,1,1,0.7603018574319887
elinor for some time after he left her for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas widely differing in themselves but of which sadness was the general result to think even of her sister,1,1,0.8415693702687118
as soon as mrs dashwood had recovered herself to see marianne was her first desire and in two minutes she was with her beloved child rendered dearer to her than ever by absence unhappiness and danger elinor's delight as she saw what each felt in the meeting was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing marianne of farther sleep -- but mrs dashwood could be calm could be even prudent when the life of a child was at stake and marianne satisfied in knowing her mother was near her and conscious of being too weak for conversation submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her mrs dashwood would sit up with her all night and elinor in compliance with her mother's entreaty went to bed but the rest which one night entirely sleepless and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite was kept off by irritation of spirits willoughby poor willoughby as she now allowed herself to call him was constantly in her thoughts she would not but have heard his vindication for the world and now blamed now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before but her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful she dreaded the performance of it dreaded what its effect on marianne might be doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another and for a moment wished willoughby a widower then remembering colonel brandon reproved herself felt that to his sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival's the reward of her sister was due and wished any thing rather than mrs willoughby's death,1,1,0.9991759249492996
he opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled it came out quite unawares quite undesignedly i you may well believe could talk of nothing but my child -- he could not conceal his distress i saw that it equalled my own and he perhaps thinking that mere friendship as the world now goes would not justify so warm a sympathy -- or rather not thinking at all i suppose -- giving way to irresistible feelings made me acquainted with his earnest tender constant affection for marianne he has loved her my elinor ever since the first moment of seeing her,1,1,0.9599057181478063
colonel brandon's character said elinor as an excellent man is well established,1,1,0.9490969822607764
to judge from the colonel's spirits however you have not yet made him equally sanguine,1,1,0.7957518334405129
she paused -- her daughter could not quite agree with her but her dissent was not heard and therefore gave no offence,1,1,0.8728150633628559
his emotion on entering the room in seeing her altered looks and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him was such as in elinor's conjecture must arise from something more than his affection for marianne or the consciousness of its being known to others and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind brought back by that resemblance between marianne and eliza already acknowledged and now strengthened by the hollow eye the sickly skin the posture of reclining weakness and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation,1,1,0.9761008301257216
the day of separation and departure arrived and marianne after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of mrs jennings one so earnestly grateful so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention and bidding colonel brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend was carefully assisted by him into the carriage of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half mrs dashwood and elinor then followed and the others were left by themselves to talk of the travellers and feel their own dullness till mrs jennings was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young companions and colonel brandon immediately afterwards took his solitary way to delaford,1,1,0.9972066053373234
how then asked her sister would you account for his behaviour,1,1,0.8563831976699731
i am not wishing him too much good said marianne at last with a sigh when i wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own he will suffer enough in them,1,1,0.9330002982119615
marianne assented most feelingly to the remark and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of colonel brandon's injuries and merits warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate her daughter did not look however as if much of it were heard by her,1,1,0.9612664330017368
margaret returned and the family were again all restored to each other again quietly settled at the cottage and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to barton at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future,1,1,0.8813642106299249
their man-servant had been sent one morning to exeter on business and when as he waited at table he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand this was his voluntary communication --,1,1,0.8834888744675403
marianne gave a violent start fixed her eyes upon elinor saw her turning pale and fell back in her chair in hysterics mrs dashwood whose eyes as she answered the servant's inquiry had intuitively taken the same direction was shocked to perceive by elinor's countenance how much she really suffered and a moment afterwards alike distressed by marianne's situation knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention,1,1,0.9845266581371277
who told you that mr ferrars was married thomas,1,1,0.9376000991745805
mrs dashwood now looked at her daughter but elinor knew better than to expect them she recognised the whole of lucy in the message and was very confident that edward would never come near them she observed in a low voice to her mother that they were probably going down to mr pratt's near plymouth,1,1,0.9854448355947424
when the dessert and the wine were arranged and mrs dashwood and elinor were left by themselves they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence mrs dashwood feared to hazard any remark and ventured not to offer consolation she now found that she had erred in relying on elinor's representation of herself and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time to spare her from an increase of unhappiness suffering as she then had suffered for marianne she found that she had been misled by the careful the considerate attention of her daughter to think the attachment which once she had so well understood much slighter in reality than she had been wont to believe or than it was now proved to be she feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust inattentive nay almost unkind to her elinor -- that marianne's affliction because more acknowledged more immediately before her had too much engrossed her tenderness and led her away to forget that in elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much certainly with less self-provocation and greater fortitude,1,1,0.9983224056412048
i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to hear from him again i earnestly pressed his coming to us and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow or any day,1,1,0.726597647108843
his countenance as he entered the room was not too happy even for elinor his complexion was white with agitation and he looked as if fearful of his reception and conscious that he merited no kind one mrs dashwood however conforming as she trusted to the wishes of that daughter by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing met with a look of forced complacency gave him her hand and wished him joy,1,1,0.9819170599362321
when elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season a very awful pause took place it was put an end to by mrs dashwood who felt obliged to hope that he had left mrs ferrars very well in a hurried manner he replied in the affirmative,1,1,0.9716497386253438
elinor resolving to exert herself though fearing the sound of her own voice now said,1,1,0.8610933840150051
she dared not look up -- but her mother and marianne both turned their eyes on him he coloured seemed perplexed looked doubtingly and after some hesitation said --,1,1,0.7818583183601033
perhaps you mean -- my brother -- you mean mrs -- mrs robert ferrars,1,1,0.9401483718127776
his heart was now open to elinor all its weaknesses all its errors confessed and his first boyish attachment to lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four,1,1,0.7754712379709783
your sincere well-wisher friend and sister lucy ferrars,1,1,0.92664128294088
i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition said edward -- for worlds would not i have had a letter of hers seen by you in former days -- in a sister it is bad enough but in a wife -- how i have blushed over the pages of her writing -- and i believe i may say that since the first half year of our foolish -- business -- this is the only letter i ever received from her of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style,1,1,0.952336254330791
edward was of course immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than lucy's conduct nor more self-evident than the motive of it,1,1,0.9768188694233051
he could only plead an ignorance of his own heart and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement,1,1,0.7956535134617958
now he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place but so little interest had be taken in the matter that he owed all his knowledge of the house garden and glebe extent of the parish condition of the land and rate of the tithes to elinor herself who had heard so much of it from colonel brandon and heard it with so much attention as to be entirely mistress of the subject,1,1,0.9271103840297469
a letter of proper submission repeated he would they have me beg my mother's pardon for robert's ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me -- i can make no submission -- i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed -- i am grown very happy but that would not interest -- i know of no submission that is proper for me to make,1,1,0.8100908451015417
in spite of his being allowed once more to live however he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure till he had revealed his present engagement for the publication of that circumstance he feared might give a sudden turn to his constitution and carry him off as rapidly as before with apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed and he was listened to with unexpected calmness mrs ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying miss dashwood by every argument in her power -- told him that in miss morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune -- and enforced the assertion by observing that miss morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds while miss dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than three but when she found that though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation he was by no means inclined to be guided by it she judged it wisest from the experience of the past to submit -- and therefore after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of edward and elinor,1,1,0.9962710661320644
the whole of lucy's behaviour in the affair and the prosperity which crowned it therefore may be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest an unceasing attention to self-interest however its progress may be apparently obstructed will do in securing every advantage of fortune with no other sacrifice than that of time and conscience when robert first sought her acquaintance and privately visited her in bartlett's buildings it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother he merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter in that point however and that only he erred -- for though lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in time another visit another conversation was always wanted to produce this conviction some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted which could only be removed by another half hour's discourse with himself his attendance was by this means secured and the rest followed in course instead of talking of edward they came gradually to talk only of robert -- a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own and in short it became speedily evident to both that he had entirely supplanted his brother he was proud of his conquest proud of tricking edward and very proud of marrying privately without his mother's consent what immediately followed is known they passed some months in great happiness at dawlish for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut -- and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages -- and from thence returning to town procured the forgiveness of mrs ferrars by the simple expedient of asking it which at lucy's instigation was adopted the forgiveness at first indeed as was reasonable comprehended only robert and lucy who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none still remained some weeks longer unpardoned but perseverance in humility of conduct and messages in self-condemnation for robert's offence and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness and led soon afterwards by rapid degrees to the highest state of affection and influence lucy became as necessary to mrs ferrars as either robert or fanny and while edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her and elinor though superior to her in fortune and birth was spoken of as an intruder she was in every thing considered and always openly acknowledged to be a favourite child they settled in town received very liberal assistance from mrs ferrars were on the best terms imaginable with the dashwoods and setting aside the jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between fanny and lucy in which their husbands of course took a part as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between robert and lucy themselves nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together,1,1,0.9996242582783608
elinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived without rendering the cottage at barton entirely useless for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her mrs dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at delaford for her wish of bringing marianne and colonel brandon together was hardly less earnest though rather more liberal than what john had expressed it was now her darling object precious as was the company of her daughter to her she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend and to see marianne settled at the mansion-house was equally the wish of edward and elinor they each felt his sorrows and their own obligations and marianne by general consent was to be the reward of all,1,1,0.9989736723468282
willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of mrs smith who by stating his marriage with a woman of character as the source of her clemency gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards marianne he might at once have been happy and rich that his repentance of misconduct which thus brought its own punishment was sincere need not be doubted -- nor that he long thought of colonel brandon with envy and of marianne with regret but that he was for ever inconsolable that he fled from society or contracted an habitual gloom of temper or died of a broken heart must not be depended on -- for he did neither he lived to exert and frequently to enjoy himself his wife was not always out of humour nor his home always uncomfortable and in his breed of horses and dogs and in sporting of every kind he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity,1,1,0.9836967588540529
between barton and delaford there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate -- and among the merits and the happiness of elinor and marianne let it not be ranked as the least considerable that though sisters and living almost within sight of each other they could live without disagreement between themselves or producing coolness between their husbands,1,1,0.9562818084523653

suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted,0,0,0.09516763865170605
alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rat-hole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway 'and even if my head would go through ' thought poor alice 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only know how to begin ' for you see so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible,0,0,0.07359736367244064

after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came 'oh the duchess the duchess oh won't she be savage if i've kept her waiting ' alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice 'if you please sir -- ' the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go,0,0,0.02078443809048652
'would it be of any use now ' thought alice 'to speak to this mouse everything is so out-of-the-way down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate there's no harm in trying ' so she began 'o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse ' alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brother's latin grammar 'a mouse -- of a mouse -- to a mouse -- a mouse -- o mouse ' the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing,0,0,0.15260350953044458

they had not touched each other twice however when upon the hill above the crucifix there appeared another horrible parody of its shape the figure of a man who appeared for an instant waving his outspread arms he had vanished in an instant but macian whose fighting face was set that way had seen the shape momentarily but quite photographically and while it was like a comic repetition of the cross it was also in that place and hour something more incredible it had been only instantaneously on the retina of his eye but unless his eye and mind were going mad together the figure was that of an ordinary london policeman,0,0,0.028279454480153843

mr todhunter explained father brown placidly is learning to be a professional conjurer as well as juggler ventriloquist and expert in the rope trick the conjuring explains the hat it is without traces of hair not because it is worn by the prematurely bald mr glass but because it has never been worn by anybody the juggling explains the three glasses which todhunter was teaching himself to throw up and catch in rotation but being only at the stage of practice he smashed one glass against the ceiling and the juggling also explains the sword which it was mr todhunter's professional pride and duty to swallow but again being at the stage of practice he very slightly grazed the inside of his throat with the weapon hence he has a wound inside him which i am sure from the expression on his face is not a serious one he was also practising the trick of a release from ropes like the davenport brothers and he was just about to free himself when we all burst into the room the cards of course are for card tricks and they are scattered on the floor because he had just been practising one of those dodges of sending them flying through the air he merely kept his trade secret because he had to keep his tricks secret like any other conjurer but the mere fact of an idler in a top hat having once looked in at his back window and been driven away by him with great indignation was enough to set us all on a wrong track of romance and make us imagine his whole life overshadowed by the silk-hatted spectre of mr glass,0,0,0.03629209423174789

all these trivialities brown heard and saw but heard them as a tired man hears a tune in the railway wheels or saw them as a sick man sees the pattern of his wall-paper no one can calculate the turns of mood in convalescence but father brown's depression must have had a great deal to do with his mere unfamiliarity with the sea for as the river mouth narrowed like the neck of a bottle and the water grew calmer and the air warmer and more earthly he seemed to wake up and take notice like a baby they had reached that phase just after sunset when air and water both look bright but earth and all its growing things look almost black by comparison about this particular evening however there was something exceptional it was one of those rare atmospheres in which a smoked-glass slide seems to have been slid away from between us and nature so that even dark colours on that day look more gorgeous than bright colours on cloudier days the trampled earth of the river-banks and the peaty stain in the pools did not look drab but glowing umber and the dark woods astir in the breeze did not look as usual dim blue with mere depth of distance but more like wind-tumbled masses of some vivid violet blossom this magic clearness and intensity in the colours was further forced on brown's slowly reviving senses by something romantic and even secret in the very form of the landscape,0,0,0.009862119755329643

oh there's a strange story about that too said the young squire with relish you are really in a land of strange stories king arthur was here and merlin and the fairies before him the story goes that sir peter pendragon who i fear had some of the faults of the pirates as well as the virtues of the sailor was bringing home three spanish gentlemen in honourable captivity intending to escort them to elizabeth's court but he was a man of flaming and tigerish temper and coming to high words with one of them he caught him by the throat and flung him by accident or design into the sea a second spaniard who was the brother of the first instantly drew his sword and flew at pendragon and after a short but furious combat in which both got three wounds in as many minutes pendragon drove his blade through the other's body and the second spaniard was accounted for as it happened the ship had already turned into the river mouth and was close to comparatively shallow water the third spaniard sprang over the side of the ship struck out for the shore and was soon near enough to it to stand up to his waist in water and turning again to face the ship and holding up both arms to heaven -- like a prophet calling plagues upon a wicked city -- he called out to pendragon in a piercing and terrible voice that he at least was yet living that he would go on living that he would live for ever and that generation after generation the house of pendragon should never see him or his but should know by very certain signs that he and his vengeance were alive with that he dived under the wave and was either drowned or swam so long under water that no hair of his head was seen afterwards,0,0,0.015397306624009828
never mind girls said fanshaw impatiently there are plenty of them in the world but not many things like the pendragon tower as you may easily suppose plenty of superstitions and scandals have followed in the track of the spaniard's curse and no doubt as you would put it any accident happening to this cornish family would be connected with it by rural credulity but it is perfectly true that this tower has been burnt down two or three times and the family can't be called lucky for more than two i think of the admiral's near kin have perished by shipwreck and one at least to my own knowledge on practically the same spot where sir peter threw the spaniard overboard,0,0,0.28015445882734435

in that place they dined and slept both very thoroughly the beans and bacon which these unaccountable people cooked well the astonishing emergence of burgundy from their cellars crowned syme's sense of a new comradeship and comfort through all this ordeal his root horror had been isolation and there are no words to express the abyss between isolation and having one ally it may be conceded to the mathematicians that four is twice two but two is not twice one two is two thousand times one that is why in spite of a hundred disadvantages the world will always return to monogamy,0,0,0.42260289178528715

i need hardly say there was a collision the pessimists all round me looked anxiously from one professor to the other professor to see which was really the more feeble but i won an old man in poor health like my rival could not be expected to be so impressively feeble as a young actor in the prime of life you see he really had paralysis and working within this definite limitation he couldn't be so jolly paralytic as i was then he tried to blast my claims intellectually i countered that by a very simple dodge whenever he said something that nobody but he could understand i replied with something which i could not even understand myself 'i don't fancy ' he said 'that you could have worked out the principle that evolution is only negation since there inheres in it the introduction of lacuna which are an essential of differentiation ' i replied quite scornfully 'you read all that up in pinckwerts the notion that involution functioned eugenically was exposed long ago by glumpe ' it is unnecessary for me to say that there never were such people as pinckwerts and glumpe but the people all round rather to my surprise seemed to remember them quite well and the professor finding that the learned and mysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy slightly deficient in scruples fell back upon a more popular form of wit 'i see ' he sneered 'you prevail like the false pig in aesop ' 'and you fail ' i answered smiling 'like the hedgehog in montaigne ' need i say that there is no hedgehog in montaigne 'your claptrap comes off ' he said 'so would your beard ' i had no intelligent answer to this which was quite true and rather witty but i laughed heartily answered 'like the pantheist's boots ' at random and turned on my heel with all the honours of victory the real professor was thrown out but not with violence though one man tried very patiently to pull off his nose he is now i believe received everywhere in europe as a delightful impostor his apparent earnestness and anger you see make him all the more entertaining,0,0,0.10718290415049617
you must excuse my manner said the professor dismally my position is rather a curious one inside i am really bursting with boyish merriment but i acted the paralytic professor so well that now i can't leave off so that when i am among friends and have no need at all to disguise myself i still can't help speaking slow and wrinkling my forehead -- just as if it were my forehead i can be quite happy you understand but only in a paralytic sort of way the most buoyant exclamations leap up in my heart but they come out of my mouth quite different you should hear me say 'buck up old cock ' it would bring tears to your eyes,0,0,0.0782460187256833

syme stood staring back at the stiff face like parchment and the blank blue eyes his first thought was that the professor had gone mad but his second thought was more frightful after all what did he know about this queer creature whom he had heedlessly accepted as a friend what did he know except that the man had been at the anarchist breakfast and had told him a ridiculous tale how improbable it was that there should be another friend there beside gogol was this man's silence a sensational way of declaring war was this adamantine stare after all only the awful sneer of some threefold traitor who had turned for the last time he stood and strained his ears in this heartless silence he almost fancied he could hear dynamiters come to capture him shifting softly in the corridor outside,0,0,0.012853796921265696

the quiet good humour of his manner left his two opponents helpless it was with some momentary difficulty that the professor broke silence and began i'm sorry to disturb you so early comrade said he with a careful resumption of the slow de worms manner you have no doubt made all the arrangements for the paris affair then he added with infinite slowness we have information which renders intolerable anything in the nature of a moment's delay,0,0,0.23369947511617353
please do not think me excessively abrupt but i advise you to alter those plans or if it is too late for that to follow your agent with all the support you can get for him comrade syme and i have had an experience which it would take more time to recount than we can afford if we are to act on it i will however relate the occurrence in detail even at the risk of losing time if you really feel that it is essential to the understanding of the problem we have to discuss,0,0,0.40488802985841355

yes the thing really happened to me he said hastily i had the good fortune to fall into conversation with a detective who took me thanks to my hat for a respectable person wishing to clinch my reputation for respectability i took him and made him very drunk at the savoy under this influence he became friendly and told me in so many words that within a day or two they hope to arrest the marquis in france,0,0,0.27251619462553356

all this time syme had been staring at the doctor almost as steadily as the doctor stared at the professor but quite without the smile the nerves of both comrades-in-arms were near snapping under that strain of motionless amiability when syme suddenly leant forward and idly tapped the edge of the table his message to his ally ran i have an intuition,0,0,0.00810691622213478

their new ally was in practical matters a whirlwind at the inquiry office he asked with businesslike brevity about the trains for dover having got his information he bundled the company into a cab and put them and himself inside a railway carriage before they had properly realised the breathless process they were already on the calais boat before conversation flowed freely,0,0,0.17512394036803272
i had already arranged he explained to go to france for my lunch but i am delighted to have someone to lunch with me you see i had to send that beast the marquis over with his bomb because the president had his eye on me though god knows how i'll tell you the story some day it was perfectly choking whenever i tried to slip out of it i saw the president somewhere smiling out of the bow-window of a club or taking off his hat to me from the top of an omnibus i tell you you can say what you like that fellow sold himself to the devil he can be in six places at once,0,0,0.029294544841146054

it only remains continued syme quite unperturbed to adopt some other method of breaking the ice if i may so express it between myself and the man i wish to kill and since the course of a dialogue cannot be predicted by one of its parties alone as you have pointed out with such recondite acumen the only thing to be done i suppose is for the one party as far as possible to do all the dialogue by himself and so i will by george and he stood up suddenly his yellow hair blowing in the slight sea breeze,0,0,0.20253449608182783

gentlemen he said we all owe you a serious apology but i assure you that you have not been made the victims of such a low joke as you imagine or indeed of anything undignified in a man of honour you have not wasted your time you have helped to save the world we are not buffoons but very desperate men at war with a vast conspiracy a secret society of anarchists is hunting us like hares not such unfortunate madmen as may here or there throw a bomb through starvation or german philosophy but a rich and powerful and fanatical church a church of eastern pessimism which holds it holy to destroy mankind like vermin how hard they hunt us you can gather from the fact that we are driven to such disguises as those for which i apologise and to such pranks as this one by which you suffer,0,0,0.1126371160719762

of course i accept the apology but you will in your turn forgive me if i decline to follow you further into your difficulties and permit myself to say good morning the sight of an acquaintance and distinguished fellow-townsman coming to pieces in the open air is unusual and upon the whole sufficient for one day colonel ducroix i would in no way influence your actions but if you feel with me that our present society is a little abnormal i am now going to walk back to the town,0,0,0.4506404793515585

mere mobs repeated his new friend with a snort of scorn so you talk about mobs and the working classes as if they were the question you've got that eternal idiotic idea that if anarchy came it would come from the poor why should it the poor have been rebels but they have never been anarchists they have more interest than anyone else in there being some decent government the poor man really has a stake in the country the rich man hasn't he can go away to new guinea in a yacht the poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly the rich have always objected to being governed at all aristocrats were always anarchists as you can see from the barons' wars,0,0,0.20018194545630263

dr renard was a mild man with monstrous wealth his rooms were like the musee de cluny and he had three motor-cars these however he seemed to use very sparingly having the simple tastes of the french middle class and when his impatient friends came to examine them it took them some time to assure themselves that one of them even could be made to work this with some difficulty they brought round into the street before the doctor's house when they came out of the dim garage they were startled to find that twilight had already fallen with the abruptness of night in the tropics either they had been longer in the place than they imagined or some unusual canopy of cloud had gathered over the town they looked down the steep streets and seemed to see a slight mist coming up from the sea,0,0,0.08491711535570826
