how was she to bear the change -- it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs weston only half a mile from them and a miss taylor in the house and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude she dearly loved her father but he was no companion for her he could not meet her in conversation rational or playful,1,1,0.9755343679488425
the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mr woodhouse had not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity of mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him at any time,1,1,0.9425700041359366
how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see us -- we shall be always meeting we must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon,1,1,0.7340548670849729
no papa nobody thought of your walking we must go in the carriage to be sure,1,1,0.8766560551604458
by the bye -- i have not wished you joy being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well how did you all behave who cried most,1,1,0.8285623003549396
especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature said emma playfully that is what you have in your head i know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by,1,1,0.706982226230896
i believe it is very true my dear indeed said mr woodhouse with a sigh i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome,1,1,0.9064970965794901
dear emma bears every thing so well said her father but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for,1,1,0.9949568847731604
ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell's i made up my mind on the subject i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave off match-making,1,1,0.893005918446343
with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time said mr knightley laughing and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife depend upon it a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself,1,1,0.9399996352270857
it was indeed a highly prized letter mrs weston had of course formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured she felt herself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled and who could ill bear to part with her,1,1,0.9946438248784969
as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day a note was brought from mrs goddard requesting in most respectful terms to be allowed to bring miss smith with her a most welcome request for miss smith was a girl of seventeen whom emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in on account of her beauty a very gracious invitation was returned and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion,1,1,0.989709736471791
harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody somebody had placed her several years back at mrs goddard's school and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder this was all that was generally known of her history she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her,1,1,0.9704754047843839
emma allowed her father to talk -- but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening and actually shaken hands with her at last,1,1,0.9966576240058898
and when she had come away mrs martin was so very kind as to send mrs goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose mrs goddard had ever seen mrs goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all the three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson to sup with her,1,1,0.938277226642172
i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man i know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well what do you imagine his age to be,1,1,0.8258223403477184
he was four-and-twenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference -- which is very odd,1,1,0.6424889931127767
only four-and-twenty that is too young to settle his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry they seem very comfortable as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably repent it six years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very desirable,1,1,0.8562931139422654
you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i would have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse i want to see you permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say that if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere farmer's daughter without education,1,1,0.984944007605399
emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech and saw no alarming symptoms of love the young man had been the first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold and that there would be no serious difficulty on harriet's side to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own,1,1,0.9236335334160853
mr knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr martin with him you might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in mr knightley but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to what say you to mr weston and mr elton compare mr martin with either of them compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent you must see the difference,1,1,0.978743464675629
oh yes -- there is a great difference but mr weston is almost an old man mr weston must be between forty and fifty,1,1,0.889720896356768
there is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly,1,1,0.7375036343981306
i wonder he did not remember the book -- was all harriet's answer and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be safely left to itself she therefore said no more for some time her next beginning was,1,1,0.941358541029294
in one respect perhaps mr elton's manners are superior to mr knightley's or mr weston's they have more gentleness they might be more safely held up as a pattern there is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body likes in him because there is so much good-humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied neither would mr knightley's downright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits him very well his figure and look and situation in life seem to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him he would not be sufferable on the contrary i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr elton as a model mr elton is good-humoured cheerful obliging and gentle he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be if he means any thing it must be to please you did not i tell you what he said of you the other day,1,1,0.9913471063903267
i think they will neither of them do the other any good,1,1,0.5802081048965136
mr weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject we were speaking of it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with mr knightley i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case you are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value of a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used to it all her life i can imagine your objection to harriet smith she is not the superior young woman which emma's friend ought to be but on the other hand as emma wants to see her better informed it will be an inducement to her to read more herself they will read together she means it i know,1,1,0.9960722340101578
yes said he smiling you are better placed here very fit for a wife but not at all for a governess but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from her on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor,1,1,0.9628209384651524
thank you there will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as mr weston,1,1,0.9157998354424497
i hope not that -- it is not likely no mr knightley do not foretell vexation from that quarter,1,1,0.9431421508672028
oh you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you very well i shall not attempt to deny emma's being pretty,1,1,0.9287105533126788
such an eye -- the true hazle eye -- and so brilliant regular features open countenance with a complexion oh what a bloom of full health and such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure there is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head her glance one hears sometimes of a child being the picture of health ' now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health she is loveliness itself mr knightley is not she,1,1,0.8184920981951893
exactly so that is what principally strikes me so much superadded decision of character skilful has been the hand,1,1,0.62536486277581
harriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say with a very interesting naivete,1,1,0.8146044996318652
exactly so -- the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- i have not a doubt of your success pray pray attempt it as you will do it it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession,1,0,0.3903416640790197
but i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit she thinks so little of her own beauty did not you observe her manner of answering me how completely it meant why should my picture be drawn ',1,1,0.9689084144246131
mr elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea and was repeating no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed as you observe exactly so no husbands and wives with so interesting a consciousness that emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once but as she wanted to be drawing the declaration must wait a little longer,1,1,0.9633241785973011
harriet was to sit again the next day and mr elton just as he ought entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again,1,1,0.9027316150635865
emma knew that she had but would not own it and mr elton warmly added,1,1,0.9872245662731708
upon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking he will connect himself well if he can,1,1,0.6362631039470142
yes indeed a very good letter replied emma rather slowly -- so good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of his sisters must have helped him i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise not diffuse enough for a woman no doubt he is a sensible man and i suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find proper words it is so with some men yes i understand the sort of mind vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point not coarse a better written letter harriet returning it than i had expected,1,1,0.9604767728026065
oh no no the letter had much better be all your own you will express yourself very properly i am sure there is no danger of your not being intelligible which is the first thing your meaning must be unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires will present themselves unbidden to your mind i am persuaded you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment,1,1,0.9687130220325314
ought to refuse him my dear harriet what do you mean are you in any doubt as to that i thought -- but i beg your pardon perhaps i have been under a mistake i certainly have been misunderstanding you if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it,1,1,0.7880313448399182
you mean to return a favourable answer i collect,1,1,0.5958209363610568
i shall not give you any advice harriet i will have nothing to do with it this is a point which you must settle with your feelings,1,1,0.8940292183690755
i had no notion that he liked me so very much said harriet contemplating the letter for a little while emma persevered in her silence but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say,1,1,0.9366144515363726
oh no i am sure you are a great deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me what i had best do -- no no i do not mean that -- as you say one's mind ought to be quite made up -- one should not be hesitating -- it is a very serious thing -- it will be safer to say no ' perhaps -- do you think i had better say no ',1,1,0.7985668297929317
not for the world said emma smiling graciously would i advise you either way you must be the best judge of your own happiness if you prefer mr martin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate you blush harriet -- does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition harriet harriet do not deceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion at this moment whom are you thinking of,1,1,0.9842815489336125
miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse mr martin do you think i am right,1,1,0.9559597268659906
harriet had not surmised her own danger but the idea of it struck her forcibly,1,1,0.8776841869873816
indeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you but it must have been you would have thrown yourself out of all good society i must have given you up,1,1,0.8799708965451714
dear me -- how should i ever have borne it it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more,1,1,0.7439642007405961
i do not think he is conceited either in general said harriet her conscience opposing such censure at least he is very good natured and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know though he may like me it does not follow that i should -- and certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all one is so very handsome and agreeable however i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but as to leaving you it is what i would not do upon any consideration,1,1,0.9880038383826856
thank you thank you my own sweet little friend we will not be parted a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked or because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter,1,1,0.7664255651344638
emma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a very true and it would be a small consolation to her for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day to know that her husband could write a good letter,1,1,0.9529988893685511
i shall never be invited to abbey-mill again was said in rather a sorrowful tone,1,1,0.7500902142227537
has he so -- then i know nothing of mr elton no my dear little modest harriet depend upon it the picture will not be in bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow it is his companion all this evening his solace his delight it opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature eager curiosity and warm prepossession how cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy their imaginations all are,1,1,0.9299010942859679
well i believe if you will excuse me mr knightley if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing i shall take emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour as the sun is out i believe i had better take my three turns while i can i treat you without ceremony mr knightley we invalids think we are privileged people,1,1,0.8356389775760016
i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter emma will be happy to entertain you and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk,1,1,0.7909276770872263
thank you i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may you do not often overpower me with it,1,1,0.789381162983551
something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps,1,1,0.7426378676891977
a very serious sort i assure you still smiling,1,1,0.6587766187364832
very serious i can think of but one thing -- who is in love with her who makes you their confidant,1,1,0.5129468945740876
well well means to make her an offer then will that do he came to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and i believe considers me as one of his best friends he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early whether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered especially since your making so much of her as in a line of society above him i was very much pleased with all that he said i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very well judging he told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage he is an excellent young man both as son and brother i had no hesitation in advising him to marry he proved to me that he could afford it and that being the case i was convinced he could not do better i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy if he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought highly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had this happened the night before last now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs goddard's to-day and she may be detained by a visitor without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch,1,1,0.9913954568236372
certainly replied he surprized i do not absolutely know it but it may be inferred was not she the whole day with you,1,1,0.8267300674422108
this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed and mr knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure as he stood up in tall indignation and said,1,1,0.8316322223990601
then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her what is the foolish girl about,1,1,0.6448479959775822
nonsense a man does not imagine any such thing but what is the meaning of this harriet smith refuse robert martin madness if it is so but i hope you are mistaken,1,1,0.9644253806540832
and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should not feel that i had done wrong mr martin is a very respectable young man but i cannot admit him to be harriet's equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her by your account he does seem to have had some scruples it is a pity that they were ever got over,1,1,0.9709293822198771
we think so very differently on this point mr knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it we shall only be making each other more angry but as to my letting her marry robert martin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any second application she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him he was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at abbey-mill find him disagreeable but the case is altered now she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet,1,1,0.9921587473424384
emma made no answer and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone she did not repent what she had done she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general which made her dislike having it so loudly against her and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state was very disagreeable some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence with only one attempt on emma's side to talk of the weather but he made no answer he was thinking the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words,1,1,0.9599691115489889
i am very much obliged to you said emma laughing again if i had set my heart on mr elton's marrying harriet it would have been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself i have done with match-making indeed i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls i shall leave off while i am well,1,1,0.9904735143014837
my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings lords of the earth their luxury and ease another view of man my second brings behold him there the monarch of the seas,1,0,0.14472221094320048
but ah united what reverse we have man's boasted power and freedom all are flown lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave and woman lovely woman reigns alone,1,0,0.25113777248132
harriet exactly soft is the very word for her eye -- of all epithets the justest that could be given,1,1,0.8150234808987885
she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length by the eagerness of harriet's wondering questions,1,1,0.8069514369991087
there is so pointed and so particular a meaning in this compliment said she that i cannot have a doubt as to mr elton's intentions you are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it i thought it must be so i thought i could not be so deceived but now it is clear the state of his mind is as clear and decided as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you yes harriet just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened i could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr elton were most desirable or most natural its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other i am very happy i congratulate you my dear harriet with all my heart this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating this is a connexion which offers nothing but good it will give you every thing that you want -- consideration independence a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends close to hartfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever this harriet is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us,1,1,0.9944738618548771
it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected i am sure a month ago i had no more idea myself -- the strangest things do take place,1,1,0.7221119935170268
when miss smiths and mr eltons get acquainted -- they do indeed -- and really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is so evidently so palpably desirable -- what courts the pre-arrangement of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form you and mr elton are by situation called together you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow,1,1,0.9374181531719462
i do think it is without exception the best charade i ever read,1,1,0.6781829854991321
leave it to me you do nothing he will be here this evening i dare say and then i will give it him back and some nonsense or other will pass between us and you shall not be committed -- your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming trust to me,1,0,0.35280218986313583
oh no -- i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it do as you please,1,1,0.593687103169768
mr woodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of well my dears how does your book go on -- have you got any thing fresh,1,1,0.8456944482034319
she read it to him just as he liked to have any thing read slowly and distinctly and two or three times over with explanations of every part as she proceeded -- and he was very much pleased and as she had foreseen especially struck with the complimentary conclusion,1,1,0.7722904005284068
oh yes -- she will have her own room of course the room she always has -- and there is the nursery for the children -- just as usual you know why should there be any change,1,1,0.7869487166904723
i do not know my dear -- but it is so long since she was here -- not since last easter and then only for a few days -- mr john knightley's being a lawyer is very inconvenient -- poor isabella -- she is sadly taken away from us all -- and how sorry she will be when she comes not to see miss taylor here,1,1,0.9624015449613486
we must ask mr and mrs weston to dine with us while isabella is here,1,1,0.96590293560562
this was too true for contradiction unwelcome as it was mr woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh and as emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them,1,1,0.9778613925441684
emma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account her father was sure of his rubber he re-urged -- she re-declined and he seemed then about to make his bow when taking the paper from the table she returned it --,1,1,0.7899593961161262
oh here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us thank you for the sight of it we admired it so much that i have ventured to write it into miss smith's collection your friend will not take it amiss i hope of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines,1,1,0.9215204992464404
their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane a lane leading at right angles from the broad though irregular main street of the place and as may be inferred containing the blessed abode of mr elton a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed and then about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage an old and not very good house almost as close to the road as it could be it had no advantage of situation but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor and such as it was there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes -- emma's remark was --,1,1,0.7830376536694503
harriet she found had never in her life been within side the vicarage and her curiosity to see it was so extreme that considering exteriors and probabilities emma could only class it as a proof of love with mr elton's seeing ready wit in her,1,1,0.9827587916913081
but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates,1,1,0.8053373326432967
that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i thought i should ever be like miss bates so silly -- so satisfied -- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious -- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me i would marry to-morrow but between us i am convinced there never can be any likeness except in being unmarried,1,1,0.9468624853010906
oh yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury by the bye that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece heaven forbid at least that i should ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together as she does about jane fairfax one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax every letter from her is read forty times over her compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month i wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death,1,1,0.9652185755533355
and really i do not think the impression will soon be over said emma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep which ended the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden and brought them into the lane again i do not think it will stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place and recall the still greater within,1,1,0.5123184570368613
mr john knightley was a tall gentleman-like and very clever man rising in his profession domestic and respectable in his private character but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing and capable of being sometimes out of humour he was not an ill-tempered man not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach but his temper was not his great perfection and indeed with such a worshipping wife it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted and he could sometimes act an ungracious or say a severe thing,1,1,0.9828237570083571
very much to the honour of both was the handsome reply,1,1,0.7491091092049335
and do you see her sir tolerably often asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father,1,1,0.790270798028895
oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here -- and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated -- which is the exact truth,1,1,0.9967482372879312
me my love cried his wife hearing and understanding only in part -- are you talking about me -- i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall never forget his flying henry's kite for him that very windy day last easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o'clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence -- if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor,1,1,0.9914728970998393
how very pleasing and proper of him cried the good-hearted mrs john knightley i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him to give up one's child i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else,1,1,0.9867189343713231
mr knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of mr woodhouse who did not like that any one should share with him in isabella's first day emma's sense of right however had decided it and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother she had particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late disagreement between mr knightley and herself in procuring him the proper invitation,1,1,0.9960183043791808
she hoped they might now become friends again she thought it was time to make up making-up indeed would not do she certainly had not been in the wrong and he would never own that he had concession must be out of the question but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngest a nice little girl about eight months old who was now making her first visit to hartfield and very happy to be danced about in her aunt's arms it did assist for though he began with grave looks and short questions he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity emma felt they were friends again and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction and then a little sauciness she could not help saying as he was admiring the baby,1,1,0.9584419390939317
this had just taken place and with great cordiality when john knightley made his appearance and how d'ye do george and john how are you succeeded in the true english style burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference the real attachment which would have led either of them if requisite to do every thing for the good of the other,1,1,0.868950122288434
my poor dear isabella said he fondly taking her hand and interrupting for a few moments her busy labours for some one of her five children -- how long it is how terribly long since you were here and how tired you must be after your journey you must go to bed early my dear -- and i recommend a little gruel to you before you go -- you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together my dear emma suppose we all have a little gruel,1,1,0.899684909086377
it was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn at south end instead of coming here i never had much opinion of the sea air,1,1,0.6179857424310736
why pretty well but not quite well poor perry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere but then there is not so clever a man any where,1,1,0.7078262171943701
oh the good bateses -- i am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters i hope they are quite well good old mrs bates -- i will call upon her to-morrow and take my children -- they are always so pleased to see my children -- and that excellent miss bates -- such thorough worthy people -- how are they sir,1,1,0.9408883339126276
how sorry i am but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn mr wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy -- except when it has been quite an influenza,1,1,0.7924878280916688
ah my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always a sickly season nobody is healthy in london nobody can be it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there so far off -- and the air so bad,1,1,0.7116114559454304
my dear isabella -- exclaimed he hastily -- pray do not concern yourself about my looks be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children and let me look as i chuse,1,1,0.8552222684142697
i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother cried emma about your friend mr graham's intending to have a bailiff from scotland to look after his new estate what will it answer will not the old prejudice be too strong,1,1,0.6969560538522467
our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty kind of young person you will like harriet emma could not have a better companion than harriet,1,1,0.9883816217371477
i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn instead of coming here,1,0,0.38242878906215566
but why should you be sorry sir -- i assure you it did the children a great deal of good,1,1,0.7956220380892117
but my dear sir the difference of the journey -- only consider how great it would have been -- an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty,1,1,0.7612687240789021
emma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs goddard's experience and care but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away which she would rather feed and assist than not she added soon afterwards -- as if quite another subject,1,1,0.9813142053563176
mr elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make which was exactly the case for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady and not liking to resist any advice of her's he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit -- but emma too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially or see him with clear vision was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being very cold certainly very cold and walked on rejoicing in having extricated him from randalls and secured him the power of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening,1,1,0.9884651235634383
my report from mrs goddard's said she presently was not so pleasant as i had hoped -- not better' was my answer,1,1,0.9409166976829519
what an excellent device said he the use of a sheepskin for carriages how very comfortable they make it -- impossible to feel cold with such precautions the contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete one is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted weather becomes absolutely of no consequence it is a very cold afternoon -- but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter -- ha snows a little i see,1,1,0.6873866409111976
now it so happened that in spite of emma's resolution of never marrying there was something in the name in the idea of mr frank churchill which always interested her she had frequently thought -- especially since his father's marriage with miss taylor -- that if she were to marry he was the very person to suit her in age character and condition he seemed by this connexion between the families quite to belong to her she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of that mr and mrs weston did think of it she was very strongly persuaded and though not meaning to be induced by him or by any body else to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for she had a great curiosity to see him a decided intention of finding him pleasant of being liked by him to a certain degree and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations,1,1,0.9983585350650757
yes -- i have some right to that knowledge though i have never been at the place in my life -- she is an odd woman -- but i never allow myself to speak ill of her on frank's account for i do believe her to be very fond of him i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been kind to him in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing to be as she likes and it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection for though i would not say it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper,1,1,0.9745842854424316
yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays even if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills' to keep him to themselves there is jealousy they are jealous even of his regard for his father in short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston were less sanguine,1,1,0.9417144783959921
he may have a great deal of influence on some points continued mrs weston and on others very little and among those on which she is beyond his reach it is but too likely may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us,1,1,0.9299758588145107
poor mr woodhouse was silent from consternation but every body else had something to say every body was either surprized or not surprized and had some question to ask or some comfort to offer mrs weston and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son-in-law who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly,1,1,0.9602251316680034
miss smith -- message to miss smith -- what could she possibly mean -- and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent such boastful pretence of amazement that she could not help replying with quickness,1,1,0.9362971073153897
charming miss woodhouse allow me to interpret this interesting silence it confesses that you have long understood me,1,1,0.8595502365966493
never madam cried he affronted in his turn never i assure you i think seriously of miss smith -- miss smith is a very good sort of girl and i should be happy to see her respectably settled i wish her extremely well and no doubt there are men who might not object to -- every body has their level but as for myself i am not i think quite so much at a loss i need not so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smith -- no madam my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only and the encouragement i received --,1,1,0.9936161521100378
the picture -- how eager he had been about the picture -- and the charade -- and an hundred other circumstances -- how clearly they had seemed to point at harriet to be sure the charade with its ready wit -- but then the soft eyes -- in fact it suited neither it was a jumble without taste or truth who could have seen through such thick-headed nonsense,1,1,0.8027871140191529
perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent and all the elegancies of mind the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior he must know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at hartfield the younger branch of a very ancient family -- and that the eltons were nobody the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate to which all the rest of highbury belonged but their fortune from other sources was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself in every other kind of consequence and the woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which mr elton had first entered not two years ago to make his way as he could without any alliances but in trade or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility -- but he had fancied her in love with him that evidently must have been his dependence and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging so full of courtesy and attention as supposing her real motive unperceived might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy like mr elton in fancying himself a very decided favourite if she had so misinterpreted his feelings she had little right to wonder that he with self-interest to blind him should have mistaken hers,1,1,0.9970448170062208
the first error and the worst lay at her door it was foolish it was wrong to take so active a part in bringing any two people together it was adventuring too far assuming too much making light of what ought to be serious a trick of what ought to be simple she was quite concerned and ashamed and resolved to do such things no more,1,1,0.7181481344697618
here have i said she actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man she might never have thought of him but for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope if i had not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest and humble as i used to think him oh that i had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young martin there i was quite right that was well done of me but there i should have stopped and left the rest to time and chance i was introducing her into good company and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having i ought not to have attempted more but now poor girl her peace is cut up for some time i have been but half a friend to her and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much i am sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her -- william coxe -- oh no i could not endure william coxe -- a pert young lawyer,1,1,0.9901928274191146
emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her and to depend on getting tolerably out of it,1,1,0.8967963978853586
it was a great consolation that mr elton should not be really in love with her or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that harriet's nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive -- and that there could be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except the three principals and especially for her father's being given a moment's uneasiness about it,1,1,0.9844999351008126
it did however -- her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey and his fears that mr elton might never get safely to the end of it and saw nothing extraordinary in his language it was a very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening mr woodhouse talked over his alarms and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude,1,1,0.9681871271245192
emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost and all that was amiable all that ought to be attaching seemed on harriet's side not her own harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of the affection of such a man as mr elton would have been too great a distinction -- she never could have deserved him -- and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible,1,1,0.9972791825596894
mr frank churchill did not come when the time proposed drew near mrs weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse for the present he could not be spared to his very great mortification and regret but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period,1,1,0.9933842144872699
how odd you are what has mr frank churchill done to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature,1,1,0.8731109375571195
and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure,1,1,0.7425329709906846
then it would not be so strong a sense if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction,1,1,0.8263599759611866
oh the difference of situation and habit i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life,1,1,0.815565282821647
your feelings are singular they seem to satisfy every body else,1,1,0.5304737244951796
thank you you are so kind replied the happily deceived aunt while eagerly hunting for the letter -- oh here it is i was sure it could not be far off but i had put my huswife upon it you see without being aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table i was reading it to mrs cole and since she went away i was reading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from jane -- that she can never hear it often enough so i knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says -- but first of all i really must in justice to jane apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well she often says when the letter is first opened well hetty now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work' -- don't you ma'am -- and then i tell her i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her -- every word of it -- i am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word and indeed though my mother's eyes are not so good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god with the help of spectacles it is such a blessing my mother's are really very good indeed jane often says when she is here i am sure grandmama you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too -- i only wish my eyes may last me as well ',1,1,0.9437082075032723
all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss fairfax's handwriting,1,1,0.9727634495315856
very true very true indeed the very thing that we have always been rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us for months together -- not able to come if any thing was to happen but you see every thing turns out for the best they want her mr and mrs dixon excessively to come over with colonel and mrs campbell quite depend upon it nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation jane says as you will hear presently mr dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention he is a most charming young man ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth when they were out in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails would have been dashed into the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he had not with the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit -- i can never think of it without trembling -- but ever since we had the history of that day i have been so fond of mr dixon,1,1,0.9843400320252711
but in spite of all her friends' urgency and her own wish of seeing ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs bates,1,1,0.9752569631628406
it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world,1,1,0.6773681350145663
emma could not forgive her -- but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr knightley who had been of the party and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side he was expressing the next morning being at hartfield again on business with mr woodhouse his approbation of the whole not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma he had been used to think her unjust to jane and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement,1,1,0.9982938753030811
no said mr knightley nearly at the same time you are not often deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension i think you understand me therefore,1,1,0.897293985569558
it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined a great pity indeed and i have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small trifling presents of any thing uncommon -- now we have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg it is very small and delicate -- hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and my dear emma unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast pork -- i think we had better send the leg -- do not you think so my dear,1,1,0.8933744987318903
that's right my dear very right i had not thought of it before but that is the best way they must not over-salt the leg and then if it is not over-salted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a boiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip i do not consider it unwholesome,1,1,0.5076183675132381
emma said mr knightley presently i have a piece of news for you you like news -- and i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you,1,1,0.8861385935500696
i was with mr cole on business an hour and a half ago he had just read elton's letter as i was shewn in and handed it to me directly,1,1,0.952773558293359
we consider our hartfield pork replied mr woodhouse -- indeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than --,1,1,0.9717173044840653
he is very young to settle was mr woodhouse's observation he had better not be in a hurry he seemed to me very well off as he was we were always glad to see him at hartfield,1,1,0.9377648956560839
nobody had any information to give and after a few more wonderings emma said,1,1,0.912056681962597
you are silent miss fairfax -- but i hope you mean to take an interest in this news you who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbell's account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr elton and miss hawkins,1,1,0.9876021645526268
my dear you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain and that you yourself --,1,1,0.9048002331004217
oh as for me my judgment is worth nothing where i have a regard i always think a person well-looking but i gave what i believed the general opinion when i called him plain,1,1,0.9069404248868037
emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock without retaining any influence to alarm as harriet now lived the martins could not get at her without seeking her where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her for since her refusal of the brother the sisters never had been at mrs goddard's and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again with any necessity or even any power of speech,1,1,0.9731957163196351
human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations that a young person who either marries or dies is sure of being kindly spoken of,1,1,0.7358135256539784
the pain of his continued residence in highbury however must certainly be lessened by his marriage many vain solicitudes would be prevented -- many awkwardnesses smoothed by it a mrs elton would be an excuse for any change of intercourse former intimacy might sink without remark it would be almost beginning their life of civility again,1,1,0.98365636376015
this is too bad cried emma as they turned away and now we shall just miss them too provoking -- i do not know when i have been so disappointed and she leaned back in the corner to indulge her murmurs or to reason them away probably a little of both -- such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind presently the carriage stopt she looked up it was stopt by mr and mrs weston who were standing to speak to her there was instant pleasure in the sight of them and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for mr weston immediately accosted her with,1,1,0.972888335420347
he had reached randalls the evening before she was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan and travel earlier later and quicker that he might gain half a day,1,1,0.8827164391602692
i told you yesterday cried mr weston with exultation i told you all that he would be here before the time named i remembered what i used to do myself one cannot creep upon a journey one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the pleasure of coming in upon one's friends before the look-out begins is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs,1,1,0.7577088427634812
oh go to-day go to-day do not defer it what is right to be done cannot be done too soon and besides i must give you a hint frank any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided you saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother who has barely enough to live on if you do not call early it will be a slight,1,1,0.9031319519360247
he agreed to it but with so quiet a yes as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world if jane fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it,1,1,0.9039893621468362
if you were never particularly struck by her manners before said she i think you will to-day you will see her to advantage see her and hear her -- no i am afraid you will not hear her at all for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue,1,1,0.8520265571228358
but your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street,1,0,0.4788281984891677
well said emma there is no disputing about taste -- at least you admire her except her complexion,1,1,0.8682827875446018
upon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any body that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her,1,1,0.930952568070305
i certainly do forget to think of her said emma as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend,1,1,0.9104022141697904
when the gloves were bought and they had quitted the shop again did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play said frank churchill,1,1,0.754680989660288
you think so do you -- i wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge she appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself -- i am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body's performance -- i have been used to hear her's admired and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well -- a man a very musical man and in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- on the point of marriage -- would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down instead -- never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other that i thought in a man of known musical talent was some proof,1,1,0.9001781824448718
it is a most repulsive quality indeed said he oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing there is safety in reserve but no attraction one cannot love a reserved person,1,1,0.824498540533837
mr weston on his side added a virtue to the account which must have some weight he gave her to understand that frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming and with so much to be said for him altogether she found she must not judge him harshly as mrs weston observed all young people would have their little whims,1,1,0.9863838972987293
but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared that when the insult came at last it found her very differently affected donwell and randalls had received their invitation and none had come for her father and herself and mrs weston's accounting for it with i suppose they will not take the liberty with you they know you do not dine out was not quite sufficient she felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal and afterwards as the idea of the party to be assembled there consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her occurred again and again she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept harriet was to be there in the evening and the bateses they had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence might not the evening end in a dance had been a question of his the bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits and her being left in solitary grandeur even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment was but poor comfort,1,1,0.9959113737122788
he came back had had his hair cut and laughed at himself with a very good grace but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done he had no reason to wish his hair longer to conceal any confusion of face no reason to wish the money unspent to improve his spirits he was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever and after seeing him emma thus moralised to herself --,1,1,0.7981022783048475
this is coming as you should do said she like a gentleman -- i am quite glad to see you,1,0,0.4809076157451003
perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before,1,1,0.9510043225221375
that is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large for mrs bates's house,1,1,0.883255652898188
mrs dixon very true indeed i had not thought of mrs dixon she must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument would be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize is more like a young woman's scheme than an elderly man's it is mrs dixon i dare say i told you that your suspicions would guide mine,1,1,0.9631710414846175
yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i had entertained before -- i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help suspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune to fall in love with her or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland here she must be leading a life of privation and penance there it would have been all enjoyment as to the pretence of trying her native air i look upon that as a mere excuse -- in the summer it might have passed but what can any body's native air do for them in the months of january february and march good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i dare say in her's i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly tell you what they are,1,1,0.9573314945083682
there was no occasion to press the matter farther the conviction seemed real he looked as if he felt it she said no more other subjects took their turn and the rest of the dinner passed away the dessert succeeded the children came in and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation a few clever things said a few downright silly but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks dull repetitions old news and heavy jokes,1,1,0.7282168655062231
smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards miss fairfax but it was most prudent to avoid speech he told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room -- hated sitting long -- was always the first to move when he could -- that his father mr knightley mr cox and mr cole were left very busy over parish business -- that as long as he had staid however it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike sensible men and spoke so handsomely of highbury altogether -- thought it so abundant in agreeable families -- that emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire -- the extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe and the sort and could make out from his answers that as far as enscombe was concerned there was very little going on that their visitings were among a range of great families none very near and that even when days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even chance that mrs churchill were not in health and spirits for going that they made a point of visiting no fresh person and that though he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty without considerable address at times that he could get away or introduce an acquaintance for a night,1,1,0.9959672669506493
she saw that enscombe could not satisfy and that highbury taken at its best might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked his importance at enscombe was very evident he did not boast but it naturally betrayed itself that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing and on her laughing and noticing it he owned that he believed excepting one or two points he could with time persuade her to any thing one of those points on which his influence failed he then mentioned he had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it this had happened the year before now he said he was beginning to have no longer the same wish,1,1,0.9807708396676358
very true -- well a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night and cold as the nights are now and as i looked at her though i never saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she was heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold poor girl i could not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr weston came into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about the carriage you may guess how readily he came into my wishes and having his approbation i made my way directly to miss bates to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once good soul she was as grateful as possible you may be sure nobody was ever so fortunate as herself ' -- but with many many thanks -- there was no occasion to trouble us for mr knightley's carriage had brought and was to take them home again ' i was quite surprized -- very glad i am sure but really quite surprized such a very kind attention -- and so thoughtful an attention -- the sort of thing that so few men would think of and in short from knowing his usual ways i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them,1,1,0.9970694283288232
well said mrs weston smiling you give him credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do for while miss bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and i have never been able to get it out again the more i think of it the more probable it appears in short i have made a match between mr knightley and jane fairfax see the consequence of keeping you company -- what do you say to it,1,1,0.9868614145188292
my dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really loves jane fairfax --,1,1,0.9656854505864294
well said mrs weston laughing perhaps the greatest good he could do them would be to give jane such a respectable home,1,1,0.9767775921040311
you take up an idea mrs weston and run away with it as you have many a time reproached me with doing i see no sign of attachment -- i believe nothing of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me that mr knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax,1,1,0.9885579951384199
perhaps it is as well said frank churchill as he attended emma to her carriage i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me after your's,1,1,0.9917174275549584
are you sure i saw she had execution but i did not know she had any taste nobody talked about it and i hate italian singing -- there is no understanding a word of it besides if she does play so very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do because she will have to teach the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family how did you think the coxes looked,1,1,0.729325100396972
emma was obliged to ask what they had told her though fearful of its producing mr elton,1,1,0.9559744827853721
do come with me said mrs weston if it be not very disagreeable to you it need not detain us long we will go to hartfield afterwards we will follow them to hartfield i really wish you to call with me it will be felt so great an attention and i always thought you meant it,1,1,0.9369873651511921
aye that will be much best said harriet quite satisfied i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs goddard's,1,1,0.9625847011007026
my dear miss woodhouse said the latter i am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while and give us your opinion of our new instrument you and miss smith how do you do miss smith -- very well i thank you -- and i begged mrs weston to come with me that i might be sure of succeeding,1,1,0.9793163652979224
i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of -- oh my mother's spectacles so very obliging of mr frank churchill oh ' said he i do think i can fasten the rivet i like a job of this kind excessively ' -- which you know shewed him to be so very indeed i must say that much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected he very far exceeds any thing i do congratulate you mrs weston most warmly he seems every thing the fondest parent could oh ' said he i can fasten the rivet i like a job of that sort excessively ' i never shall forget his manner and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some oh ' said he directly there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good and these are the finest-looking home-baked apples i ever saw in my life ' that you know was so very and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment indeed they are very delightful apples and mrs wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice and mr woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times -- but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking beyond a doubt all from donwell -- some of mr knightley's most liberal supply he sends us a sack every year and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- i believe there is two of them my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days but i was really quite shocked the other day -- for mr knightley called one morning and jane was eating these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock i am sure you must be ' said he and i will send you another supply for i have a great many more than i can ever use william larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year i will send you some more before they get good for nothing ' so i begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone i could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed but they should be all kept for jane and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he had been already and jane said the same and when he was gone she almost quarrelled with me -- no i should not say quarrelled for we never had a quarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished i had made him believe we had a great many left oh said i my dear i did say as much as i could however the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same sort of apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing as you may suppose william larkins is such an old acquaintance i am always glad to see him but however i found afterwards from patty that william said it was all the apples of that sort his master had he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil william did not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william you know thinks more of his master's profit than any thing but mrs hodges he said was quite displeased at their being all sent away she could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple-tart this spring he told patty this but bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us about it for mrs hodges would be cross sometimes and as long as so many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder and so patty told me and i was excessively shocked indeed i would not have mr knightley know any thing about it for the world he would be so very i wanted to keep it from jane's knowledge but unluckily i had mentioned it before i was aware,1,1,0.9902836206837174
miss bates had just done as patty opened the door and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will,1,1,0.8806595559113709
pray take care mrs weston there is a step at the turning pray take care miss woodhouse ours is rather a dark staircase -- rather darker and narrower than one could wish miss smith pray take care miss woodhouse i am quite concerned i am sure you hit your foot miss smith the step at the turning,1,1,0.9294299143444675
what said mrs weston have not you finished it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate,1,1,0.7644643874893415
at last jane began and though the first bars were feebly given the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to mrs weston had been delighted before and was delighted again emma joined her in all her praise and the pianoforte with every proper discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise,1,1,0.9829051045290047
conjecture -- aye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse when hard at work if one talks at all -- your real workmen i suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word -- miss fairfax said something about conjecturing there it is done i have the pleasure madam to mrs bates of restoring your spectacles healed for the present,1,1,0.8353792938063153
emma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness there had been a smile of secret delight she had less scruple in the amusement and much less compunction with respect to her -- this amiable upright perfect jane fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings,1,1,0.9870591725437441
i hope she does i would have her understand me i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning,1,1,0.8222431636916453
she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening the casement there immediately called mr knightley's attention and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others as if it had passed within the same apartment,1,1,0.9175146110008418
how d' ye do -- how d'ye do -- very well i thank you so obliged to you for the carriage last night we were just in time my mother just ready for us pray come in do come in you will find some friends here,1,0,0.4225296695073264
oh dear kingston -- are you -- mrs cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston,1,1,0.9208918813544608
and here is mrs weston and mr frank churchill too -- quite delightful so many friends,1,1,0.9891609578845959
oh mr knightley one moment more something of consequence -- so shocked -- jane and i are both so shocked about the apples,1,1,0.911073644541193
oh yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door was open and the window was open and mr knightley spoke loud you must have heard every thing to be sure can i do any thing for you at kingston ' said he so i just mentioned oh miss woodhouse must you be going -- you seem but just come -- so very obliging of you,1,1,0.9347882356068741
you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five had been repeated many times over and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr knightley yes that will be quite enough for pleasure you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room,1,1,0.9722907294054134
mrs weston was sorry for such a charge she knew the importance of it and said every thing in her power to do it away every door was now closed the passage plan given up and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again and with such good-will on frank churchill's part that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten,1,1,0.9652650820838752
i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple,1,1,0.8174327340532298
it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and mrs weston do not i think it admirable and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happy -- it seems the only improvement that could be papa do you not think it an excellent improvement,1,1,0.9559842342759344
mrs weston proposed having no regular supper merely sandwiches c set out in the little room but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion a private dance without sitting down to supper was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women and mrs weston must not speak of it again she then took another line of expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed,1,1,0.8551809494535568
i do not think it is so very small we shall not be many you know,1,0,0.44284684794471807
you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates said emma she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing she will not even listen to your questions i see no advantage in consulting miss bates,1,1,0.9591215798418822
here mr weston joined them and on hearing what was proposed gave it his decided approbation,1,1,0.942700663639373
most cordially when miss bates arrived did she agree that it must as a counsellor she was not wanted but as an approver a much safer character she was truly welcome her approbation at once general and minute warm and incessant could not but please and for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro between the different rooms some suggesting some attending and all in happy enjoyment of the future the party did not break up without emma's being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening nor without her overhearing mr weston whisper to his wife he has asked her my dear that's right i knew he would,1,1,0.9797321570545371
one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to emma -- its being fixed for a day within the granted term of frank churchill's stay in surry for in spite of mr weston's confidence she could not think it so very impossible that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight but this was not judged feasible the preparations must take their time nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on and for a few days they must be planning proceeding and hoping in uncertainty -- at the risk -- in her opinion the great risk of its being all in vain,1,1,0.9926524963931834
mrs weston added that he could only allow himself time to hurry to highbury after breakfast and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him and that he might be expected at hartfield very soon,1,1,0.9851705278827145
yes -- i have called there passing the door i thought it better it was a right thing to do i went in for three minutes and was detained by miss bates's being absent she was out and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in she is a woman that one may that one must laugh at but that one would not wish to slight it was better to pay my visit then --,1,1,0.881206209205714
he was silent she believed he was looking at her probably reflecting on what she had said and trying to understand the manner she heard him sigh it was natural for him to feel that he had cause to sigh he could not believe her to be encouraging him a few awkward moments passed and he sat down again and in a more determined manner said,1,1,0.9033427786193584
he stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassed -- he was more in love with her than emma had supposed and who can say how it might have ended if his father had not made his appearance mr woodhouse soon followed and the necessity of exertion made him composed,1,1,0.9565222731150815
poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could give emma felt that she could not do too much for her that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect for ever agreed to without being able to make their opinions the same harriet listened submissively and said it was very true -- it was just as miss woodhouse described -- it was not worth while to think about them -- and she would not think about them any longer but no change of subject could avail and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before at last emma attacked her on another ground,1,1,0.9960612730118285
i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less talk less of mr elton for my sake because for your own sake rather i would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comfort a habit of self-command in you a consideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity these are the motives which i have been pressing on you they are very important -- and sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration i want you to save yourself from greater pain perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me,1,1,0.9702964762812791
this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse whom she really loved extremely made her wretched for a while and when the violence of grief was comforted away still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably,1,1,0.9594736271177363
such expressions assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do made emma feel that she had never loved harriet so well nor valued her affection so highly before,1,1,0.9803633451932788
mrs elton was first seen at church but though devotion might be interrupted curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid to settle whether she were very pretty indeed or only rather pretty or not pretty at all,1,1,0.9396038225786487
well miss woodhouse said harriet when they had quitted the house and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin well miss woodhouse with a gentle sigh what do you think of her -- is not she very charming,1,1,0.9888299216418525
harriet would have been a better match if not wise or refined herself she would have connected him with those who were but miss hawkins it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit had been the best of her own set the rich brother-in-law near bristol was the pride of the alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride of him,1,1,0.951213613164492
so extremely like maple grove and it is not merely the house -- the grounds i assure you as far as i could observe are strikingly like the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here and stand very much in the same way -- just across the lawn and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree with a bench round it which put me so exactly in mind my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style,1,1,0.7626612941226898
she restrained herself however from any of the reproofs she could have given and only thanked mrs elton coolly but their going to bath was quite out of the question and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father and then to prevent farther outrage and indignation changed the subject directly,1,1,0.988194574800261
i dare say your apologies were accepted sir mr elton knows you,1,1,0.8979789709108157
well papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know what is and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies,1,1,0.9252736723274885
full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its fragrance on the desert air ',1,0,0.12914720620013956
we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax,1,1,0.9078232380369299
my dear miss woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act you and i need not be afraid if we set the example many will follow it as far as they can though all have not our situations we have carriages to fetch and convey her home and we live in a style which could not make the addition of jane fairfax at any time the least inconvenient -- i should be extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked more than jane fairfax to partake of it i have no idea of that sort of thing it is not likely that i should considering what i have been used to my greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be -- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr suckling in income -- however my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax -- i shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce her wherever i can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation my acquaintance is so very extensive that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly -- i shall introduce her of course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us i am sure they will like her extremely and when she gets a little acquainted with them her fears will completely wear off for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating -- i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties,1,1,0.9969178506915087
emma had not to listen to such paradings again -- to any so exclusively addressed to herself -- so disgustingly decorated with a dear miss woodhouse the change on mrs elton's side soon afterwards appeared and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of mrs elton nor under mrs elton's guidance the very active patroness of jane fairfax and only sharing with others in a general way in knowing what was felt what was meditated what was done,1,1,0.9961543119386267
she is a riddle quite a riddle said she -- to chuse to remain here month after month under privations of every sort and now to chuse the mortification of mrs elton's notice and the penury of her conversation rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real generous affection,1,1,0.9403156488249778
no indeed i have not you have scolded me too much for match-making for me to presume to take such a liberty with you what i said just now meant nothing one says those sort of things of course without any idea of a serious meaning oh no upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married,1,1,0.9582347748599017
well mrs weston said emma triumphantly when he left them what do you say now to mr knightley's marrying jane fairfax,1,1,0.9970191105782975
the persons to be invited required little thought besides the eltons it must be the westons and mr knightley so far it was all of course -- and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make the eighth -- but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction and on many accounts emma was particularly pleased by harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it she would rather not be in his company more than she could help she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together without feeling uncomfortable if miss woodhouse would not be displeased she would rather stay at home it was precisely what emma would have wished had she deemed it possible enough for wishing she was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend -- for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth jane fairfax -- since her last conversation with mrs weston and mr knightley she was more conscience-stricken about jane fairfax than she had often been -- mr knightley's words dwelt with her he had said that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs elton which nobody else paid her,1,1,0.9998525947366537
every invitation was successful they were all disengaged and all happy -- the preparatory interest of this dinner however was not yet over a circumstance rather unlucky occurred the two eldest little knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring and their papa now proposed bringing them and staying one whole day at hartfield -- which one day would be the very day of this party -- his professional engagements did not allow of his being put off but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so mr woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear -- and here would be a ninth -- and emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party,1,1,0.9911382034665661
i went only to the post-office said she and reached home before the rain was much it is my daily errand i always fetch the letters when i am here it saves trouble and is a something to get me out a walk before breakfast does me good,1,1,0.5855209500646787
ah you are not serious now i know mr john knightley too well -- i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body i can easily believe that letters are very little to you much less than to me but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference it is not age but situation you have every body dearest to you always at hand i probably never shall again and therefore till i have outlived all my affections a post-office i think must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than to-day,1,1,0.9552293668048588
excuse me said jane earnestly i cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant if the errand were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it always is when i am not here by my grandmama's,1,1,0.9324576228935596
the clerks grow expert from habit -- they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand and exercise improves them if you want any farther explanation continued he smiling they are paid for it that is the key to a great deal of capacity the public pays and must be served well,1,0,0.48863330458128257
this was not submitted to by either lady they vindicated him against the base aspersion no it by no means wanted strength -- it was not a large hand but very clear and certainly strong had not mrs weston any letter about her to produce no she had heard from him very lately but having answered the letter had put it away,1,1,0.9147331781559357
if we were in the other room said emma if i had my writing-desk i am sure i could produce a specimen i have a note of his -- do not you remember mrs weston employing him to write for you one day,1,1,0.8833331065074955
dinner was on table -- mrs elton before she could be spoken to was ready and before mr woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour was saying --,1,1,0.977975999289892
thank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her till the time draws nearer i do not wish to be giving any body trouble,1,1,0.8316438585688541
excuse me ma'am but this is by no means my intention i make no inquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends when i am quite determined as to the time i am not at all afraid of being long unemployed there are places in town offices where inquiry would soon produce something -- offices for the sale -- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect,1,1,0.7462973236057654
mrs weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion her looks and words had nothing to restrain them she was happy she knew she was happy and knew she ought to be happy her congratulations were warm and open but emma could not speak so fluently she was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings and trying to understand the degree of her agitation which she rather thought was considerable,1,1,0.9923578144631611
i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you said mr weston,1,1,0.9290862218371946
aye we men are sad fellows you must take care of yourself mrs elton -- this letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly on mrs churchill's account -- she has not been well the whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for her -- so they are all to move southward without loss of time,1,1,0.959512719390389
yes upon my word very considerable sixty-five miles farther than from maple grove to london but what is distance mr weston to people of large fortune -- you would be amazed to hear how my brother mr suckling sometimes flies about you will hardly believe me -- but twice in one week he and mr bragge went to london and back again with four horses,1,1,0.9232819849387045
depend upon it mrs churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did mrs churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for --,1,1,0.9662219524323832
is not she then she is no rule for mrs churchill who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld,1,1,0.9101551146039687
you were mentioning may may is the very month which mrs churchill is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than enscombe -- in short to spend in london so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring -- precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise when he was here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know and we could not do half that we intended now will be the time this will be complete enjoyment and i do not know mrs elton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house i think it is so i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight i hope you will be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy he is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy mrs weston's partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most gratifying to me she thinks nobody equal to him,1,1,0.9935405712779524
after tea mr and mrs weston and mr elton sat down with mr woodhouse to cards the remaining five were left to their own powers and emma doubted their getting on very well for mr knightley seemed little disposed for conversation mrs elton was wanting notice which nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent,1,1,0.9982885581000143
mr john knightley proved more talkative than his brother he was to leave them early the next day and he soon began with --,1,1,0.931666726872075
i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father -- or even may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately,1,1,0.8264745737192187
certainly you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a great difference in your way of life,1,1,0.682357524561262
mr knightley seemed to be trying not to smile and succeeded without difficulty upon mrs elton's beginning to talk to him,1,1,0.9667157749816602
a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed it was for him her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing it was not worth thinking of -- but if he who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away it would be very distressing if a separation of two months should not have cooled him there were dangers and evils before her -- caution for him and for herself would be necessary she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his,1,1,0.9955936374731235
it was not very long though rather longer than mr weston had foreseen before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchill's feelings the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined but he was at highbury very soon afterwards he rode down for a couple of hours he could not yet do more but as he came from randalls immediately to hartfield she could then exercise all her quick observation and speedily determine how he was influenced and how she must act they met with the utmost friendliness there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her but she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree she watched him well it was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been absence with the conviction probably of her indifference had produced this very natural and very desirable effect,1,1,0.9983474332218759
frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch and though he did not say much his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening they all walked about together to see that every thing was as it should be and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage which emma could not hear the sound of at first without great surprize so unreasonably early she was going to exclaim but she presently found that it was a family of old friends who were coming like herself by particular desire to help mr weston's judgment and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness on the same errand that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection,1,1,0.9898463885310623
a carriage was heard he was on the move immediately but coming back said,1,1,0.6925542769184427
but miss bates and miss fairfax said mr weston looking about we thought you were to bring them,1,1,0.9865499694613007
while she talked of his son mr weston's attention was chained but when she got to maple grove he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must hurry away,1,1,0.9787730218263373
miss bates and miss fairfax escorted by the two gentlemen walked into the room and mrs elton seemed to think it as much her duty as mrs weston's to receive them her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma but her words every body's words were soon lost under the incessant flow of miss bates who came in talking and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire as the door opened she was heard,1,1,0.9822589587340457
and what are we to do for a proper partner for her said mr weston she will think frank ought to ask her,1,1,0.9506158091878545
escape however was not his plan he came to the part of the room where the sitters-by were collected spoke to some and walked about in front of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution of maintaining it he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith or speaking to those who were close to her -- emma saw it she was not yet dancing she was working her way up from the bottom and had therefore leisure to look around and by only turning her head a little she saw it all when she was half-way up the set the whole group were exactly behind her and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch but mr elton was so near that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and mrs weston and she perceived that his wife who was standing immediately above her was not only listening also but even encouraging him by significant glances -- the kind-hearted gentle mrs weston had left her seat to join him and say do not you dance mr elton to which his prompt reply was most readily mrs weston if you will dance with me,1,1,0.9840152752658252
if mrs gilbert wishes to dance said he i shall have great pleasure i am sure -- for though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man and that my dancing days are over it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs gilbert,1,1,0.8478940940410871
she would not look again her heart was in a glow and she feared her face might be as hot,1,1,0.6969230274128907
his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it extremely good and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky if it had not been for the cruel state of things before and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced it was not thrown away on her she bounded higher than ever flew farther down the middle and was in a continual course of smiles,1,1,0.8971488514994032
supper was announced the move began and miss bates might be heard from that moment without interruption till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon,1,1,0.819954592375407
emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr knightley till after supper but when they were all in the ballroom again her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked he was warm in his reprobation of mr elton's conduct it had been unpardonable rudeness and mrs elton's looks also received the due share of censure,1,1,0.9916088158679592
i did replied emma and they cannot forgive me,1,1,0.7957054155906346
can you trust me with such flatterers -- does my vain spirit ever tell me i am wrong,1,0,0.3340112610418268
i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr elton there is a littleness about him which you discovered and which i did not and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet it was through a series of strange blunders,1,1,0.9516028739353086
she hesitated a moment and then replied with you if you will ask me,1,0,0.4740251085847709
she was not to see frank churchill this morning he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield as he was to be at home by the middle of the day she did not regret it,1,1,0.9644951595926557
a young lady who faints must be recovered questions must be answered and surprizes be explained such events are very interesting but the suspense of them cannot last long a few minutes made emma acquainted with the whole,1,1,0.8854446640561631
how the trampers might have behaved had the young ladies been more courageous must be doubtful but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted and harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children headed by a stout woman and a great boy all clamorous and impertinent in look though not absolutely in word -- more and more frightened she immediately promised them money and taking out her purse gave them a shilling and begged them not to want more or to use her ill -- she was then able to walk though but slowly and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting and she was followed or rather surrounded by the whole gang demanding more,1,1,0.917614675440196
it was a very extraordinary thing nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place within her memory no rencontre no alarm of the kind -- and now it had happened to the very person and at the very hour when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her -- it certainly was very extraordinary -- and knowing as she did the favourable state of mind of each at this period it struck her the more he was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself she just recovering from her mania for mr elton it seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other,1,1,0.9621257852414288
it is my duty and i am sure it is my wish she continued to have no reserves with you on this subject as i am happily quite an altered creature in one respect it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it i do not want to say more than is necessary -- i am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done and i dare say you understand me,1,1,0.9165933023075383
how i could so long a time be fancying myself cried harriet warmly it seems like madness i can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now -- i do not care whether i meet him or not -- except that of the two i had rather not see him -- and indeed i would go any distance round to avoid him -- but i do not envy his wife in the least i neither admire her nor envy her as i have done she is very charming i dare say and all that but i think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable -- i shall never forget her look the other night -- however i assure you miss woodhouse i wish her no evil -- no let them be ever so happy together it will not give me another moment's pang and to convince you that i have been speaking truth i am now going to destroy -- what i ought to have destroyed long ago -- what i ought never to have kept -- i know that very well blushing as she spoke -- however now i will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence that you may see how rational i am grown cannot you guess what this parcel holds said she with a conscious look,1,1,0.9740003137982096
and so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake said emma recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement and secretly she added to herself lord bless me when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court-plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about i never was equal to this,1,1,0.8850096575991295
but harriet is it necessary to burn the court-plaister -- i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the court-plaister might be useful,1,1,0.5521829216051933
she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made and could not but hope that the gipsy though she had told no fortune might be proved to have made harriet's -- about a fortnight after the alarm they came to a sufficient explanation and quite undesignedly emma was not thinking of it at the moment which made the information she received more valuable she merely said in the course of some trivial chat well harriet whenever you marry i would advise you to do so and so -- and thought no more of it till after a minute's silence she heard harriet say in a very serious tone i shall never marry,1,1,0.9856935977778474
after another short hesitation i hope it does not proceed from -- i hope it is not in compliment to mr elton,1,1,0.943363456010239
service oh it was such an inexpressible obligation -- the very recollection of it and all that i felt at the time -- when i saw him coming -- his noble look -- and my wretchedness before such a change in one moment such a change from perfect misery to perfect happiness,1,1,0.8234056914255292
by the bye said frank churchill to mrs weston presently what became of mr perry's plan of setting up his carriage,1,1,0.9877172861175068
indeed you did i remember it perfectly you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon mrs perry had told somebody and was extremely happy about it it was owing to her persuasion as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm you must remember it now,1,1,0.9779780529026711
what is this -- what is this cried mr weston about perry and a carriage is perry going to set up his carriage frank i am glad he can afford it you had it from himself had you,1,1,0.9560191443844753
it was done however this gallant young man who seemed to love without feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance directly handed over the word to miss fairfax and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it mr knightley's excessive curiosity to know what this word might be made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it and it was not long before he saw it to be dixon jane fairfax's perception seemed to accompany his her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning the superior intelligence of those five letters so arranged she was evidently displeased looked up and seeing herself watched blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her and saying only i did not know that proper names were allowed pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered her face was averted from those who had made the attack and turned towards her aunt,1,1,0.9932627253912859
my dear emma said he at last with earnest kindness do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of,1,1,0.9720257141889951
oh you amuse me excessively i am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do there is no admiration between them i do assure you and the appearances which have caught you have arisen from some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather of a totally different nature -- it is impossible exactly to explain -- there is a good deal of nonsense in it -- but the part which is capable of being communicated which is sense is that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another as any two beings in the world can be that is i presume it to be so on her side and i can answer for its being so on his i will answer for the gentleman's indifference,1,1,0.928275584020577
after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr and mrs suckling the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present in the daily interchange of news they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings' coming had been united such as the last accounts of mrs churchill whose health seemed every day to supply a different report and the situation of mrs weston whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it,1,1,0.9921543699592815
i am glad you approve of what i have done said he very comfortably but i thought you would such schemes as these are nothing without numbers one cannot have too large a party a large party secures its own amusement and she is a good-natured woman after all one could not leave her out,1,1,0.8595551758655683
not quite my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining-room the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniture i think is best observed by meals within doors when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house,1,0,0.46447191650816483
i wish we had a donkey the thing would be for us all to come on donkeys jane miss bates and me -- and my caro sposo walking by i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey in a country life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary for let a woman have ever so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home -- and very long walks you know -- in summer there is dust and in winter there is dirt,1,1,0.8398827241513225
under a bright mid-day sun at almost midsummer mr woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage with one window down to partake of this al-fresco party and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the abbey especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning he was happily placed quite at his ease ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved and advise every body to come and sit down and not to heat themselves -- mrs weston who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired and sit all the time with him remained when all the others were invited or persuaded out his patient listener and sympathiser,1,1,0.9054430448841266
it was a sweet view -- sweet to the eye and the mind english verdure english culture english comfort seen under a sun bright without being oppressive,1,0,0.126886513378319
that may be -- but not by sketches in swisserland you will never go to swisserland your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave england,1,1,0.7033047831828203
we are going to box hill to-morrow -- you will join us it is not swisserland but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change you will stay and go with us,1,1,0.515066019243432
they had a very fine day for box hill and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement accommodation and punctuality were in favour of a pleasant party mr weston directed the whole officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage and every body was in good time emma and harriet went together miss bates and her niece with the eltons the gentlemen on horseback mrs weston remained with mr woodhouse nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency there was a languor a want of spirits a want of union which could not be got over they separated too much into parties the eltons walked together mr knightley took charge of miss bates and jane and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill and mr weston tried in vain to make them harmonise better it seemed at first an accidental division but it never materially varied mr and mrs elton indeed shewed no unwillingness to mix and be as agreeable as they could but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill there seemed a principle of separation between the other parties too strong for any fine prospects or any cold collation or any cheerful mr weston to remove,1,1,0.999692308236639
when they all sat down it was better to her taste a great deal better for frank churchill grew talkative and gay making her his first object every distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her to amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he cared for -- and emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered was gay and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement the admission to be gallant which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance but which now in her own estimation meant nothing though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very well describe mr frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively they were laying themselves open to that very phrase -- and to having it sent off in a letter to maple grove by one lady to ireland by another not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected she laughed because she was disappointed and though she liked him for his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship admiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning back her heart she still intended him for her friend,1,1,0.998772773990393
you are comfortable because you are under command,1,0,0.41009085257363426
i like your plan cried mr weston agreed agreed i will do my best i am making a conundrum how will a conundrum reckon,1,1,0.7657507415396397
i doubt its being very clever myself said mr weston it is too much a matter of fact but here it is -- what two letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection,1,1,0.7606049627514957
well i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever i marry i hope some body will chuse my wife for me will you turning to emma will you chuse a wife for me -- i am sure i should like any body fixed on by you you provide for the family you know with a smile at his father find some body for me i am in no hurry adopt her educate her,1,1,0.9178320681556731
emma was in no danger of forgetting it was a commission to touch every favourite feeling would not harriet be the very creature described hazle eyes excepted two years more might make her all that he wished he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment who could say referring the education to her seemed to imply it,1,1,0.9744949103140651
while they talked they were advancing towards the carriage it was ready and before she could speak again he had handed her in he had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted and her tongue motionless they were combined only of anger against herself mortification and deep concern she had not been able to speak and on entering the carriage sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave making no acknowledgment parting in apparent sullenness she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference but it was just too late he had turned away and the horses were in motion she continued to look back but in vain and soon with what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill and every thing left far behind she was vexed beyond what could have been expressed -- almost beyond what she could conceal never had she felt so agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance in her life she was most forcibly struck the truth of this representation there was no denying she felt it at her heart how could she have been so brutal so cruel to miss bates how could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued and how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude of concurrence of common kindness,1,1,0.9853060836665296
poor old mrs bates civil and humble as usual looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on,1,1,0.8965424919258762
i am afraid jane is not very well said she but i do not know they tell me she is well i dare say my daughter will be here presently miss woodhouse i hope you find a chair i wish hetty had not gone i am very little able -- have you a chair ma'am do you sit where you like i am sure she will be here presently,1,1,0.9281590463577682
emma seriously hoped she would she had a moment's fear of miss bates keeping away from her but miss bates soon came -- very happy and obliged -- but emma's conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax she hoped might lead the way to a return of old feelings the touch seemed immediate,1,1,0.9963530505015794
emma was most sincerely interested her heart had been long growing kinder towards jane and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing but pity and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past obliged her to admit that jane might very naturally resolve on seeing mrs cole or any other steady friend when she might not bear to see herself she spoke as she felt with earnest regret and solicitude -- sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually determined on might be as much for miss fairfax's advantage and comfort as possible it must be a severe trial to them all she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbell's return,1,1,0.9995646577516657
there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest and it caught emma's attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind the contrast between mrs churchill's importance in the world and jane fairfax's struck her one was every thing the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman's destiny and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed till roused by miss bates's saying,1,1,0.9886403187996919
i would not go away without seeing you but i have no time to spare and therefore must now be gone directly i am going to london to spend a few days with john and isabella have you any thing to send or say besides the love ' which nobody carries,1,1,0.9485303667925996
i am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled mrs elton is very good-natured and agreeable and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be i hope it is a dry situation and that her health will be taken good care of it ought to be a first object as i am sure poor miss taylor's always was with me you know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us and i hope she will be better off in one respect and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long,1,1,0.994223712654319
harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion with great self-command what ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing emma was gratified to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance they spoke therefore of mrs churchill's death with mutual forbearance,1,1,0.9902971513280542
short letters from frank were received at randalls communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans mr churchill was better than could be expected and their first removal on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire was to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor to whom mr churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years at present there was nothing to be done for harriet good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on emma's side,1,1,0.9946183990860874
miss fairfax's compliments and thanks but is quite unequal to any exercise,1,1,0.9349825245238975
emma on reaching home called the housekeeper directly to an examination of her stores and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note in half an hour the arrowroot was returned with a thousand thanks from miss bates but dear jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back it was a thing she could not take -- and moreover she insisted on her saying that she was not at all in want of any thing,1,1,0.9765880561541792
one morning about ten days after mrs churchill's decease emma was called downstairs to mr weston who could not stay five minutes and wanted particularly to speak with her -- he met her at the parlour-door and hardly asking her how she did in the natural key of his voice sunk it immediately to say unheard by her father,1,1,0.9789780182387338
your word -- why not your honour -- why not say upon your honour that it has nothing to do with any of them good heavens -- what can be to be broke to me that does not relate to one of that family,1,0,0.3870305778872583
upon my honour said he very seriously it does not it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley,1,1,0.82733074750208
who is that gentleman on horseback said she as they proceeded -- speaking more to assist mr weston in keeping his secret than with any other view,1,1,0.8376864306280973
oh yes -- did not you know -- well well never mind,1,1,0.6009655004426735
for a moment he was silent and then added in a tone much more guarded and demure,1,0,0.4501888604167178
you are right it does relate to him and i will tell you directly resuming her work and seeming resolved against looking up he has been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand it is impossible to express our surprize he came to speak to his father on a subject -- to announce an attachment --,1,1,0.7938333876711509
more than an attachment indeed resumed mrs weston an engagement -- a positive engagement -- what will you say emma -- what will any body say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engaged -- nay that they have been long engaged,1,1,0.9959741628844893
mrs weston kissed her with tears of joy and when she could find utterance assured her that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do,1,1,0.9235115470558399
from something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine --,1,1,0.8939282601824303
good god cried emma not attending to her -- mrs smallridge too jane actually on the point of going as governess what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy to suffer her to engage herself -- to suffer her even to think of such a measure,1,1,0.9548174458944362
emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush,1,1,0.9532280977018786
i am quite easy on that head replied mrs weston i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other which both might not have heard,1,1,0.9286680506714838
much indeed cried emma feelingly if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like jane fairfax's -- of such one may almost say that the world is not their's nor the world's law ',1,1,0.9509766005257879
she met mr weston on his entrance with a smiling countenance exclaiming,1,1,0.925951963702127
a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word this was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of guessing but you really frightened me i thought you had lost half your property at least and here instead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one of congratulation -- i congratulate you mr weston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter,1,1,0.8031068341145784
what did mr weston tell you -- said emma still perplexed,1,1,0.929823811650893
had you any idea cried harriet of his being in love with her -- you perhaps might -- you blushing as she spoke who can see into every body's heart but nobody else --,1,1,0.9000258926765483
harriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned from her did not immediately say any thing and when she did speak it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emma's,1,1,0.8814618218042881
i should not have thought it possible she began that you could have misunderstood me i know we agreed never to name him -- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person mr frank churchill indeed i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr frank churchill who is like nobody by his side and that you should have been so mistaken is amazing -- i am sure but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost to dare to think of him at first if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very words -- i should not have dared to give way to -- i should not have thought it possible -- but if you who had been always acquainted with him --,1,1,0.9887666070282263
my dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely natural -- and you agreed to it expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue -- the impression of it is strong on my memory,1,1,0.9354097959282152
good god cried emma this has been a most unfortunate -- most deplorable mistake -- what is to be done,1,1,0.706978951108001
emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn and she sat silently meditating in a fixed attitude for a few minutes a few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart a mind like hers once opening to suspicion made rapid progress she touched -- she admitted -- she acknowledged the whole truth why was it so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr knightley than with frank churchill why was the evil so dreadfully increased by harriet's having some hope of a return it darted through her with the speed of an arrow that mr knightley must marry no one but herself,1,1,0.9858974078904488
harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances -- emma knew that he had on that occasion found her much superior to his expectation from that evening or at least from the time of miss woodhouse's encouraging her to think of him harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her a manner of kindness and sweetness -- latterly she had been more and more aware of it when they had been all walking together he had so often come and walked by her and talked so very delightfully -- he seemed to want to be acquainted with her emma knew it to have been very much the case she had often observed the change to almost the same extent -- harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him -- and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet he praised her for being without art or affectation for having simple honest generous feelings -- she knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet he had dwelt on them to her more than once -- much that lived in harriet's memory many little particulars of the notice she had received from him a look a speech a removal from one chair to another a compliment implied a preference inferred had been unnoticed because unsuspected by emma circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned the two of strongest promise to harriet were not without some degree of witness from emma herself -- the first was his walking with her apart from the others in the lime-walk at donwell where they had been walking some time before emma came and he had taken pains as she was convinced to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before in a very particular way indeed -- harriet could not recall it without a blush he seemed to be almost asking her whether her affections were engaged -- but as soon as she miss woodhouse appeared likely to join them he changed the subject and began talking about farming -- the second was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before emma came back from her visit the very last morning of his being at hartfield -- though when he first came in he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her during their conversation that though he must go to london it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all which was much more as emma felt than he had acknowledged to her the superior degree of confidence towards harriet which this one article marked gave her severe pain,1,1,0.9993100320260323
on the subject of the first of the two circumstances she did after a little reflection venture the following question might he not -- is not it possible that when enquiring as you thought into the state of your affections he might be alluding to mr martin -- he might have mr martin's interest in view but harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit,1,1,0.9589038008321124
mr martin no indeed -- there was not a hint of mr martin i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspected of it,1,1,0.9687883397896768
the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter feelings made the utmost exertion necessary on emma's side to enable her to say on reply,1,1,0.8610992066101811
how long had mr knightley been so dear to her as every feeling declared him now to be when had his influence such influence begun -- when had he succeeded to that place in her affection which frank churchill had once for a short period occupied -- she looked back she compared the two -- compared them as they had always stood in her estimation from the time of the latter's becoming known to her -- and as they must at any time have been compared by her had it -- oh had it by any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute the comparison -- she saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider mr knightley as infinitely the superior or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear she saw that in persuading herself in fancying in acting to the contrary she had been entirely under a delusion totally ignorant of her own heart -- and in short that she had never really cared for frank churchill at all,1,1,0.9960042067628709
this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection this was the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry which she reached and without being long in reaching it -- she was most sorrowfully indignant ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for mr knightley -- every other part of her mind was disgusting,1,1,0.9316204728134027
with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body's feelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body's destiny she was proved to have been universally mistaken and she had not quite done nothing -- for she had done mischief she had brought evil on harriet on herself and she too much feared on mr knightley -- were this most unequal of all connexions to take place on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning for his attachment she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of harriet's -- and even were this not the case he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly,1,1,0.9972154557185765
it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed and she hoped that when able to see them together again she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were -- she should see them henceforward with the closest observance and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here -- he was expected back every day the power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course in the meanwhile she resolved against seeing harriet -- it would do neither of them good it would do the subject no good to be talking of it farther -- she was resolved not to be convinced as long as she could doubt and yet had no authority for opposing harriet's confidence to talk would be only to irritate -- she wrote to her therefore kindly but decisively to beg that she would not at present come to hartfield acknowledging it to be her conviction that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better be avoided and hoping that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete-a-tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday -- harriet submitted and approved and was grateful,1,1,0.9945214979897976
yes i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him,1,1,0.9103208828492204
i am afraid returned emma sighing that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy,1,1,0.9154761048374891
such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs weston she thought well of frank in almost every respect and what was more she loved him very much and her defence was therefore earnest she talked with a great deal of reason and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for emma's attention it was soon gone to brunswick square or to donwell she forgot to attempt to listen and when mrs weston ended with we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come she was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged to answer at random before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for,1,1,0.9960838727137797
the evening of this day was very long and melancholy at hartfield the weather added what it could of gloom a cold stormy rain set in and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the wind was despoiling and the length of the day which only made such cruel sights the longer visible,1,1,0.5629418773759298
you are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and i must set you right -- i am not in want of that sort of compassion my blindness to what was going on led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier,1,1,0.8328081389524384
emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream was perhaps the most prominent feeling,1,1,0.7094865200138794
i cannot make speeches emma he soon resumed and in a tone of such sincere decided intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing -- if i loved you less i might be able to talk about it more but you know what i am -- you hear nothing but truth from me -- i have blamed you and lectured you and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it -- bear with the truths i would tell you now dearest emma as well as you have borne with them the manner perhaps may have as little to recommend them god knows i have been a very indifferent lover -- but you understand me -- yes you see you understand my feelings -- and will return them if you can at present i ask only to hear once to hear your voice,1,1,0.8816253646722898
while he spoke emma's mind was most busy and with all the wonderful velocity of thought had been able -- and yet without losing a word -- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole to see that harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless a mistake a delusion as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that harriet was nothing that she was every thing herself that what she had been saying relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings and that her agitation her doubts her reluctance her discouragement had been all received as discouragement from herself -- and not only was there time for these convictions with all their glow of attendant happiness there was time also to rejoice that harriet's secret had not escaped her and to resolve that it need not and should not -- it was all the service she could now render her poor friend for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to harriet as infinitely the most worthy of the two -- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever without vouchsafing any motive because he could not marry them both emma had it not she felt for harriet with pain and with contrition but no flight of generosity run mad opposing all that could be probable or reasonable entered her brain she had led her friend astray and it would be a reproach to her for ever but her judgment was as strong as her feelings and as strong as it had ever been before in reprobating any such alliance for him as most unequal and degrading her way was clear though not quite smooth -- she spoke then on being so entreated -- what did she say -- just what she ought of course a lady always does -- she said enough to shew there need not be despair -- and to invite him to say more himself he had despaired at one period he had received such an injunction to caution and silence as for the time crushed every hope -- she had begun by refusing to hear him -- the change had perhaps been somewhat sudden -- her proposal of taking another turn her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to might be a little extraordinary -- she felt its inconsistency but mr knightley was so obliging as to put up with it and seek no farther explanation,1,1,0.9944262671620486
he had found her agitated and low -- frank churchill was a villain -- he heard her declare that she had never loved him frank churchill's character was not desperate -- she was his own emma by hand and word when they returned into the house and if he could have thought of frank churchill then he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow,1,1,0.9797615735157016
as long as mr knightley remained with them emma's fever continued but when he was gone she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night which was the tax for such an evening she found one or two such very serious points to consider as made her feel that even her happiness must have some alloy her father -- and harriet she could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost was the question with respect to her father it was a question soon answered she hardly knew yet what mr knightley would ask but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father -- she even wept over the idea of it as a sin of thought while he lived it must be only an engagement but she flattered herself that if divested of the danger of drawing her away it might become an increase of comfort to him -- how to do her best by harriet was of more difficult decision -- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain how to make her any possible atonement how to appear least her enemy -- on these subjects her perplexity and distress were very great -- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it -- she could only resolve at last that she would still avoid a meeting with her and communicate all that need be told by letter that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from highbury and -- indulging in one scheme more -- nearly resolve that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to brunswick square -- isabella had been pleased with harriet and a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement -- she did not think it in harriet's nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety by the streets the shops and the children -- at any rate it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself from whom every thing was due a separation for the present an averting of the evil day when they must all be together again,1,1,0.9983456916275251
i have the greatest pleasure my dear emma in forwarding to you the enclosed i know what thorough justice you will do it and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect -- i think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again but i will not delay you by a long preface -- we are quite well -- this letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness i have been feeling lately -- i did not quite like your looks on tuesday but it was an ungenial morning and though you will never own being affected by weather i think every body feels a north-east wind -- i felt for your dear father very much in the storm of tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning but had the comfort of hearing last night by mr perry that it had not made him ill yours ever a w,1,1,0.957168633911858
nay nay read on -- you will find how very much he suffers,1,1,0.5016738947418156
she had engaged to go as governess to mrs smallridge's children -- a dear friend of mrs elton's -- a neighbour of maple grove and by the bye i wonder how mrs elton bears the disappointment,1,1,0.9936965480324705
well there is feeling here -- he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill -- certainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of her dearer much dearer than ever ' i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation -- he is a very liberal thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands -- happier than i deserve ' come he knows himself there miss woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune ' -- those were miss woodhouse's words were they -- and a fine ending -- and there is the letter the child of good fortune that was your name for him was it,1,1,0.9616925897992474
she promised however to think of it and pretty nearly promised moreover to think of it with the intention of finding it a very good scheme,1,1,0.8782116468884074
this proposal of his this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield -- the more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became his evils seemed to lessen her own advantages to increase their mutual good to outweigh every drawback such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her -- such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy,1,1,0.9723544165236722
mrs bates and mrs elton were together miss bates was out which accounted for the previous tranquillity emma could have wished mrs elton elsewhere but she was in a humour to have patience with every body and as mrs elton met her with unusual graciousness she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm,1,1,0.9972823881281342
i mentioned no names you will observe -- oh no cautious as a minister of state i managed it extremely well,1,1,0.6556513345324796
what are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr elton -- that will be a favour indeed for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits and mr elton's time is so engaged,1,1,0.957685513865466
emma would not have smiled for the world and only said is mr elton gone on foot to donwell -- he will have a hot walk,1,1,0.9042602865790599
nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied emma smiling -- but excuse me it must be thought of,1,1,0.8829295326088308
i am sure you were of use to me cried emma i was very often influenced rightly by you -- oftener than i would own at the time i am very sure you did me good and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is thirteen,1,1,0.9214634586922059
how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your saucy looks -- mr knightley i am going to do so-and-so papa says i may or i have miss taylor's leave' -- something which you knew i did not approve in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one,1,1,0.9616651400175126
my emma he means no such thing he only means --,1,1,0.8206085541467621
ah he cried i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be happy together i am amused by one part of john's letter -- did you notice it -- where he says that my information did not take him wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind,1,1,0.9656019457265254
he went to highbury the next morning and satisfied himself on that point he told her the news was not she like a daughter his eldest daughter -- he must tell her and miss bates being present it passed of course to mrs cole mrs perry and mrs elton immediately afterwards it was no more than the principals were prepared for they had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls how soon it would be over highbury and were thinking of themselves as the evening wonder in many a family circle with great sagacity,1,1,0.9981617048040287
good or bad said she quickly looking up in his face,1,0,0.1777423786671513
there is one subject he replied i hope but one on which we do not think alike he paused a moment again smiling with his eyes fixed on her face does nothing occur to you -- do not you recollect -- harriet smith,1,1,0.9252707600623168
i mean that he has done it answered mr knightley with smiling but determined decision and been accepted,1,1,0.871315242414611
the contrast between the countenance and air of mr knightley and robert martin was at this moment so strong to emma's feelings and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on harriet's side so fresh the sound of those words spoken with such emphasis no i hope i know better than to think of robert martin that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove in some measure premature it could not be otherwise,1,1,0.9804760351505623
and i am changed also for i am now very willing to grant you all harriet's good qualities i have taken some pains for your sake and for robert martin's sake whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her i have often talked to her a good deal you must have seen that i did sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martin's cause which was never the case but from all my observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life -- much of this i have no doubt she may thank you for,1,1,0.9892938701208612
he thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness,1,1,0.8613585562938275
the shame he answered is all mine or ought to be but is it possible that you had no suspicion -- i mean of late early i know you had none,1,0,0.4633247450006013
emma spoke her pity so very kindly that with a sudden accession of gay thought he cried,1,1,0.7831057098861104
but he laughed so heartily at the recollection that emma could not help saying,1,1,0.9053159120008993
true true he answered warmly no not true on your side you can have no superior but most true on mine -- she is a complete angel look at her is not she an angel in every gesture observe the turn of her throat observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father -- you will be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously that my uncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels they are to be new set i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head will not it be beautiful in her dark hair,1,1,0.5685506017932673
emma soon recollected and understood him and while she joined in the laugh it was evident from jane's countenance that she too was really hearing him though trying to seem deaf,1,1,0.9581380440575783
such an extraordinary dream of mine he cried i can never think of it without laughing -- she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse i see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown look at her do not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye -- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else though pretending to listen to the others,1,1,0.7279532775883456
he had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly but emma's feelings were chiefly with jane in the argument and on leaving randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men she felt that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill and really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more sensible of mr knightley's high superiority of character the happiness of this most happy day received its completion in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced,1,1,0.993006325356519
harriet necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins was less and less at hartfield which was not to be regretted -- the intimacy between her and emma must sink their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill and fortunately what ought to be and must be seemed already beginning and in the most gradual natural manner,1,1,0.9791510399893844
when first sounded on the subject he was so miserable that they were almost hopeless -- a second allusion indeed gave less pain -- he began to think it was to be and that he could not prevent it -- a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation still however he was not happy nay he appeared so much otherwise that his daughter's courage failed she could not bear to see him suffering to know him fancying himself neglected and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the mr knightleys that when once the event were over his distress would be soon over too she hesitated -- she could not proceed,1,1,0.9579943883173884
walter elliot born march 1 1760 married july 15 1784 elizabeth daughter of james stevenson esq of south park in the county of gloucester by which lady who died 1800 he has issue elizabeth born june 1 1785 anne born august 9 1787 a still-born son november 5 1789 mary born november 20 1791,1,1,0.7436778519172131
sir walter has resented it as the head of the house he felt that he ought to have been consulted especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand for they must have been seen together he observed once at tattersall's and twice in the lobby of the house of commons his disapprobation was expressed but apparently very little regarded mr elliot had attempted no apology and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family as sir walter considered him unworthy of it all acquaintance between them had ceased,1,1,0.9587476195459573
but now another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these her father was growing distressed for money she knew that when he now took up the baronetage it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of mr shepherd his agent from his thoughts the kellynch property was good but not equal to sir walter's apprehension of the state required in its possessor while lady elliot lived there had been method moderation and economy which had just kept him within his income but with her had died all such right-mindedness and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it it had not been possible for him to spend less he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot was imperiously called on to do but blameless as he was he was not only growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing of it so often that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partially from his daughter he had given her some hints of it the last spring in town he had gone so far even as to say can we retrench does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench and elizabeth to do her justice had in the first ardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done and had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off some unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to anne as had been the usual yearly custom but these measures however good in themselves were insufficient for the real extent of the evil the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy she felt herself ill-used and unfortunate as did her father and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne,1,1,0.9907814679981508
their two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived in the neighbouring market town and lady russell were called to advise them and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride,1,1,0.8624599757247762
lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it much serious consideration she was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles she was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour but she was as desirous of saving sir walter's feelings as solicitous for the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be she was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding she had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking rational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry she had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them herself the widow of only a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due and sir walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance an attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her very dear friend the father of anne and her sisters was as being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties,1,1,0.9944155632097544
if we can persuade your father to all this said lady russell looking over her paper much may be done if he will adopt these regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hope we may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle what will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families have done or ought to do there will be nothing singular in his case and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering as it always does of our conduct i have great hope of prevailing we must be serious and decided for after all the person who has contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father there is still more due to the character of an honest man,1,1,0.9225545247062515
quit kellynch hall the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter's retrenching and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side it did not appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support in any other place sir walter might judge for himself and would be looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household,1,1,0.9719310530112862
lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth and seemed to love her rather because she would love her than because elizabeth deserved it she had never received from her more than outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry against previous inclination she had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience but always in vain elizabeth would go her own way and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in this selection of mrs clay turning from the society of so deserving a sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility,1,1,0.9965043630687159
i must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspaper that the present juncture is much in our favour this peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore they will be all wanting a home could not be a better time sir walter for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants many a noble fortune has been made during the war if a rich admiral were to come in our way sir walter --,1,1,0.8838665072973003
as to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier,1,1,0.9745416249210711
the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it,1,1,0.6965362288289574
mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's family and mentioned a place and anne after the little pause which followed added --,1,1,0.8779122615481739
then i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery,1,0,0.45036223529580144
how eloquent could anne elliot have been how eloquent at least were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful confidence in futurity against that over-anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust providence she had been forced into prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning,1,1,0.9629555237895685
with all these circumstances recollections and feelings she could not hear that captain wentworth's sister was likely to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea she often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts and their business no evil she was assisted however by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it she could do justice to the superiority of lady russell's motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral croft's really taking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her of the past being known to those three only among her connexions by whom no syllable she believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his the brother only with whom he had been residing had received any information of their short-lived engagement that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover a single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creature's having heard of it from him,1,1,0.9972892220903807
to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least better than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily agreed to stay,1,1,0.9315435356046062
anne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless of doing good elizabeth though resenting the suspicion might yet be made observant by it,1,1,0.913594040600305
the last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw sir walter miss elliot and mrs clay to bath the party drove off in very good spirits sir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves and anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity to the lodge where she was to spend the first week,1,1,0.9728087438220722
her friend was not in better spirits than herself lady russell felt this break-up of the family exceedingly their respectability was as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne accordingly their removal was made together and anne was set down at uppercross cottage in the first stage of lady russell's journey,1,1,0.9917150741986801
yes i made the best of it i always do but i was very far from well at the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning very unfit to be left alone i am sure suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way and not able to ring the bell so lady russell would not get out i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer,1,1,0.8407710523458553
oh yes i went i was very well yesterday nothing at all the matter with me till this morning it would have been strange if i had not gone,1,1,0.6489162392966501
oh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister however we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when we have that over we can enjoy our walk,1,1,0.7239070916774086
the musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration perhaps of improvement the father and mother were in the old english style and the young people in the new mr and mrs musgrove were a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable not much educated and not at all elegant their children had more modern minds and manners there was a numerous family but the only two grown up excepting charles were henrietta and louisa young ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands of other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry their dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty their spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant they were of consequence at home and favourites abroad anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together that good-humoured mutual affection of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters,1,1,0.9922574828808263
they were received with great cordiality nothing seemed amiss on the side of the great house family which was generally as anne very well knew the least to blame the half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprised at the end of it to have their walking party joined by both the miss musgroves at mary's particular invitation,1,1,0.9755515301617576
anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross to learn that a removal from one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea she had never been staying there before without being struck by it or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs which at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her for certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove so miss anne sir walter and your sister are gone and what part of bath do you think they will settle in and this without much waiting for an answer or in the young ladies' addition of i hope we shall be in bath in the winter but remember papa if we do go we must be in a good situation none of your queen squares for us or in the anxious supplement from mary of -- upon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away to be happy at bath,1,1,0.9961565470335035
she played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves but having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents to sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was little thought of only out of civility or to refresh the others as she was well aware she knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation excepting one short period of her life she had never since the age of fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother known the happiness of being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world and mr and mrs musgrove's fond partiality for their own daughters' performance and total indifference to any other person's gave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification for her own,1,1,0.994081857232191
mrs croft though neither tall nor fat had a squareness uprightness and vigour of form which gave importance to her person she had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty her manners were open easy and decided like one who had no distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without any approach to coarseness however or any want of good humour anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased her especially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft's side to give a bias of any sort she was quite easy on that head and consequently full of strength and courage till for a moment electrified by mrs croft's suddenly saying --,1,1,0.9857813122928434
anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotion she certainly had not,1,1,0.8949671532858491
perhaps you may not have heard that he is married added mrs croft,1,1,0.9452077201374499
in each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships that it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that mrs musgrove should have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection of the name of wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur,1,1,0.9198702093003037
the resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening,1,1,0.7062583274402029
the same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came with their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiries and mr musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir could add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only be sorry to think that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy to give him the meeting oh no as to leaving the little boy both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought and anne in the joy of the escape could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs,1,1,0.9603559315227789
charles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination the child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced to captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour but in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away only think if anything should happen,1,1,0.9916055737551893
the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those of the other house and on the morrow the difference was so great that mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when charles came in to say that they were just setting off that he was come for his dogs that his sisters were following with captain wentworth his sisters meaning to visit mary and the child and captain wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient and though charles had answered for the child's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient captain wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice,1,1,0.984269475387007
on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense for after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary --,1,1,0.9850339175384589
captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was so attentive to me henrietta asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not have known you again ',1,1,0.9346126360611655
mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister's in a common way but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound,1,1,0.953399548857105
when he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind there was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party and he was very much questioned and especially by the two miss musgroves who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner of living on board daily regulations food hours c and their surprise at his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule which reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there were or any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use,1,1,0.9331300109183812
your first was the asp i remember we will look for the asp,1,1,0.5152699348695691
the admiralty he continued entertain themselves now and then with sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed but they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed,1,0,0.44642820086644824
to be sure you did what should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together if a man had not a wife he soon wants to be afloat again,1,1,0.645780849499733
the girls were now hunting for the laconia and captain wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate and present non-commissioned class observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had,1,1,0.7693739375751406
ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all so much for her sake i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean,1,1,0.8498560355261943
oh frederick but i cannot believe it of you -- all idle refinement -- women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall with a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether,1,1,0.8805041802462599
my dear frederick you are talking quite idly pray what would become of us poor sailors' wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings,1,1,0.6052461490200772
now i have done cried captain wentworth when once married people begin to attack me with -- oh you will think very differently when you are married ' i can only say no i shall not ' and then they say again yes you will ' and there is an end of it,1,1,0.8554734841006654
the evening ended with dancing on its being proposed anne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad to be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved,1,1,0.9483384597703122
captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay as long as he liked being as thoroughly the object of the admiral's fraternal kindness as of his wife's he had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire and visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions of uppercross induced him to put this off there was so much of friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitching in his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all the charms and perfections of edward's wife upon credit a little longer,1,1,0.9840234525055144
well i am very glad indeed but i always thought you would have it i always thought you sure it did not appear to me that -- in short you know dr shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promise is he coming louisa,1,1,0.8504497088766068
she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain there to satisfy her patient and thus they continued a few minutes when to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule she hoped on turning her head to see the master of the house but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy -- charles hayter probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne,1,1,0.9830576698031511
one morning about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth being gone a-shooting together as the sisters in the cottage were sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window by the sisters from the mansion-house,1,1,0.9347193982753819
what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister they meant to take a long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills they talked of coming into this side of the country i wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day oh it does happen very often i assure you but my sister makes nothing of it she would as lieve be tossed out as not,1,1,0.7005365739402012
winthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before them an indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farm-yard,1,0,0.45323456182597166
charles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt now that he was so near and very evidently though more fearfully trying to induce his wife to go too but this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answered oh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good and in short her look and manner declared that go she would not,1,1,0.980465125281782
she would indeed i am almost ashamed to say it,1,1,0.7736089029471931
happy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand after the hints you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations the last time i was in company with him i need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on i see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this your sister is an amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness i see if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can but this no doubt you have been always doing it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on you are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody may sway it let those who would be happy be firm here is a nut said he catching one down from an upper bough to exemplify a beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength has outlived all the storms of autumn not a puncture not a weak spot anywhere this nut he continued with playful solemnity while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of then returning to his former earnest tone -- my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life she will cherish all her present powers of mind,1,1,0.9496427496254163
as soon as she could she went after mary and having found and walked back with her to their former station by the stile felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected and once more in motion together her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give,1,1,0.9440718267172189
everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth nothing could be plainer and where many divisions were necessary or even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two in a long strip of meadow land where there was ample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties and to that party of the three which boasted least animation and least complaisance anne necessarily belonged she joined charles and mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charles's other arm but charles though in very good humour with her was out of temper with his wife mary had shewn herself disobliging to him and was now to reap the consequence which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch and when mary began to complain of it and lament her being ill-used according to custom in being on the hedge side while anne was never incommoded on the other he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along at all,1,1,0.9491785225362169
this long meadow bordered a lane which their footpath at the end of it was to cross and when the party had all reached the gate of exit the carriage advancing in the same direction which had been some time heard was just coming up and proved to be admiral croft's gig he and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired it would save her a full mile and they were going through uppercross the invitation was general and generally declined the miss musgroves were not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being asked before any of the others or what louisa called the elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise,1,1,0.9712372687846866
the walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an opposite stile and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister the something might be guessed by its effects,1,1,0.7296615262361626
miss elliot i am sure you are tired cried mrs croft do let us have the pleasure of taking you home here is excellent room for three i assure you if we were all like you i believe we might sit four you must indeed you must,1,1,0.9435513376107508
anne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline she was not allowed to proceed the admiral's kind urgency came in support of his wife's they would not be refused they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner and captain wentworth without saying a word turned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage,1,1,0.9463887828968556
her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given they had travelled half their way along the rough lane before she was quite awake to what they said she then found them talking of frederick,1,1,0.6463068469972101
we had better not talk about it my dear replied mrs croft pleasantly for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together i had known you by character however long before,1,1,0.9895343746245027
very good humoured unaffected girls indeed said mrs croft in a tone of calmer praise such as made anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother and a very respectable family one could not be connected with better people my dear admiral that post we shall certainly take that post,1,1,0.9722634198070682
and yet said anne to herself as they now moved forward to meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart than i have i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever he is younger than i am younger in feeling if not in fact younger as a man he will rally again and be happy with another,1,1,0.7993966745779286
i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion i wish lady russell lived at uppercross and were intimate with dr shirley i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody i always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything i am afraid of her as i have told you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour at uppercross,1,1,0.9875848730986385
anne was amused by henrietta's manner of being grateful and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of henrietta's views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the musgrove family she had only time however for a general answer and a wish that such another woman were at uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town they were all at her disposal,1,1,0.996103509832126
after attending louisa through her business and loitering about a little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room had nearly run against the very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment she had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves and determined that a well-looking groom who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back should be his servant both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves and this second meeting short as it was also proved again by the gentleman's looks that he thought hers very lovely and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was a man of exceedingly good manners he seemed about thirty and though not handsome had an agreeable person anne felt that she should like to know who he was,1,1,0.954464252415428
elliot many had looked on each other and many had repeated the name before all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity of a waiter,1,1,0.5403971769777793
no ma'am he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day,1,1,0.7880074090035335
anne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated but as what ought to be suppressed the offence which had been given her father many years back she knew elizabeth's particular share in it she suspected and that mr elliot's idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt mary never wrote to bath herself all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth fell on anne,1,1,0.9913152464732866
anne found captain benwick again drawing near her lord byron's dark blue seas could not fail of being brought forward by their present view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible it was soon drawn perforce another way,1,1,0.9213596403959733
captain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his arms looking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of silence she is dead she is dead screamed mary catching hold of her husband and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable and in another moment henrietta sinking under the conviction lost her senses too and would have fallen on the steps but for captain benwick and anne who caught and supported her between them,1,1,0.84203331752461
go to him go to him cried anne for heaven's sake go to him i can support her myself leave me and go to him rub her hands rub her temples here are salts take them take them,1,0,0.4900832755754033
by this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the cobb and many were collected near them to be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine as the first report to some of the best-looking of these good people henrietta was consigned for though partially revived she was quite helpless and in this manner anne walking by her side and charles attending to his wife they set forward treading back with feelings unutterable the ground which so lately so very lately and so light of heart they had passed along,1,1,0.8285873879963764
it now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done as to their general situation they were now able to speak to each other and consult that louisa must remain where she was however distressing to her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble did not admit a doubt her removal was impossible the harvilles silenced all scruples and as much as they could all gratitude they had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect captain benwick must give up his room to them and get another bed elsewhere and the whole was settled they were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more and yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maid's room or swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay though with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harville's care entirely mrs harville was a very experienced nurse and her nursery-maid who had lived with her long and gone about with her everywhere was just such another between these two she could want no possible attendance by day or night and all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible,1,1,0.9948908302176884
the plan had reached this point when anne coming quietly down from louisa's room could not but hear what followed for the parlour door was open,1,1,0.8570625263862671
one thing more and all seemed arranged though it was rather desirable that mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay yet the time required by the uppercross horses to take them back would be a dreadful extension of suspense and captain wentworth proposed and charles musgrove agreed that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn and leave mr musgrove's carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of louisa's night,1,1,0.9962002750648373
captain wentworth was on the watch for them and a chaise and four in waiting stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other the change in his countenance the astonishment the expressions begun and suppressed with which charles was listened to made but a mortifying reception of anne or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa,1,1,0.983891924013775
don't talk of it don't talk of it he cried oh god that i had not given way to her at the fatal moment had i done as i ought but so eager and so resolute dear sweet louisa,1,1,0.5877857726902771
i have been considering what we had best do she must not appear at first she could not stand it i have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her while i go in and break it to mr and mrs musgrove do you think this is a good plan,1,1,0.9471495588717489
charles was to return to lyme the same afternoon and his father had at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent it would be going only to multiply trouble to the others and increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon a chaise was sent for from crewkherne and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family one who having brought up all the children and seen the very last the lingering and long-petted master harry sent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her and who consequently was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa vague wishes of getting sarah thither had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta but without anne it would hardly have been resolved on and found practicable so soon,1,1,0.9870522757202079
anne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded what should they do without her they were wretched comforters for one another and so much was said in this way that anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once she had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would go go to-morrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings as it suited and there remain till dear louisa could be moved they must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with they might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children and in short they were so happy in the decision that anne was delighted with what she had done and felt that she could not spend her last morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations and sending them off at an early hour though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence,1,1,0.99360240721627
anne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell's house in september it had not been necessary and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade and escape from her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the lodge and to gladden the eyes of its mistress,1,1,0.9580624897617827
mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion receiving her in that house there was particular attention,1,1,0.9930041820825753
the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday the first time since the accident had brought anne the last note which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of had staid a few hours and then returned again to lyme and without any present intention of quitting it any more he had enquired after her she found particularly had expressed his hope of miss elliot's not being the worse for her exertions and had spoken of those exertions as great this was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done,1,1,0.9946590609898762
the next time you write to your good father miss elliot pray give him my compliments and mrs croft's and say that we are settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find with the place the breakfast-room chimney smokes a little i grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard which may not happen three times a winter and take it altogether now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge there is not one that we like better than this pray say so with my compliments he will be glad to hear it,1,1,0.816881555100483
lady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present for when it was returned the crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions in the north of the county and probably might not be at home again before lady russell would be removing to bath,1,1,0.9923320564255196
i must see captain benwick before i decide said lady russell smiling,1,1,0.9347938958338057
oh as to being anne's acquaintance said mary i think he is rather my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight,1,1,0.9843398805038394
there we differ mary said anne i think lady russell would like him i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner,1,1,0.9737169812510705
with regard to captain wentworth though anne hazarded no enquiries there was voluntary communication sufficient his spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected as louisa improved he had improved and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week he had not seen louisa and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview that he did not press for it at all and on the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days till her head was stronger he had talked of going down to plymouth for a week and wanted to persuade captain benwick to go with him but as charles maintained to the last captain benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch,1,1,0.9981703029013893
lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hayter nor captain wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in,1,1,0.9949395426810682
anne judging from her own temperament would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves which louisa's illness must have so greatly shaken but mrs musgrove who got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially again and again for all her attentions to them concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing with a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone through nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home,1,1,0.9927526535578827
i hope i shall remember in future said lady russell as soon as they were reseated in the carriage not to call at uppercross in the christmas holidays,1,1,0.9262262205947135
elizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest mr elliot was in bath he had called in camden place had called a second time a third had been pointedly attentive if elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect this was very wonderful if it were true and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to mary of his being a man whom she had no wish to see she had a great wish to see him if he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree,1,1,0.992535410033043
the circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of much extenuation this was an article not to be entered on by himself but a very intimate friend of his a colonel wallis a highly respectable man perfectly the gentleman and not an ill-looking man sir walter added who was living in very good style in marlborough buildings and had at his own particular request been admitted to their acquaintance through mr elliot had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage which made a material difference in the discredit of it,1,1,0.9860454580325093
anne listened but without quite understanding it allowances large allowances she knew must be made for the ideas of those who spoke she heard it all under embellishment all that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators still however she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared in mr elliot's wishing after an interval of so many years to be well received by them in a worldly view he had nothing to gain by being on terms with sir walter nothing to risk by a state of variance in all probability he was already the richer of the two and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title a sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man why should it be an object to him she could only offer one solution it was perhaps for elizabeth's sake there might really have been a liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way and now that he could afford to please himself he might mean to pay his addresses to her elizabeth was certainly very handsome with well-bred elegant manners and her character might never have been penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but in public and when very young himself how her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice or too observant if elizabeth were his object and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so and that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea seemed apparent by a glance or two between them while mr elliot's frequent visits were talked of,1,1,0.9983038570696771
it was a reference to the future which anne after a little observation felt she must submit to she could determine nothing at present in that house elizabeth must be first and she was in the habit of such general observance as miss elliot that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible mr elliot too it must be remembered had not been a widower seven months a little delay on his side might be very excusable in fact anne could never see the crape round his hat without fearing that she was the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginations for though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved,1,1,0.9918811296779415
anne was ashamed had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created but they were nothing there was no superiority of manner accomplishment or understanding lady dalrymple had acquired the name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody miss carteret with still less to say was so plain and so awkward that she would never have been tolerated in camden place but for her birth,1,1,0.9892033403095745
yes sighed anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance i suppose smiling i have more pride than any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them,1,1,0.9678148085796736
i love your indignation said he it is very natural but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot you talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different in one point i am sure my dear cousin he continued speaking lower though there was no one else in the room in one point i am sure we must feel alike we must feel that every addition to your father's society among his equals or superiors may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him,1,1,0.9116600487889895
the visit was paid their acquaintance re-established their interest in each other more than re-kindled the first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion twelve years were gone since they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined twelve years had changed anne from the blooming silent unformed girl of fifteen to the elegant little woman of seven-and-twenty with every beauty except bloom and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle and twelve years had transformed the fine-looking well-grown miss hamilton in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority into a poor infirm helpless widow receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times,1,1,0.9417068585793945
anne saw the misery of such feelings the husband had not been what he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved it was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith she shook it off and soon added in a different tone --,1,1,0.9786567509480227
anne had called several times on her friend before the existence of such a person was known in camden place at last it became necessary to speak of her sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay returned one morning from laura place with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple for the same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that evening in westgate buildings she was not sorry for the excuse they were only asked she was sure because lady dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her and she declined on her own account with great alacrity -- she was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow they were not much interested in anything relative to anne but still there were questions enough asked to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was and elizabeth was disdainful and sir walter severe,1,1,0.9958293064188398
anne kept her appointment the others kept theirs and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening she had been the only one of the set absent for sir walter and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship's service themselves but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others and had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot and mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early and lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from lady russell to her its greatest interest must be in having been very much talked of between her friend and mr elliot in having been wished for regretted and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause her kind compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow sick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot he thought her a most extraordinary young woman in her temper manners mind a model of female excellence he could meet even lady russell in a discussion of her merits and anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create,1,1,0.9992040146501932
i am no match-maker as you well know said lady russell being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together a most suitable connection everybody must consider it but i think it might be a very happy one,1,1,0.9589052322424659
lady russell let this pass and only said in rejoinder i own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch the future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother's place succeeding to all her rights and all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be the highest possible gratification to me you are your mother's self in countenance and disposition and if i might be allowed to fancy you such as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessing in the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued my dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life,1,1,0.9876133281419301
lady russell saw either less or more than her young friend for she saw nothing to excite distrust she could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church in the course of the following autumn,1,1,0.9725856235511329
anne could listen no longer she could not even have told how the poor admiral's complexion escaped her letter engrossed her it had been begun several days back,1,1,0.9509073324262967
my dear anne -- i make no apology for my silence because i know how little people think of letters in such a place as bath you must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross which as you well know affords little to write about we have had a very dull christmas mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays i do not reckon the hayters as anybody the holidays however are over at last i believe no children ever had such long ones i am sure i had not the house was cleared yesterday except of the little harvilles but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home mrs harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long i do not understand it they are not at all nice children in my opinion but mrs musgrove seems to like them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren what dreadful weather we have had it may not be felt in bath with your nice pavements but in the country it is of some consequence i have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january except charles hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome between ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme as long as louisa it would have kept her a little out of his way the carriage is gone to-day to bring louisa and the harvilles to-morrow we are not asked to dine with them however till the day after mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey which is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow i am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable and wish i could be acquainted with him too but i have my usual luck i am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on always the last of my family to be noticed what an immense time mrs clay has been staying with elizabeth does she never mean to go away but perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited let me know what you think of this i do not expect my children to be asked you know i can leave them at the great house very well for a month or six weeks i have this moment heard that the crofts are going to bath almost immediately they think the admiral gouty charles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility to give me any notice or of offering to take anything i do not think they improve at all as neighbours we see nothing of them and this is really an instance of gross inattention charles joins me in love and everything proper yours affectionately,1,1,0.9984141240944248
mary need not have feared her sister's being in any degree prepared for the news she had never in her life been more astonished captain benwick and louisa musgrove it was almost too wonderful for belief and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questions of the moment happily for her they were not many sir walter wanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in but had little curiosity beyond,1,1,0.9973666236442149
they come on the admiral's account he is thought to be gouty,1,1,0.5919245816956348
gout and decrepitude said sir walter poor old gentleman,1,1,0.6139612437920012
the conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been sensible of captain wentworth's merits could be allowed to prefer another man there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it certainly nothing to be regretted no it was not regret which made anne's heart beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate they were too much like joy senseless joy,1,1,0.9866825268438754
the crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street perfectly to sir walter's satisfaction he was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more about the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him,1,1,0.9535683186160964
anne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself but it so happened that one morning about a week or ten days after the croft's arrival it suited her best to leave her friend or her friend's carriage in the lower part of the town and return alone to camden place and in walking up milsom street she had the good fortune to meet with the admiral he was standing by himself at a printshop window with his hands behind him in earnest contemplation of some print and she not only might have passed him unseen but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice when he did perceive and acknowledge her however it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour ha is it you thank you thank you this is treating me like a friend here i am you see staring at a picture i can never get by this shop without stopping but what a thing here is by way of a boat do look at it did you ever see the like what queer fellows your fine painters must be to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that and yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks and mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment which they certainly must be i wonder where that boat was built laughing heartily i would not venture over a horsepond in it well turning away now where are you bound can i go anywhere for you or with you can i be of any use,1,1,0.7538153410677888
that i will with all my heart and farther too yes yes we will have a snug walk together and i have something to tell you as we go along there take my arm that's right i do not feel comfortable if i have not a woman there lord what a boat it is taking a last look at the picture as they began to be in motion,1,0,0.3137579474091486
yes i have presently but here comes a friend captain brigden i shall only say how d'ye do ' as we pass however i shall not stop how d'ye do ' brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife she poor soul is tied by the leg she has a blister on one of her heels as large as a three-shilling piece if you look across the street you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother shabby fellows both of them i am glad they are not on this side of the way sophy cannot bear them they played me a pitiful trick once got away with some of my best men i will tell you the whole story another time there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson look he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife ah the peace has come too soon for that younker poor old sir archibald how do you like bath miss elliot it suits us very well we are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets full of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat and then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings and draw in our chairs and are snug as if we were at kellynch ay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal we do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way,1,0,0.29203917143229313
this was an opportunity which anne could not resist she said therefore i hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain wentworth's letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy it did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him and louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally and without violence i hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man,1,1,0.9901904554956906
not at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end,1,0,0.26703337322672754
mr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay they were in milsom street it began to rain not much but enough to make shelter desirable for women and quite enough to make it very desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in lady dalrymple's carriage which was seen waiting at a little distance she anne and mrs clay therefore turned into molland's while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple to request her assistance he soon joined them again successful of course lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home and would call for them in a few minutes,1,1,0.9953443215220562
she hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas alas she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet,1,1,0.7035627981424378
a day or two passed without producing anything the theatre or the rooms where he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough for the elliots whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties in which they were getting more and more engaged and anne wearied of such a state of stagnation sick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried was quite impatient for the concert evening it was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple of course they must attend it was really expected to be a good one and captain wentworth was very fond of music if she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should be satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred elizabeth had turned from him lady russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention,1,1,0.9903667386377767
anne was startled and confused but after standing in a moment's suspense was obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry away,1,1,0.8725023394817042
sir walter his two daughters and mrs clay were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening and as lady dalrymple must be waited for they took their station by one of the fires in the octagon room but hardly were they so settled when the door opened again and captain wentworth walked in alone anne was the nearest to him and making yet a little advance she instantly spoke he was preparing only to bow and pass on but her gentle how do you do brought him out of the straight line to stand near her and make enquiries in return in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground their being in the back ground was a support to anne she knew nothing of their looks and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done,1,1,0.9462870318832793
while they were speaking a whispering between her father and elizabeth caught her ear she could not distinguish but she must guess the subject and on captain wentworth's making a distant bow she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself this though late and reluctant and ungracious was yet better than nothing and her spirits improved,1,1,0.9764876673782737
after talking however of the weather and bath and the concert their conversation began to flag and so little was said at last that she was expecting him to go every moment but he did not he seemed in no hurry to leave her and presently with renewed spirit with a little smile a little glow he said --,1,1,0.7912778668923566
he stopped a sudden recollection seemed to occur and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening anne's cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground after clearing his throat however he proceeded thus --,1,1,0.8245200280365249
these were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him without even trying to discern him when their places were determined on and they were all properly arranged she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was not her eye could not reach him and the concert being just opening she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way,1,1,0.8780651943952212
this said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words for certainly the sense of an italian love-song must not be talked of but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend to understand the language i am a very poor italian scholar,1,0,0.3855384033711955
yes yes i see you are i see you know nothing of the matter you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear comprehensible elegant english you need not say anything more of your ignorance here is complete proof,1,0,0.2964501766991305
when she could give another glance he had moved away he could not have come nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in but she would rather have caught his eye,1,1,0.709213093229692
he did not come however anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance but he never came the anxious interval wore away unproductively the others returned the room filled again benches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed to anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth once more without the interchange of one friendly look,1,1,0.9591157127518353
such was her situation with a vacant space at hand when captain wentworth was again in sight she saw him not far off he saw her too yet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her she felt that something must be the matter the change was indubitable the difference between his present air and what it had been in the octagon room was strikingly great why was it she thought of her father of lady russell could there have been any unpleasant glances he began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captain wentworth of uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing and in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over anne replied and spoke in defence of the performance so well and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance improved and he replied again with almost a smile they talked for a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down towards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round it came from mr elliot he begged her pardon but she must be applied to to explain italian again miss carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung anne could not refuse but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit,1,1,0.9900681444154217
jealousy of mr elliot it was the only intelligible motive captain wentworth jealous of her affection could she have believed it a week ago three hours ago for a moment the gratification was exquisite but alas there were very different thoughts to succeed how was such jealousy to be quieted how was the truth to reach him how in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations would he ever learn of her real sentiments it was misery to think of mr elliot's attentions their evil was incalculable,1,1,0.9831123392503802
the little durands were there i conclude said she with their mouths open to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed they never miss a concert,1,1,0.5379994628131114
old lady mary maclean i need not ask after her she never misses i know and you must have seen her she must have been in your own circle for as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur round the orchestra of course,1,1,0.8017133401860793
and such being the case continued mrs smith after a short pause i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning it is really very good of you to come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time,1,1,0.9177785689172805
mr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised a moment's reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under she caught it instantaneously and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added more composedly are you acquainted with mr elliot,1,1,0.9702647350966392
i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you replied anne but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion you must consider me only as mr elliot's relation if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me,1,1,0.9705051531202622
i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon i ought to have waited for official information but now my dear miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak next week to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliot's good fortune,1,1,0.9679043887561813
now how i do wish i understood you how i do wish i knew what you were at i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment occurs till it does come you know we women never mean to have anybody it is a thing of course among us that every man is refused till he offers but why should you be cruel let me plead for my -- present friend i cannot call him but for my former friend where can you look for a more suitable match where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man let me recommend mr elliot i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis,1,1,0.9300181307274121
she stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much but less would hardly have been sufficient mrs smith would hardly have believed so soon in mr elliot's failure but from the perception of there being a somebody else as it was she instantly submitted and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and anne eager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smith should have fancied she was to marry mr elliot where she could have received the idea or from whom she could have heard it,1,1,0.9963720258365804
no i thank you no certainly not in the warmth of the moment and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances but not now no i thank you i have nothing to trouble you with,1,1,0.8436829155284872
indeed then do tell me what he was at that time of life i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man was he at all such as he appears now,1,1,0.7333135069570829
i have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smith's answer given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity they were both silent mrs smith very thoughtful at last --,1,1,0.9893529280956184
such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow and mrs smith observing the high colour in her face said --,1,1,0.9405933971721269
only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you so says my historian at least is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west ' to use her own words without knowing it to be you,1,1,0.8366868507496447
here mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to say and she continued --,1,1,0.962892007465489
there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation she had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the west indies which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures and this property though not large would be enough to make her comparatively rich but there was nobody to stir in it mr elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money she had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law this was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances that a little trouble in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims was hard to bear,1,1,0.9706699430421974
my dear was mrs smith's reply there was nothing else to be done i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him than if he had been your husband my heart bled for you as i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless he was very unkind to his first wife they were wretched together but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her i was willing to hope that you must fare better,1,1,0.9735876404298603
oh cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints however when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and sir walter together they appear to so much advantage in company with each other each behaving so pleasantly mr elliot looking up with so much respect,1,1,0.9780808044064854
my dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyes and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence,1,1,0.888070759739473
to be sure he is nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself i have a great value for benwick and when one can but get him to talk he has plenty to say his reading has done him no harm for he has fought as well as read he is a brave fellow i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before we had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father's great barns and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since,1,1,0.675772852853897
the visit passed off altogether in high good humour mary was in excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law's carriage with four horses and with her own complete independence of camden place that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house as they were detailed to her she had no demands on her father or sister and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing-rooms,1,1,0.9729691542910825
her plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes but anne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hart to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn with an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form,1,1,0.922422296622123
no cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure you he was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back till to-morrow,1,1,0.9443997969309587
do come anne cried mary come and look yourself you will be too late if you do not make haste they are parting they are shaking hands he is turning away not know mr elliot indeed you seem to have forgot all about lyme,1,1,0.8392103380222349
well mother i have done something for you that you will like i have been to the theatre and secured a box for to-morrow night a'n't i a good boy i know you love a play and there is room for us all it holds nine i have engaged captain wentworth anne will not be sorry to join us i am sure we all like a play have not i done well mother,1,1,0.7528909550566046
phoo phoo replied charles what's an evening party never worth remembering your father might have asked us to dinner i think if he had wanted to see us you may do as you like but i shall go to the play,1,1,0.7177519942794268
charles and mary still talked on in the same style he half serious and half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she invariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting to make it known that however determined to go to camden place herself she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play without her mrs musgrove interposed,1,1,0.9737823887821573
it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would,1,1,0.8596711272293382
you were not formerly i know you did not use to like cards but time makes many changes,1,1,0.5309129601759881
their preparations however were stopped short alarming sounds were heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open for sir walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give a general chill anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same the comfort the freedom the gaiety of the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence or insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister how mortifying to feel that it was so,1,1,0.9488605404801596
her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular captain wentworth was acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before she even addressed him once and looked at him more than once elizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure the sequel explained it after the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves to-morrow evening to meet a few friends no formal party it was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had provided herself the miss elliot at home were laid on the table with a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and one card more decidedly for captain wentworth the truth was that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his the past was nothing the present was that captain wentworth would move about well in her drawing-room the card was pointedly given and sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared,1,1,0.9882847121542803
the party separated the gentlemen had their own pursuits the ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while anne belonged to them she was earnestly begged to return and dine and give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more and fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose,1,1,0.9802475203076212
we will write the letter we were talking of harville now if you will give me materials,1,1,0.652692635688619
yes dear ma'am said mrs croft or an uncertain engagement an engagement which may be long to begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying i hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parents should prevent as far as they can,1,1,0.9568662708859756
look here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying a small miniature painting do you know who that is,1,0,0.3292070261419345
no replied anne in a low feeling voice that i can easily believe,1,1,0.7465680233818335
not quite a few lines more i shall have done in five minutes,1,1,0.6114239093901045
i must go uncertain of my fate but i shall return hither or follow your party as soon as possible a word a look will be enough to decide whether i enter your father's house this evening or never,1,1,0.526359798946777
by all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directly and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself charles ring and order a chair she must not walk,1,1,0.8207667905080892
i hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised,1,1,0.9286040353492112
are you going as high as belmont are you going near camden place because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place and give anne your arm to her father's door she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help and i ought to be at that fellow's in the market place he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance by his description a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine which you shot with one day round winthrop,1,0,0.4844632019770134
anne smiled and let it pass it was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach it is something for a woman to be assured in her eight-and-twentieth year that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be the result not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment,1,1,0.9597643757341773
perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus he replied but i could not i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your character i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year i could think of you only as one who had yielded who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery i had no reason to believe her of less authority now the force of habit was to be added,1,1,0.879106902308536
i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now to me she was in the place of a parent do not mistake me however i am not saying that she did not err in her advice it was perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity give such advice but i mean that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up because i should have suffered in my conscience i have now as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman's portion,1,1,0.9370818113808345
sir walter indeed though he had no affection for anne and no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion was very far from thinking it a bad match for her on the contrary when he saw more of captain wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight and eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claims and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank and all this assisted by his well-sounding name enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen with a very good grace for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour,1,1,0.9730941658884467
of all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance it was creditable to have a sister married and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn and as her own sister must be better than her husband's sisters it was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than either captain benwick or charles hayter she had something to suffer perhaps when they came into contact again in seeing anne restored to the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette but she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolation anne had no uppercross hall before her no landed estate no headship of a family and if they could but keep captain wentworth from being made a baronet she would not change situations with anne,1,1,0.9993116279408295
the news of his cousins anne's engagement burst on mr elliot most unexpectedly it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness his best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness which a son-in-law's rights would have given but though discomfited and disappointed he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment he soon quitted bath and on mrs clay's quitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established under his protection in london it was evident how double a game he had been playing and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman at least,1,1,0.9906622935693231
it cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of their deception in her they had their great cousins to be sure to resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others without being flattered and followed in turn is but a state of half enjoyment,1,1,0.9505466687301268
by a former marriage mr henry dashwood had one son by his present lady three daughters the son a steady respectable young man was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother which had been large and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age by his own marriage likewise which happened soon afterwards he added to his wealth to him therefore the succession to the norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters for their fortune independent of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that property could be but small their mother had nothing and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child and he had only a life-interest in it,1,1,0.9511404566553148
the old gentleman died his will was read and like almost every other will gave as much disappointment as pleasure he was neither so unjust nor so ungrateful as to leave his estate from his nephew -- but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest mr dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son -- but to his son and his son's son a child of four years old it was secured in such a way as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate or by any sale of its valuable woods the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child who in occasional visits with his father and mother at norland had so far gained on the affections of his uncle by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old an imperfect articulation an earnest desire of having his own way many cunning tricks and a great deal of noise as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which for years he had received from his niece and her daughters he meant not to be unkind however and as a mark of his affection for the three girls he left them a thousand pounds a-piece,1,1,0.9337159497117066
his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known and to him mr dashwood recommended with all the strength and urgency which illness could command the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters,1,1,0.9139193036532881
a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight was exactly what suited her mind in seasons of cheerfulness no temper could be more cheerful than hers or possess in a greater degree that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself but in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy,1,1,0.9513917018939556
mrs john dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters to take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree she begged him to think again on the subject how could he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child too of so large a sum and what possible claim could the miss dashwoods who were related to him only by half blood which she considered as no relationship at all have on his generosity to so large an amount it was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages and why was he to ruin himself and their poor little harry by giving away all his money to his half sisters,1,1,0.9814281533942087
he did not know what he was talking of i dare say ten to one but he was light-headed at the time had he been in his right senses he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child,1,1,0.6189683765133712
perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were diminished one half -- five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes,1,1,0.769413568965971
certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty an annuity is a very serious business it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it you are not aware of what you are doing i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father's will and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it twice every year these annuities were to be paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing my mother was quite sick of it her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been entirely at my mother's disposal without any restriction whatever it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world,1,1,0.847268147799013
it is certainly an unpleasant thing replied mr dashwood to have those kind of yearly drains on one's income one's fortune as your mother justly says is not one's own to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away one's independence,1,1,0.883454781435853
i believe you are right my love it will be better that there should by no annuity in the case whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year it will certainly be much the best way a present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed for money and will i think be amply discharging my promise to my father,1,1,0.8547259730068971
this argument was irresistible it gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before and he finally resolved that it would be absolutely unnecessary if not highly indecorous to do more for the widow and children of his father than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out,1,1,0.7825227727219182
mrs dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself and she thought of it for her daughters' sake with satisfaction though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000l would support her in affluence for their brother's sake too for the sake of his own heart she rejoiced and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before in believing him incapable of generosity his attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him and for a long time she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions,1,1,0.9913712506689587
the contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance felt for her daughter-in-law was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character which half a year's residence in her family afforded and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility according to the opinions of mrs dashwood to her daughters' continuance at norland,1,1,0.9954105265067391
edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of mrs dashwood's attention for she was at that time in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects she saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive and she liked him for it he did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation she was first called to observe and approve him farther by a reflection which elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister it was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother,1,1,0.992808991854782
do not be offended elinor if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits i have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind his inclinations and tastes as you have but i have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense i think him every thing that is worthy and amiable,1,1,0.8837791957238428
i shall very soon think him handsome elinor if i do not now when you tell me to love him as a brother i shall no more see imperfection in his face than i now do in his heart,1,1,0.7107229072511685
but whatever might really be its limits it was enough when perceived by his sister to make her uneasy and at the same time which was still more common to make her uncivil she took the first opportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion talking to her so expressively of her brother's great expectations of mrs ferrars's resolution that both her sons should marry well and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to draw him in that mrs dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious nor endeavor to be calm she gave her an answer which marked her contempt and instantly left the room resolving that whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal her beloved elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations,1,1,0.9933456490148621
no sooner was her answer dispatched than mrs dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it they heard her with surprise mrs john dashwood said nothing but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from norland she had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into devonshire -- edward turned hastily towards her on hearing this and in a voice of surprise and concern which required no explanation to her repeated devonshire are you indeed going there so far from hence and to what part of it she explained the situation it was within four miles northward of exeter,1,1,0.9925114790260071
the man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into devonshire to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival for as lady middleton was entirely unknown to mrs dashwood she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at barton park and she relied so undoubtingly on sir john's description of the house as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own her eagerness to be gone from norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment but mrs dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind and to be convinced from the general drift of his discourse that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at norland he so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping and of the perpetual demands upon his purse which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away,1,1,0.9969225629111902
many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved dear dear norland said marianne as she wandered alone before the house on the last evening of their being there when shall i cease to regret you -- when learn to feel a home elsewhere -- oh happy house could you know what i suffer in now viewing you from this spot from whence perhaps i may view you no more -- and you ye well-known trees -- but you will continue the same -- no leaf will decay because we are removed nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer -- no you will continue the same unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade -- but who will remain to enjoy you,1,1,0.7098085458263986
the first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant but as they drew towards the end of it their interest in the appearance of a country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection and a view of barton valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness it was a pleasant fertile spot well wooded and rich in pasture after winding along it for more than a mile they reached their own house a small green court was the whole of its demesne in front and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it,1,1,0.6625893588706979
in the mean time till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never saved in her life they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns and endeavoring by placing around them books and other possessions to form themselves a home marianne's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of and elinor's drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room,1,1,0.9230556548989708
mrs dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by sir john who welcomed them to barton park with unaffected sincerity and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them they would see he said only one gentleman there besides himself a particular friend who was staying at the park but who was neither very young nor very gay he hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party and could assure them it should never happen so again he had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements luckily lady middleton's mother had arrived at barton within the last hour and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine the young ladies as well as their mother were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party and wished for no more,1,1,0.9969240476520662
colonel brandon the friend of sir john seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend than lady middleton was to be his wife or mrs jennings to be lady middleton's mother he was silent and grave his appearance however was not unpleasing in spite of his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret an absolute old bachelor for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty but though his face was not handsome his countenance was sensible and his address was particularly gentlemanlike,1,1,0.9900223284312553
marianne's performance was highly applauded sir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every song and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted lady middleton frequently called him to order wondered how any one's attention could be diverted from music for a moment and asked marianne to sing a particular song which marianne had just finished colonel brandon alone of all the party heard her without being in raptures he paid her only the compliment of attention and she felt a respect for him on the occasion which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste his pleasure in music though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment she was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel's advanced state of life which humanity required,1,1,0.9851135608678718
infirmity said elinor do you call colonel brandon infirm i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs,1,1,0.8583515355220764
it would be impossible i know replied elinor to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough to love to make him a desirable companion to her but i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced to complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders,1,1,0.9125666913964886
had he been only in a violent fever you would not have despised him half so much confess marianne is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek hollow eye and quick pulse of a fever,1,1,0.6009735910800909
how strange this is what can be the meaning of it but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable how cold how composed were their last adieus how languid their conversation the last evening of their being together in edward's farewell there was no distinction between elinor and me it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both twice did i leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room and elinor in quitting norland and edward cried not as i did even now her self-command is invariable when is she dejected or melancholy when does she try to avoid society or appear restless and dissatisfied in it,1,1,0.9464791931448955
they gaily ascended the downs rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south-westerly wind they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and elinor from sharing such delightful sensations,1,1,0.621311247723375
margaret agreed and they pursued their way against the wind resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer when suddenly the clouds united over their heads and a driving rain set full in their face -- chagrined and surprised they were obliged though unwillingly to turn back for no shelter was nearer than their own house one consolation however remained for them to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate,1,1,0.5924220563106447
as good a kind of fellow as ever lived i assure you a very decent shot and there is not a bolder rider in england,1,0,0.3501161994518734
but marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of mr willoughby's pointer than he could describe to her the shades of his mind,1,1,0.9160273070557657
did he indeed cried marianne with sparkling eyes and with elegance with spirit,1,1,0.7293983328017056
sir john did not much understand this reproof but he laughed as heartily as if he did and then replied,1,1,0.7902378205531657
willoughby on his side gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance which an evident wish of improving it could offer he came to them every day to enquire after marianne was at first his excuse but the encouragement of his reception to which every day gave greater kindness made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible by marianne's perfect recovery she was confined for some days to the house but never had any confinement been less irksome willoughby was a young man of good abilities quick imagination lively spirits and open affectionate manners he was exactly formed to engage marianne's heart for with all this he joined not only a captivating person but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else,1,1,0.9980134028517418
do not boast of it however said elinor for it is injustice in both of you he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him,1,1,0.8835883964281807
in defence of your protege you can even be saucy,1,0,0.45374670090632624
he would have told me so i doubt not had i made any such inquiries but they happened to be points on which i had been previously informed,1,1,0.8867412505392194
you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass replied elinor and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man well-bred well-informed of gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart,1,1,0.8792817505628602
in colonel brandon alone of all her new acquaintance did elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities excite the interest of friendship or give pleasure as a companion willoughby was out of the question her admiration and regard even her sisterly regard was all his own but he was a lover his attentions were wholly marianne's and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing colonel brandon unfortunately for himself had no such encouragement to think only of marianne and in conversing with elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister,1,1,0.9988946274649271
elinor's compassion for him increased as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him this suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park when they were sitting down together by mutual consent while the others were dancing his eyes were fixed on marianne and after a silence of some minutes he said with a faint smile your sister i understand does not approve of second attachments,1,1,0.9593732413672937
i cannot agree with you there said elinor there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marianne's which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage,1,1,0.9534994486255425
does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment or is it equally criminal in every body are those who have been disappointed in their first choice whether from the inconstancy of its object or the perverseness of circumstances to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives,1,1,0.8899264912952112
he intends to send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it she added and when it arrives we will ride every day you shall share its use with me imagine to yourself my dear elinor the delight of a gallop on some of these downs,1,1,0.8239288647220265
marianne felt for her most sincerely but she did more harm than good to the cause by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to margaret,1,1,0.9174483935104462
no ma'am it came from town and is merely a letter of business,1,1,0.8564063125038411
i am particularly sorry ma'am said he addressing lady middleton that i should receive this letter today for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town,1,1,0.9673012491403119
but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr brandon said marianne eagerly will it not be sufficient,1,1,0.9318299382327666
elinor then heard willoughby say in a low voice to marianne there are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure brandon is one of them he was afraid of catching cold i dare say and invented this trick for getting out of it i would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing,1,1,0.9239190745146452
i hope we shall see you at barton added her ladyship as soon as you can conveniently leave town and we must put off the party to whitwell till you return,1,1,0.8791154631859585
you do not go to town on horseback do you added sir john,1,1,0.7847650638678318
is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter miss dashwood,1,1,0.8934845470070718
then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i should wish to do,1,0,0.4403137833514596
he wished her a good morning and attended by sir john left the room,1,1,0.9490957841171647
the complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained now burst forth universally and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed,1,1,0.7603616784924216
when sir john returned he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event concluding however by observing that as they were all got together they must do something by way of being happy and after some consultation it was agreed that although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country the carriages were then ordered willoughby's was first and marianne never looked happier than when she got into it he drove through the park very fast and they were soon out of sight and nothing more of them was seen till their return which did not happen till after the return of all the rest they both seemed delighted with their drive but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes while the others went on the downs,1,1,0.9652246590047212
it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening and that every body should be extremely merry all day long some more of the careys came to dinner and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table which sir john observed with great contentment willoughby took his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods mrs jennings sat on elinor's right hand and they had not been long seated before she leant behind her and willoughby and said to marianne loud enough for them both to hear i have found you out in spite of all your tricks i know where you spent the morning,1,1,0.9803500813750737
as soon as they left the dining-room elinor enquired of her about it and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by mrs jennings was perfectly true marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it,1,1,0.9893108016783825
mr willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to have any other companion i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life,1,1,0.8940043043194235
but my dear marianne as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct,1,1,0.8836161489716117
the sudden termination of colonel brandon's visit at the park with his steadiness in concealing its cause filled the mind and raised the wonder of mrs jennings for two or three days she was a great wonderer as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance she wondered with little intermission what could be the reason of it was sure there must be some bad news and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all,1,1,0.9733694355178035
do not be alarmed said miss dashwood nothing of the kind will be done for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it,1,1,0.8947782712425119
yes cried he in the same eager tone with all and every thing belonging to it -- in no one convenience or inconvenience about it should the least variation be perceptible then and then only under such a roof i might perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at barton,1,1,0.907412714706331
i flatter myself replied elinor that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this,1,1,0.7541885478534949
mrs dashwood's visit to lady middleton took place the next day and two of her daughters went with her but marianne excused herself from being of the party under some trifling pretext of employment and her mother who concluded that a promise had been made by willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home,1,1,0.9919873703944034
on their return from the park they found willoughby's curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage and mrs dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just so far it was all as she had foreseen but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect they were no sooner in the passage than marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction with her handkerchief at her eyes and without noticing them ran up stairs surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted where they found only willoughby who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back towards them he turned round on their coming in and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over-powered marianne,1,1,0.9834180224516487
he coloured as he replied you are very kind but i have no idea of returning into devonshire immediately my visits to mrs smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth,1,1,0.944437484338422
mrs dashwood felt too much for speech and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned,1,1,0.9411499176586319
elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's she thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust willoughby's behaviour in taking leave of them his embarrassment and affectation of cheerfulness and above all his unwillingness to accept her mother's invitation a backwardness so unlike a lover so unlike himself greatly disturbed her one moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister -- the distress in which marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for though when she considered what marianne's love for him was a quarrel seemed almost impossible,1,1,0.99436502393278
but whatever might be the particulars of their separation her sister's affliction was indubitable and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief but feeding and encouraging as a duty,1,1,0.9531519566080802
in about half an hour her mother returned and though her eyes were red her countenance was not uncheerful,1,1,0.7147961958627956
our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton elinor said she as she sat down to work and with how heavy a heart does he travel,1,1,0.8105314618071724
yes i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way -- but you elinor who love to doubt where you can -- it will not satisfy you i know but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it i am persuaded that mrs smith suspects his regard for marianne disapproves of it perhaps because she has other views for him and on that account is eager to get him away -- and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him this is what i believe to have happened he is moreover aware that she does disapprove the connection he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with marianne and he feels himself obliged from his dependent situation to give into her schemes and absent himself from devonshire for a while you will tell me i know that this may or may not have happened but i will listen to no cavil unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this and now elinor what have you to say,1,1,0.9756243998494718
i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly has not his behaviour to marianne and to all of us for at least the last fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation have we not perfectly understood each other has not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive and affectionate respect my elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement how could such a thought occur to you how is it to be supposed that willoughby persuaded as he must be of your sister's love should leave her and leave her perhaps for months without telling her of his affection -- that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence,1,1,0.9950144187963275
i confess replied elinor that every circumstance except one is in favour of their engagement but that one is the total silence of both on the subject and with me it almost outweighs every other,1,1,0.874285473846907
how strange this is you must think wretchedly indeed of willoughby if after all that has openly passed between them you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time do you suppose him really indifferent to her,1,1,0.9110345376570841
no i cannot think that he must and does love her i am sure,1,1,0.7540373989402149
remember elinor said she how very often sir john fetches our letters himself from the post and carries them to it we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through sir john's hands,1,1,0.9234471393778179
elinor could not deny the truth of this and she tried to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence but there was one method so direct so simple and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state of the affair and of instantly removing all mystery that she could not help suggesting it to her mother,1,1,0.8401573345531252
months cried marianne with strong surprise no -- nor many weeks,1,1,0.8819672488514729
after a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries of meeting marianne asked edward if he came directly from london no he had been in devonshire a fortnight,1,1,0.9510567430862787
he looked rather distressed as he added that he had been staying with some friends near plymouth,1,1,0.8060449385837273
how can you think of dirt with such objects before you,1,0,0.4126691169197025
have you an agreeable neighbourhood here are the middletons pleasant people,1,1,0.8723259941710337
but how is your fame to be established for famous you must be to satisfy all your family and with no inclination for expense no affection for strangers no profession and no assurance you may find it a difficult matter,1,1,0.8396140360884328
i shall not attempt it i have no wish to be distinguished and have every reason to hope i never shall thank heaven i cannot be forced into genius and eloquence,1,1,0.749051897527351
strange that it would cried marianne what have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness,1,1,0.7838065208929913
elinor for shame said marianne money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it beyond a competence it can afford no real satisfaction as far as mere self is concerned,1,1,0.9186623775587007
i wish said margaret striking out a novel thought that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece,1,1,0.6402019539023617
we are all unanimous in that wish i suppose said elinor in spite of the insufficiency of wealth,1,1,0.8032647023860662
you must begin your improvements on this house observed elinor and your difficulties will soon vanish,1,1,0.8584770885430336
what magnificent orders would travel from this family to london said edward in such an event what a happy day for booksellers music-sellers and print-shops you miss dashwood would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you -- and as for marianne i know her greatness of soul there would not be music enough in london to content her and books -- thomson cowper scott -- she would buy them all over and over again she would buy up every copy i believe to prevent their falling into unworthy hands and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree should not you marianne forgive me if i am very saucy but i was willing to shew you that i had not forgot our old disputes,1,1,0.8582649336899424
and the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs,1,0,0.33558562978726353
perhaps then you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life -- your opinion on that point is unchanged i presume,1,1,0.6665372148811436
why should you think so replied he with a sigh but gaiety never was a part of my character,1,1,0.6385784366554013
nor do i think it a part of marianne's said elinor i should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry,1,1,0.9704521482930037
i have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes said elinor in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other fancying people so much more gay or grave or ingenious or stupid than they really are and i can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves and very frequently by what other people say of them without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge,1,1,0.7314382865151138
no marianne never my doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding all i have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour you must not confound my meaning i am guilty i confess of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention but when have i advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters,1,1,0.9809844281515087
my judgment he returned is all on your side of the question but i am afraid my practice is much more on your sister's i never wish to offend but i am so foolishly shy that i often seem negligent when i am only kept back by my natural awkwardness i have frequently thought that i must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company i am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility,1,1,0.896488213717086
but you would still be reserved said marianne and that is worse,1,1,0.8912921209556932
edward made no answer his gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him in their fullest extent -- and he sat for some time silent and dull,1,1,0.6618359449196227
i suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own,1,1,0.7941185396759958
it is very true said marianne that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was i detest jargon of every kind and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself because i could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning,1,1,0.7217326931818874
elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne the only difference in their conclusions was that what marianne considered as a free gift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself she was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront and affecting to take no notice of what passed by instantly talking of something else she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself beyond all doubt that it was exactly the shade of her own,1,1,0.9642644513462132
a dance cried marianne impossible who is to dance,1,1,0.7611147494640381
i wish with all my soul cried sir john that willoughby were among us again,1,1,0.7907546357040323
she gave him a brief reply marianne's countenance was more communicative edward saw enough to comprehend not only the meaning of others but such of marianne's expressions as had puzzled him before and when their visitors left them he went immediately round her and said in a whisper i have been guessing shall i tell you my guess,1,1,0.9549360178497036
they will be brought up said he in a serious accent to be as unlike myself as is possible in feeling in action in condition in every thing,1,1,0.5599150530694827
elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the house busily employed herself the whole day neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family and if by this conduct she did not lessen her own grief it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account,1,1,0.990439971256716
well said he we have brought you some strangers how do you like them,1,0,0.370399996890214
never mind if they do it is only the palmers charlotte is very pretty i can tell you you may see her if you look this way,1,1,0.7472302898935083
well what a delightful room this is i never saw anything so charming only think mamma how it is improved since i was here last i always thought it such a sweet place ma'am turning to mrs dashwood but you have made it so charming only look sister how delightful every thing is how i should like such a house for myself should not you mr palmer,1,1,0.980506327456687
mr palmer does not hear me said she laughing he never does sometimes it is so ridiculous,1,1,0.8008103305269252
as the miss dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next day at one door mrs palmer came running in at the other looking as good humoured and merry as before she took them all most affectionately by the hand and expressed great delight in seeing them again,1,1,0.9067616827183967
not go to town cried mrs palmer with a laugh i shall be quite disappointed if you do not i could get the nicest house in world for you next door to ours in hanover-square you must come indeed i am sure i shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till i am confined if mrs dashwood should not like to go into public,1,1,0.9101641538127692
her love made no answer and after slightly bowing to the ladies began complaining of the weather,1,1,0.5666787235372897
as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life said mr palmer,1,1,0.5780147459333457
marianne remained perfectly silent though her countenance betrayed her interest in what was said,1,1,0.9239195937999137
when they were seated in the dining room sir john observed with regret that they were only eight all together,1,1,0.8627585355236871
elinor was not inclined after a little observation to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear his temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding like many others of his sex that through some unaccountable bias in favour of beauty he was the husband of a very silly woman -- but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it -- it was rather a wish of distinction she believed which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body and his general abuse of every thing before him it was the desire of appearing superior to other people the motive was too common to be wondered at but the means however they might succeed by establishing his superiority in ill-breeding were not likely to attach any one to him except his wife,1,1,0.9802637900171157
certainly he replied with a sneer -- i came into devonshire with no other view,1,0,0.4507660747882493
but indeed you must and shall come i am sure you will like it of all things the westons will be with us and it will be quite delightful you cannot think what a sweet place cleveland is and we are so gay now for mr palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election and so many people came to dine with us that i never saw before it is quite charming but poor fellow it is very fatiguing to him for he is forced to make every body like him,1,1,0.8302430896451087
he cannot bear writing you know she continued -- he says it is quite shocking,1,1,0.6630970974072753
oh dear yes i know him extremely well replied mrs palmer -- not that i ever spoke to him indeed but i have seen him for ever in town somehow or other i never happened to be staying at barton while he was at allenham mama saw him here once before -- but i was with my uncle at weymouth however i dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in somersetshire if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together he is very little at combe i believe but if he were ever so much there i do not think mr palmer would visit him for he is in the opposition you know and besides it is such a way off i know why you inquire about him very well your sister is to marry him i am monstrous glad of it for then i shall have her for a neighbour you know,1,1,0.9882269837916078
upon my word replied elinor you know much more of the matter than i do if you have any reason to expect such a match,1,1,0.8903168698923781
oh -- he did not say much but he looked as if he knew it to be true so from that moment i set it down as certain it will be quite delightful i declare when is it to take place,1,1,0.7004326173050289
mrs palmer's information respecting willoughby was not very material but any testimony in his favour however small was pleasing to her,1,1,0.9787062405616918
i am so glad we are got acquainted at last continued charlotte -- and now i hope we shall always be great friends you can't think how much i longed to see you it is so delightful that you should live at the cottage nothing can be like it to be sure and i am so glad your sister is going to be well married i hope you will be a great deal at combe magna it is a sweet place by all accounts,1,1,0.9441250774289612
the palmers returned to cleveland the next day and the two families at barton were again left to entertain each other but this did not last long elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head had hardly done wondering at charlotte's being so happy without a cause at mr palmer's acting so simply with good abilities and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife before sir john's and mrs jennings's active zeal in the cause of society procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe,1,1,0.9833047556265931
in a morning's excursion to exeter they had met with two young ladies whom mrs jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations and this was enough for sir john to invite them directly to the park as soon as their present engagements at exeter were over their engagements at exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation and lady middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the return of sir john by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life and of whose elegance -- whose tolerable gentility even she could have no proof for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all their being her relations too made it so much the worse and mrs jennings's attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable because they were all cousins and must put up with one another as it was impossible however now to prevent their coming lady middleton resigned herself to the idea of it with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times every day,1,1,0.9985957611345869
the young ladies arrived their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable their dress was very smart their manners very civil they were delighted with the house and in raptures with the furniture and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that lady middleton's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had been an hour at the park she declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration sir john's confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the miss dashwoods of the miss steeles' arrival and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world from such commendation as this however there was not much to be learned elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of england under every possible variation of form face temper and understanding sir john wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly and look at his guests benevolent philanthropic man it was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself,1,1,0.9964945934657585
poor little creatures said miss steele as soon as they were gone it might have been a very sad accident,1,1,0.8666603284333871
and what a charming little family they have i never saw such fine children in my life -- i declare i quite doat upon them already and indeed i am always distractedly fond of children,1,1,0.8671640099882817
i have a notion said lucy you think the little middletons rather too much indulged perhaps they may be the outside of enough but it is so natural in lady middleton and for my part i love to see children full of life and spirits i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet,1,1,0.8380345269150069
upon my word replied elinor i cannot tell you for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word but this i can say that if he ever was a beau before he married he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him,1,1,0.8955286171540184
you will think my question an odd one i dare say said lucy to her one day as they were walking together from the park to the cottage -- but pray are you personally acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother mrs ferrars,1,1,0.9638360212233552
you may well be surprised continued lucy for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before for i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family because it was always meant to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour not a soul of all my relations know of it but anne and i never should have mentioned it to you if i had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy and i really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about mrs ferrars must seem so odd that it ought to be explained and i do not think mr ferrars can be displeased when he knows i have trusted you because i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite as his own sisters -- she paused,1,1,0.9835961150234435
our acquaintance however is of many years date he was under my uncle's care you know a considerable while,1,1,0.8026253009619415
yes and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait poor edward it puts him quite out of heart then taking a small miniature from her pocket she added to prevent the possibility of mistake be so good as to look at this face it does not do him justice to be sure but yet i think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was drew for -- i have had it above these three years,1,1,0.7657439667838029
i have never been able continued lucy to give him my picture in return which i am very much vexed at for he has been always so anxious to get it but i am determined to set for it the very first opportunity,1,1,0.9718070836445796
i am sure said she i have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret because you must know of what importance it is to us not to have it reach his mother for she would never approve of it i dare say i shall have no fortune and i fancy she is an exceeding proud woman,1,1,0.7341240312257599
i certainly did not seek your confidence said elinor but you do me no more than justice in imagining that i may be depended on your secret is safe with me but pardon me if i express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication you must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety,1,1,0.9121636211788927
oh yes he had been staying a fortnight with us did you think he came directly from town,1,1,0.8723347976698611
no replied elinor most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of lucy's veracity i remember he told us that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near plymouth she remembered too her own surprise at the time at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends at his total silence with respect even to their names,1,1,0.9597943428653435
elinor saw that it was his hand and she could doubt no longer this picture she had allowed herself to believe might have been accidentally obtained it might not have been edward's gift but a correspondence between them by letter could subsist only under a positive engagement could be authorised by nothing else for a few moments she was almost overcome -- her heart sunk within her and she could hardly stand but exertion was indispensably necessary and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings that her success was speedy and for the time complete,1,1,0.9895716401225451
writing to each other said lucy returning the letter into her pocket is the only comfort we have in such long separations yes i have one other comfort in his picture but poor edward has not even that if he had but my picture he says he should be easy i gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at longstaple last and that was some comfort to him he said but not equal to a picture perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him,1,1,0.8435350993843644
fortunately for her they had now reached the cottage and the conversation could be continued no farther after sitting with them a few minutes the miss steeles returned to the park and elinor was then at liberty to think and be wretched,1,1,0.9667920786394459
if in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself his difficulties from his mother had seemed great how much greater were they now likely to be when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections and probably inferior in fortune to herself these difficulties indeed with a heart so alienated from lucy might not press very hard upon his patience but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness could be felt as a relief,1,1,0.9773647188487824
as these considerations occurred to her in painful succession she wept for him more than for herself supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness and consoled by the belief that edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem she thought she could even now under the first smart of the heavy blow command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters and so well was she able to answer her own expectations that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters that elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love and that marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house,1,1,0.9881686116076939
the necessity of concealing from her mother and marianne what had been entrusted in confidence to herself though it obliged her to unceasing exertion was no aggravation of elinor's distress on the contrary it was a relief to her to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of edward which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself and which was more than she felt equal to support,1,1,0.9952629323330767
from their counsel or their conversation she knew she could receive no assistance their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise she was stronger alone and her own good sense so well supported her that her firmness was as unshaken her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable as with regrets so poignant and so fresh it was possible for them to be,1,1,0.9596530787768872
the young ladies went and lady middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her the insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as elinor had expected it produced not one novelty of thought or expression and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room to the latter the children accompanied them and while they remained there she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging lucy's attention to attempt it they quitted it only with the removal of the tea-things the card-table was then placed and elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park they all rose up in preparation for a round game,1,1,0.9889561170933172
this hint was enough lucy recollected herself instantly and replied indeed you are very much mistaken lady middleton i am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me or i should have been at my filigree already i would not disappoint the little angel for all the world and if you want me at the card-table now i am resolved to finish the basket after supper,1,1,0.9434837738302079
lady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that she had never made so rude a speech,1,1,0.7438614236568744
marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know ma'am said elinor endeavouring to smooth away the offence and i do not much wonder at it for it is the very best toned piano-forte i ever heard,1,1,0.9076183113670224
indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help cried lucy for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all,1,1,0.9178597065998794
elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals and thus by a little of that address which marianne could never condescend to practise gained her own end and pleased lady middleton at the same time lucy made room for her with ready attention and the two fair rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table and with the utmost harmony engaged in forwarding the same work the pianoforte at which marianne wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts had by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself was luckily so near them that miss dashwood now judged she might safely under the shelter of its noise introduce the interesting subject without any risk of being heard at the card-table,1,1,0.9827764692004941
offended me how could you suppose so believe me and elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea could you have a motive for the trust that was not honourable and flattering to me,1,1,0.8352589578912778
and yet i do assure you replied lucy her little sharp eyes full of meaning there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable i felt sure that you was angry with me and have been quarrelling with myself ever since for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs but i am very glad to find it was only my own fancy and that you really do not blame me if you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what i am always thinking of every moment of my life your compassion would make you overlook every thing else i am sure,1,1,0.9182960244545049
he has only two thousand pounds of his own it would be madness to marry upon that though for my own part i could give up every prospect of more without a sigh i have been always used to a very small income and could struggle with any poverty for him but i love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him perhaps of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her we must wait it may be for many years with almost every other man in the world it would be an alarming prospect but edward's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of i know,1,1,0.9613357838339139
no sister cried lucy you are mistaken there our favourite beaux are not great coxcombs,1,1,0.9311235659322225
i will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head for bringing matters to bear indeed i am bound to let you into the secret for you are a party concerned i dare say you have seen enough of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of some regard to me your brother might be persuaded to give him norland living which i understand is a very good one and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while that would be enough for us to marry upon and we might trust to time and chance for the rest,1,1,0.9209543895867538
indeed you wrong me replied lucy with great solemnity i know nobody of whose judgment i think so highly as i do of yours and i do really believe that if you was to say to me 'i advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with edward ferrars it will be more for the happiness of both of you ' i should resolve upon doing it immediately,1,1,0.9608133072074667
how unlucky that is i had quite depended upon meeting you there anne and me are to go the latter end of january to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years but i only go for the sake of seeing edward he will be there in february otherwise london would have no charms for me i have not spirits for it,1,1,0.9677714853619692
elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the first rubber and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end to which both of them submitted without any reluctance for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before and elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage which sincere affection on her side would have given for self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary,1,1,0.9838272353940728
oh lord i am sure your mother can spare you very well and i do beg you will favour me with your company for i've quite set my heart upon it don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me for i shan't put myself at all out of my way for you it will only be sending betty by the coach and i hope i can afford that we three shall be able to go very well in my chaise and when we are in town if you do not like to go wherever i do well and good you may always go with one of my daughters i am sure your mother will not object to it for i have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you and if i don't get one of you at least well married before i have done with you it shall not be my fault i shall speak a good word for you to all the young men you may depend upon it,1,1,0.7199065221382743
nay cried mrs jennings i am sure i shall be monstrous glad of miss marianne's company whether miss dashwood will go or not only the more the merrier say i and i thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together because if they got tired of me they might talk to one another and laugh at my old ways behind my back but one or the other if not both of them i must have lord bless me how do you think i can live poking by myself i who have been always used till this winter to have charlotte with me come miss marianne let us strike hands upon the bargain and if miss dashwood will change her mind by and bye why so much the better,1,1,0.9591390639794303
mrs jennings repeated her assurance that mrs dashwood could spare them perfectly well and elinor who now understood her sister and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with willoughby again made no farther direct opposition to the plan and merely referred it to her mother's decision from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit which she could not approve of for marianne and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid whatever marianne was desirous of her mother would be eager to promote -- she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to london that marianne fastidious as she was thoroughly acquainted with mrs jennings' manners and invariably disgusted by them should overlook every inconvenience of that kind should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings in her pursuit of one object was such a proof so strong so full of the importance of that object to her as elinor in spite of all that had passed was not prepared to witness,1,1,0.9996506165013948
on being informed of the invitation mrs dashwood persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself how much the heart of marianne was in it would not hear of their declining the offer upon her account insisted on their both accepting it directly and then began to foresee with her usual cheerfulness a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all from this separation,1,1,0.9904026463336705
that is very true replied her mother but of her society separately from that of other people you will scarcely have any thing at all and you will almost always appear in public with lady middleton,1,1,0.860083623841667
elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother's dependence on the attachment of edward and herself that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed and now on this attack though almost hopeless of success she forced herself to begin her design by saying as calmly as she could i like edward ferrars very much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am ever known to them or not,1,1,0.9867410340540099
marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive her mother's affliction was hardly less and elinor was the only one of the three who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal,1,1,0.9712157065226222
her spirits still continued very high but there was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister and this agitation increased as the evening drew on she could scarcely eat any dinner and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage,1,1,0.9755396616714892
it was a great satisfaction to elinor that mrs jennings by being much engaged in her own room could see little of what was passing the tea things were brought in and already had marianne been disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door when a loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house elinor felt secure of its announcing willoughby's approach and marianne starting up moved towards the door every thing was silent this could not be borne many seconds she opened the door advanced a few steps towards the stairs and after listening half a minute returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming oh elinor it is willoughby indeed it is and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms when colonel brandon appeared,1,1,0.9885964119091305
it was too great a shock to be borne with calmness and she immediately left the room elinor was disappointed too but at the same time her regard for colonel brandon ensured his welcome with her and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him that he even observed marianne as she quitted the room with such astonishment and concern as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself,1,1,0.9924917978645398
after an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat or in other words in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on mrs jennings's side and in laughter without cause on mrs palmer's it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning to which mrs jennings and elinor readily consented as having likewise some purchases to make themselves and marianne though declining it at first was induced to go likewise,1,1,0.9941168742306332
that is true cried marianne in a cheerful voice and walking to the window as she spoke to examine the day i had not thought of that this weather will keep many sportsmen in the country,1,1,0.7131069165775273
at any rate said elinor wishing to prevent mrs jennings from seeing her sister's thoughts as clearly as she did i dare say we shall have sir john and lady middleton in town by the end of next week,1,1,0.9937734664349881
the morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of mrs jennings's acquaintance to inform them of her being in town and marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air,1,1,0.8998347175593964
you are expecting a letter then said elinor unable to be longer silent,1,1,0.923998253653519
after a short pause you have no confidence in me marianne,1,1,0.8446407518231739
me returned elinor in some confusion indeed marianne i have nothing to tell,1,1,0.9562926170262019
he looked surprised and said i beg your pardon i am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent but i had not supposed any secrecy intended as they openly correspond and their marriage is universally talked of,1,1,0.8835316008301569
by many -- by some of whom you know nothing by others with whom you are most intimate mrs jennings mrs palmer and the middletons but still i might not have believed it for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced it will always find something to support its doubts if i had not when the servant let me in today accidentally seen a letter in his hand directed to mr willoughby in your sister's writing i came to inquire but i was convinced before i could ask the question is every thing finally settled is it impossible to- but i have no right and i could have no chance of succeeding excuse me miss dashwood i believe i have been wrong in saying so much but i hardly know what to do and on your prudence i have the strongest dependence tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on that any attempt that in short concealment if concealment be possible is all that remains,1,1,0.9951242178701895
these words which conveyed to elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister affected her very much she was not immediately able to say anything and even when her spirits were recovered she debated for a short time on the answer it would be most proper to give the real state of things between willoughby and her sister was so little known to herself that in endeavouring to explain it she might be as liable to say too much as too little yet as she was convinced that marianne's affection for willoughby could leave no hope of colonel brandon's success whatever the event of that affection might be and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure she thought it most prudent and kind after some consideration to say more than she really knew or believed she acknowledged therefore that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other of their mutual affection she had no doubt and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear,1,1,0.9982466327895448
go to him elinor she cried as soon as she could speak and force him to come to me tell him i must see him again -- must speak to him instantly -- i cannot rest -- i shall not have a moment's peace till this is explained -- some dreadful misapprehension or other -- oh go to him this moment,1,1,0.6818497021186771
no elinor she replied ask nothing you will soon know all,1,1,0.9011107880277418
bond street january my dear madam,1,1,0.675017254882034
i have just had the honour of receiving your letter for which i beg to return my sincere acknowledgments i am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation and though i am quite at a loss to discover in what point i could be so unfortunate as to offend you i entreat your forgiveness of what i can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional i shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in devonshire without the most grateful pleasure and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions my esteem for your whole family is very sincere but if i have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than i felt or meant to express i shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem that i should ever have meant more you will allow to be impossible when you understand that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere and it will not be many weeks i believe before this engagement is fulfilled it is with great regret that i obey your commands in returning the letters with which i have been honoured from you and the lock of hair which you so obligingly bestowed on me,1,1,0.9817178500327292
with what indignation such a letter as this must be read by miss dashwood may be imagined though aware before she began it that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy and confirm their separation for ever she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it nor could she have supposed willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman as to send a letter so impudently cruel a letter which instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret acknowledged no breach of faith denied all peculiar affection whatever -- a letter of which every line was an insult and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy,1,1,0.9734949437000341
in her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it and probably on the very different mind of a very different person who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early she was all astonishment to perceive mrs jennings's chariot which she knew had not been ordered till one determined not to quit marianne though hopeless of contributing at present to her ease she hurried away to excuse herself from attending mrs jennings on account of her sister being indisposed mrs jennings with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for its cause admitted the excuse most readily and elinor after seeing her safe off returned to marianne whom she found attempting to rise from the bed and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food for it was many days since she had any appetite and many nights since she had really slept and now when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head a weakened stomach and a general nervous faintness a glass of wine which elinor procured for her directly made her more comfortable and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness by saying,1,1,0.9967110425861995
i can have no pleasure while i see you in this state,1,1,0.6014422127058903
engagement cried marianne there has been no engagement,1,1,0.957975442672217
what am i to imagine willoughby by your behaviour last night again i demand an explanation of it i was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced with the familiarity which our intimacy at barton appeared to me to justify i was repulsed indeed i have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting but though i have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour i am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it you have perhaps been misinformed or purposely deceived in something concerning me which may have lowered me in your opinion tell me what it is explain the grounds on which you acted and i shall be satisfied in being able to satisfy you it would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you but if i am to do it if i am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you that your regard for us all was insincere that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive let it be told as soon as possible my feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision i wish to acquit you but certainty on either side will be ease to what i now suffer if your sentiments are no longer what they were you will return my notes and the lock of my hair which is in your possession,1,1,0.9799758412170847
i felt myself she added to be as solemnly engaged to him as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other,1,0,0.4145296690438404
elinor advised her to lie down again and for a moment she did so but no attitude could give her ease and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another till growing more and more hysterical her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance some lavender drops however which she was at length persuaded to take were of use and from that time till mrs jennings returned she continued on the bed quiet and motionless,1,1,0.9128477883839404
marianne to the surprise of her sister determined on dining with them elinor even advised her against it but no she would go down she could bear it very well and the bustle about her would be less elinor pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner said no more and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could while marianne still remained on the bed was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it,1,1,0.9920613256100479
poor soul cried mrs jennings as soon as she was gone how it grieves me to see her and i declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine and the dried cherries too lord nothing seems to do her any good i am sure if i knew of any thing she would like i would send all over the town for it well it is the oddest thing to me that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill but when there is plenty of money on one side and next to none on the other lord bless you they care no more about such things --,1,1,0.8242619475485065
law my dear don't pretend to defend him no positive engagement indeed after taking her all over allenham house and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter,1,1,0.8448315727547048
dear ma'am replied elinor smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended how good you are but i have just left marianne in bed and i hope almost asleep and as i think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest if you will give me leave i will drink the wine myself,1,1,0.9018308975644996
it is but have you likewise heard that miss grey has fifty thousand pounds in that if in any thing we may find an explanation,1,1,0.704795312047399
ah said colonel brandon there is indeed but your sister does not -- i think you said so -- she does not consider quite as you do,1,1,0.8806156297636931
you know her disposition and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could,1,1,0.8376461378163669
no no no it cannot be she cried she cannot feel her kindness is not sympathy her good-nature is not tenderness all that she wants is gossip and she only likes me now because i supply it,1,1,0.8483970184541969
elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others by the irritable refinement of her own mind and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a strong sensibility and the graces of a polished manner like half the rest of the world if more than half there be that are clever and good marianne with excellent abilities and an excellent disposition was neither reasonable nor candid she expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself thus a circumstance occurred while the sisters were together in their own room after breakfast which sunk the heart of mrs jennings still lower in her estimation because through her own weakness it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself though mrs jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill,1,1,0.9934283100316255
with a letter in her outstretched hand and countenance gaily smiling from the persuasion of bringing comfort she entered their room saying,1,1,0.891393614503677
i will not trust to that retreating to her own room a man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others,1,1,0.5898198222515503
you have probably entirely forgotten a conversation -- it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you -- a conversation between us one evening at barton park -- it was the evening of a dance -- in which i alluded to a lady i had once known as resembling in some measure your sister marianne,1,1,0.9525018829805322
if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender recollection there is a very strong resemblance between them as well in mind as person the same warmth of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits this lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends i cannot remember the time when i did not love eliza and my affection for her as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me incapable of having ever felt her's for me was i believe fervent as the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby and it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate at seventeen she was lost to me for ever she was married -- married against her inclination to my brother her fortune was large and our family estate much encumbered and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty and for some time it did but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though she had promised me that nothing -- but how blindly i relate i have never told you how this was brought on we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland the treachery or the folly of my cousin's maid betrayed us i was banished to the house of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father's point was gained i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one -- but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have now to lament it this however was not the case my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been and from the first he treated her unkindly the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as mrs brandon's was but too natural she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my father lived only a few months after their marriage and i was with my regiment in the east indies she should fall had i remained in england perhaps -- but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange the shock which her marriage had given me he continued in a voice of great agitation was of trifling weight -- was nothing to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce it was that which threw this gloom -- even now the recollection of what i suffered --,1,1,0.9969615199652654
the first news that reached me of her he continued came in a letter from herself last october it was forwarded to me from delaford and i received it on the very morning of our intended party to whitwell and this was the reason of my leaving barton so suddenly which i am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body and which i believe gave offence to some little did mr willoughby imagine i suppose when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party that i was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable but had he known it what would it have availed would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister no he had already done that which no man who can feel for another would do he had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced in a situation of the utmost distress with no creditable home no help no friends ignorant of his address he had left her promising to return he neither returned nor wrote nor relieved her,1,1,0.9810700097239368
sir john could not have thought it possible a man of whom he had always had such reason to think well such a good-natured fellow he did not believe there was a bolder rider in england it was an unaccountable business he wished him at the devil with all his heart he would not speak another word to him meet him where he might for all the world no not if it were to be by the side of barton covert and they were kept watching for two hours together such a scoundrel of a fellow such a deceitful dog it was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of folly's puppies and this was the end of it,1,1,0.819734187835631
mrs palmer in her way was equally angry she was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all she wished with all her heart combe magna was not so near cleveland but it did not signify for it was a great deal too far off to visit she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again and she should tell everybody she saw how good-for-nothing he was,1,1,0.9926679783254709
every qualification is raised at times by the circumstances of the moment to more than its real value and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good-nature,1,1,0.6929510516965048
colonel brandon's delicate unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to miss dashwood he had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her sister's disappointment by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it and they always conversed with confidence his chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations was given in the pitying eye with which marianne sometimes observed him and the gentleness of her voice whenever though it did not often happen she was obliged or could oblige herself to speak to him these assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself and these gave elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter but mrs jennings who knew nothing of all this who knew only that the colonel continued as grave as ever and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself nor commission her to make it for him began at the end of two days to think that instead of midsummer they would not be married till michaelmas and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all the good understanding between the colonel and miss dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry-tree the canal and the yew arbour would all be made over to her and mrs jennings had for some time ceased to think at all of mrs ferrars,1,1,0.9983601312239565
aye aye that is very pretty talking -- but it won't do -- the doctor is the man i see,1,0,0.3960083630116994
i suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister miss dashwood when they come to town said lucy returning after a cessation of hostile hints to the charge,1,1,0.9211387251645776
long a time indeed interposed mrs jennings why their visit is but just begun,1,1,0.8746277181937628
after some opposition marianne yielded to her sister's entreaties and consented to go out with her and mrs jennings one morning for half an hour she expressly conditioned however for paying no visits and would do no more than accompany them to gray's in sackville street where elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother,1,1,0.9705296055339017
excellent indeed their attention to our comfort their friendliness in every particular is more than i can express,1,1,0.8247887874067169
i am extremely glad to hear it upon my word extremely glad indeed but so it ought to be they are people of large fortune they are related to you and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected and so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing edward brought us a most charming account of the place the most complete thing of its kind he said that ever was and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing it was a great satisfaction to us to hear it i assure you,1,1,0.9720975275110337
two thousand a-year and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity he added elinor i wish with all my heart it were twice as much for your sake,1,1,0.6664225372454939
is mr edward ferrars said elinor with resolution going to be married,1,1,0.9938487742718611
why i hope not that i might have sold it again the next day for more than i gave but with regard to the purchase-money i might have been very unfortunate indeed for the stocks were at that time so low that if i had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker's hands i must have sold out to very great loss,1,1,0.749862937530663
another year or two may do much towards it he gravely replied but however there is still a great deal to be done there is not a stone laid of fanny's green-house and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden marked out,1,0,0.459448360502396
but she raises none in those most concerned indeed brother your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far,1,1,0.7482188903275298
why to be sure said he seeming to recollect himself people have little have very little in their power but my dear elinor what is the matter with marianne -- she looks very unwell has lost her colour and is grown quite thin is she ill,1,1,0.9356898212917559
i am sorry for that at her time of life any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever her's has been a very short one she was as handsome a girl last september as i ever saw and as likely to attract the man there was something in her style of beauty to please them particularly i remember fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did not but what she is exceedingly fond of you but so it happened to strike her she will be mistaken however i question whether marianne now will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a-year at the utmost and i am very much deceived if you do not do better dorsetshire i know very little of dorsetshire but my dear elinor i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it and i think i can answer for your having fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors,1,1,0.991085521666762
mrs john dashwood had so much confidence in her husband's judgment that she waited the very next day both on mrs jennings and her daughter and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former even the woman with whom her sisters were staying by no means unworthy her notice and as for lady middleton she found her one of the most charming women in the world,1,1,0.9959031825421991
the important tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law,1,1,0.5770027859728583
pity me dear miss dashwood said lucy as they walked up the stairs together -- for the middletons arrived so directly after mrs jennings that they all followed the servant at the same time -- there is nobody here but you that can feel for me -- i declare i can hardly stand good gracious -- in a moment i shall see the person that all my happiness depends on -- that is to be my mother --,1,1,0.9743813440751153
elinor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour -- a few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly but it was not in mrs ferrars' power to distress her by it now -- and the difference of her manners to the miss steeles a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more only amused her she could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person -- for lucy was particularly distinguished -- whom of all others had they known as much as she did they would have been most anxious to mortify while she herself who had comparatively no power to wound them sat pointedly slighted by both but while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which it sprung nor observe the studied attentions with which the miss steeles courted its continuance without thoroughly despising them all four,1,1,0.9969131577417673
the colonel though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship warmly admired the screens as he would have done any thing painted by miss dashwood and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited they were handed round for general inspection mrs ferrars not aware of their being elinor's work particularly requested to look at them and after they had received gratifying testimony of lady middletons's approbation fanny presented them to her mother considerately informing her at the same time that they were done by miss dashwood,1,1,0.9934936767236338
i guessed you would say so -- replied lucy quickly -- but there was no reason in the world why mrs ferrars should seem to like me if she did not and her liking me is every thing you shan't talk me out of my satisfaction i am sure it will all end well and there will be no difficulties at all to what i used to think mrs ferrars is a charming woman and so is your sister they are both delightful women indeed -- i wonder i should never hear you say how agreeable mrs dashwood was,1,1,0.9881841584327633
elinor tried to make a civil answer though doubting her own success but it seemed to satisfy lucy for she directly replied,1,1,0.9605733724111224
her manners gave some re-assurance to edward and he had courage enough to sit down but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion which the case rendered reasonable though his sex might make it rare for his heart had not the indifference of lucy's nor could his conscience have quite the ease of elinor's,1,1,0.9256242409814456
edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt again they all sat down and for a moment or two all were silent while marianne was looking with the most speaking tenderness sometimes at edward and sometimes at elinor regretting only that their delight in each other should be checked by lucy's unwelcome presence edward was the first to speak and it was to notice marianne's altered looks and express his fear of her not finding london agree with her,1,1,0.9903722110655925
but why were you not there edward -- why did you not come,1,1,0.5432779983208451
and drawing him a little aside she whispered her persuasion that lucy could not stay much longer but even this encouragement failed for he would go and lucy who would have outstaid him had his visit lasted two hours soon afterwards went away,1,1,0.9704149608249927
what can bring her here so often said marianne on her leaving them could not she see that we wanted her gone -- how teazing to edward,1,1,0.9255449610099873
marianne looked at her steadily and said you know elinor that this is a kind of talking which i cannot bear if you only hope to have your assertion contradicted as i must suppose to be the case you ought to recollect that i am the last person in the world to do it i cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances that are not really wanted,1,1,0.9176735172245495
within a few days after this meeting the newspapers announced to the world that the lady of thomas palmer esq was safely delivered of a son and heir a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph at least to all those intimate connections who knew it before,1,1,0.8857320567410839
they had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former and by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye as intruding on their ground and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize though nothing could be more polite than lady middleton's behaviour to elinor and marianne she did not really like them at all because they neither flattered herself nor her children she could not believe them good-natured and because they were fond of reading she fancied them satirical perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical but that did not signify it was censure in common use and easily given,1,1,0.9811388018754659
i come now to the relation of a misfortune which about this time befell mrs john dashwood it so happened that while her two sisters with mrs jennings were first calling on her in harley street another of her acquaintance had dropt in -- a circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her but while the imaginations of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct and to decide on it by slight appearances one's happiness must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance in the present instance this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability that on merely hearing the name of the miss dashwoods and understanding them to be mr dashwood's sisters she immediately concluded them to be staying in harley street and this misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards cards of invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister to a small musical party at her house the consequence of which was that mrs john dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the miss dashwoods but what was still worse must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing to treat them with attention and who could tell that they might not expect to go out with her a second time the power of disappointing them it was true must always be her's but that was not enough for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from them,1,1,0.9984144331338037
marianne had now been brought by degrees so much into the habit of going out every day that it was become a matter of indifference to her whether she went or not and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening's engagement though without expecting the smallest amusement from any and very often without knowing till the last moment where it was to take her,1,1,0.9560544377638126
as john dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else and a thought struck him during the evening which he communicated to his wife for her approbation when they got home the consideration of mrs dennison's mistake in supposing his sisters their guests had suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such while mrs jenning's engagements kept her from home the expense would be nothing the inconvenience not more and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father fanny was startled at the proposal,1,1,0.9919852462783035
fanny rejoicing in her escape and proud of the ready wit that had procured it wrote the next morning to lucy to request her company and her sister's for some days in harley street as soon as lady middleton could spare them this was enough to make lucy really and reasonably happy mrs dashwood seemed actually working for her herself cherishing all her hopes and promoting all her views such an opportunity of being with edward and his family was above all things the most material to her interest and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings it was an advantage that could not be too gratefully acknowledged nor too speedily made use of and the visit to lady middleton which had not before had any precise limits was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days' time,1,1,0.9980228349854081
the miss steeles removed to harley street and all that reached elinor of their influence there strengthened her expectation of the event sir john who called on them more than once brought home such accounts of the favour they were in as must be universally striking mrs dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life as she was with them had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant called lucy by her christian name and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them,1,1,0.9940440663772602
mrs palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her and contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day returned from that period to her own home and her own habits in which she found the miss dashwoods very ready to resume their former share,1,1,0.9862081128074
that is exactly what i said my dear 'lord ' says i 'is mrs dashwood ill ' so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this mr edward ferrars the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy -- there's for you my dear -- and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except nancy -- could you have believed such a thing possible -- there is no great wonder in their liking one another but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it -- that is strange -- i never happened to see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly well and so this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter -- till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a well-meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out 'lord ' thinks she to herself 'they are all so fond of lucy to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ' and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to make a match between edward and some lord's daughter or other i forget who so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as reached your brother's ears as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on poor soul i pity her and i must say i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do mrs dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes then she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan and mr donavan found the house in all this uproar the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came off poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her lord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it to have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion -- and mr donavan thinks just the same he and i had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too and so she may for what i care i have no pity for either of them i have no notion of people's making such a to-do about money and greatness there is no reason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry for i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well by her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight lord how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids and two men and i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my betty has a sister out of place that would fit them exactly,1,1,0.9934364565805307
she could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last than in the marriage of edward and lucy what mrs ferrars would say and do though there could not be a doubt of its nature she was anxious to hear and still more anxious to know how edward would conduct himself for him she felt much compassion -- for lucy very little -- and it cost her some pains to procure that little -- for the rest of the party none at all,1,1,0.9946276535131772
as mrs jennings could talk on no other subject elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing marianne for its discussion no time was to be lost in undeceiving her in making her acquainted with the real truth and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister or any resentment against edward,1,1,0.9961546723900292
it was not fit that you should then know how much i was the reverse,1,1,0.5795725615165269
by feeling that i was doing my duty -- my promise to lucy obliged me to be secret i owed it to her therefore to avoid giving any hint of the truth and i owed it to my family and friends not to create in them a solicitude about me which it could not be in my power to satisfy,1,1,0.9545564567557562
i understand you -- you do not suppose that i have ever felt much -- for four months marianne i have had all this hanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least -- it was told me -- it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects and told me as i thought with triumph -- this person's suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested -- and it has not been only once -- i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again -- i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection -- nothing has proved him unworthy nor has anything declared him indifferent to me -- i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister and the insolence of his mother and have suffered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages -- and all this has been going on at a time when as you know too well it has not been my only unhappiness -- if you can think me capable of ever feeling -- surely you may suppose that i have suffered now the composure of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the consolation that i have been willing to admit have been the effect of constant and painful exertion -- they did not spring up of themselves -- they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first -- no marianne -- then if i had not been bound to silence perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely -- not even what i owed to my dearest friends -- from openly shewing that i was very unhappy --,1,1,0.9920968659635201
she performed her promise of being discreet to admiration -- she attended to all that mrs jennings had to say upon the subject with an unchanging complexion dissented from her in nothing and was heard three times to say yes ma'am -- she listened to her praise of lucy with only moving from one chair to another and when mrs jennings talked of edward's affection it cost her only a spasm in her throat -- such advances towards heroism in her sister made elinor feel equal to any thing herself,1,1,0.9954890292841759
the next morning brought a farther trial of it in a visit from their brother who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair and bring them news of his wife,1,1,0.7936479359439622
what poor mrs ferrars suffered when first fanny broke it to her is not to be described while she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person -- such a suspicion could never have entered her head if she suspected any prepossession elsewhere it could not be in that quarter 'there to be sure ' said she 'i might have thought myself safe ' she was quite in an agony we consulted together however as to what should be done and at last she determined to send for edward he came but i am sorry to relate what ensued all that mrs ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments and fanny's entreaties was of no avail duty affection every thing was disregarded i never thought edward so stubborn so unfeeling before his mother explained to him her liberal designs in case of his marrying miss morton told him she would settle on him the norfolk estate which clear of land-tax brings in a good thousand a-year offered even when matters grew desperate to make it twelve hundred and in opposition to this if he still persisted in this low connection represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match his own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all she would never see him again and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it,1,1,0.9933403926481986
here marianne in an ecstasy of indignation clapped her hands together and cried gracious god can this be possible,1,1,0.533421503636582
john dashwood was greatly astonished but his nature was calm not open to provocation and he never wished to offend anybody especially anybody of good fortune he therefore replied without any resentment,1,1,0.9524591117268152
i would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours madam miss lucy steele is i dare say a very deserving young woman but in the present case you know the connection must be impossible and to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle's care the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as mrs ferrars is perhaps altogether a little extraordinary in short i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for mrs jennings we all wish her extremely happy and mrs ferrars's conduct throughout the whole has been such as every conscientious good mother in like circumstances would adopt it has been dignified and liberal edward has drawn his own lot and i fear it will be a bad one,1,1,0.9980646432498461
marianne sighed out her similar apprehension and elinor's heart wrung for the feelings of edward while braving his mother's threats for a woman who could not reward him,1,1,0.9384825508551571
well sir said mrs jennings and how did it end,1,1,0.9080763950113576
what indeed ma'am it is a melancholy consideration born to the prospect of such affluence i cannot conceive a situation more deplorable the interest of two thousand pounds -- how can a man live on it -- and when to that is added the recollection that he might but for his own folly within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand five hundred a-year for miss morton has thirty thousand pounds i cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition we must all feel for him and the more so because it is totally out of our power to assist him,1,1,0.9511106372557213
an intimate acquaintance of mrs jennings joined them soon after they entered the gardens and elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them and engaging all mrs jennings's conversation she was herself left to quiet reflection she saw nothing of the willoughbys nothing of edward and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay be interesting to her but at last she found herself with some surprise accosted by miss steele who though looking rather shy expressed great satisfaction in meeting them and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of mrs jennings left her own party for a short time to join their's mrs jennings immediately whispered to elinor,1,1,0.9989446045687175
it was lucky however for mrs jennings's curiosity and elinor's too that she would tell any thing without being asked for nothing would otherwise have been learnt,1,1,0.9771140576094299
i am so glad to meet you said miss steele taking her familiarly by the arm -- for i wanted to see you of all things in the world and then lowering her voice i suppose mrs jennings has heard all about it is she angry,1,1,0.8659617636681864
how cried elinor have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door i am sorry i did not know it before for i certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself how could you behave so unfairly by your sister,1,1,0.9129197984602272
elinor tried to talk of something else but miss steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes from what was uppermost in her mind,1,1,0.9337137307308061
miss steele was going to reply on the same subject but the approach of her own party made another more necessary,1,1,0.9386926379705327
as soon as they returned to the carriage mrs jennings was eager for information but as elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars as she felt assured that lucy for the sake of her own consequence would choose to have known the continuance of their engagement and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end was all her communication and this produced from mrs jennings the following natural remark,1,1,0.997488936902562
i hope my dear miss dashwood will excuse the liberty i take of writing to her but i know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear edward after all the troubles we have went through lately therefore will make no more apologies but proceed to say that thank god though we have suffered dreadfully we are both quite well now and as happy as we must always be in one another's love we have had great trials and great persecutions but however at the same time gratefully acknowledge many friends yourself not the least among them whose great kindness i shall always thankfully remember as will edward too who i have told of it i am sure you will be glad to hear as likewise dear mrs jennings i spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon he would not hear of our parting though earnestly did i as i thought my duty required urge him to it for prudence sake and would have parted for ever on the spot would he consent to it but he said it should never be he did not regard his mother's anger while he could have my affections our prospects are not very bright to be sure but we must wait and hope for the best he will be ordained shortly and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow am very sure you will not forget us and dear mrs jennings too trust she will speak a good word for us to sir john or mr palmer or any friend that may be able to assist us -- poor anne was much to blame for what she did but she did it for the best so i say nothing hope mrs jennings won't think it too much trouble to give us a call should she come this way any morning 'twould be a great kindness and my cousins would be proud to know her -- my paper reminds me to conclude and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her and to sir john and lady middleton and the dear children when you chance to see them and love to miss marianne,1,1,0.9962243751632871
cleveland -- she cried with great agitation no i cannot go to cleveland --,1,1,0.8138876580831907
mrs jennings was so far from being weary of her guest that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from cleveland elinor was grateful for the attention but it could not alter her design and their mother's concurrence being readily gained every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be -- and marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from barton,1,1,0.9909182761281319
i shall always think myself very much obliged to you,1,1,0.8003993551205789
elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater had the colonel been really making her an offer of his hand the preferment which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for edward was already provided to enable him to marry -- and she of all people in the world was fixed on to bestow it -- her emotion was such as mrs jennings had attributed to a very different cause -- but whatever minor feelings less pure less pleasing might have a share in that emotion her esteem for the general benevolence and her gratitude for the particular friendship which together prompted colonel brandon to this act were strongly felt and warmly expressed she thanked him for it with all her heart spoke of edward's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another but at the same time she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself it was an office in short from which unwilling to give edward the pain of receiving an obligation from her she would have been very glad to be spared herself -- but colonel brandon on motives of equal delicacy declining it likewise still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means that she would not on any account make farther opposition edward she believed was still in town and fortunately she had heard his address from miss steele she could undertake therefore to inform him of it in the course of the day after this had been settled colonel brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour and then it was that he mentioned with regret that the house was small and indifferent -- an evil which elinor as mrs jennings had supposed her to do made very light of at least as far as regarded its size,1,1,0.999396426406446
well miss dashwood said mrs jennings sagaciously smiling as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn i do not ask you what the colonel has been saying to you for though upon my honour i tried to keep out of hearing i could not help catching enough to understand his business and i assure you i never was better pleased in my life and i wish you joy of it with all my heart,1,1,0.944461762427334
opportunity repeated mrs jennings -- oh as to that when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity well my dear i wish you joy of it again and again and if ever there was a happy couple in the world i think i shall soon know where to look for them,1,1,0.871603508142617
they were interrupted by the servant's coming in to announce the carriage being at the door and mrs jennings immediately preparing to go said --,1,1,0.9210393727297882
this speech at first puzzled mrs jennings exceedingly why mr ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry she could not immediately comprehend a few moments' reflection however produced a very happy idea and she exclaimed --,1,1,0.987753217012804
oh ho -- i understand you mr ferrars is to be the man well so much the better for him ay to be sure he must be ordained in readiness and i am very glad to find things are so forward between you but my dear is not this rather out of character should not the colonel write himself -- sure he is the proper person,1,1,0.919102493742382
how she should begin -- how she should express herself in her note to edward was now all her concern the particular circumstances between them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world but she equally feared to say too much or too little and sat deliberating over her paper with the pen in her band till broken in on by the entrance of edward himself,1,1,0.9546754898364532
he had met mrs jennings at the door in her way to the carriage as he came to leave his farewell card and she after apologising for not returning herself had obliged him to enter by saying that miss dashwood was above and wanted to speak with him on very particular business,1,1,0.9719323587360048
mrs jennings told me said he that you wished to speak with me at least i understood her so -- or i certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner though at the same time i should have been extremely sorry to leave london without seeing you and your sister especially as it will most likely be some time -- it is not probable that i should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again i go to oxford tomorrow,1,1,0.9874993601854144
yes continued elinor gathering more resolution as some of the worst was over colonel brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed -- for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you -- a concern which i am sure marianne myself and all your friends must share and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion,1,1,0.9892234825619682
the unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where,1,1,0.7321763275409313
truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of edward that she acknowledged it with hesitation which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it for a short time he sat deep in thought after elinor had ceased to speak -- at last and as if it were rather an effort he said,1,1,0.9403636664768044
i must hurry away then to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give you to assure him that he has made me a very -- an exceedingly happy man,1,1,0.7694822689386753
elinor did not offer to detain him and they parted with a very earnest assurance on her side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him on his with rather an attempt to return the same good will than the power of expressing it,1,1,0.9411777712270567
the colonel is a ninny my dear because he has two thousand a-year himself he thinks that nobody else can marry on less take my word for it that if i am alive i shall be paying a visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas and i am sure i sha'nt go if lucy an't there,1,1,0.9165624337073212
very well -- and for the next presentation to a living of that value -- supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly and likely to vacate it soon -- he might have got i dare say -- fourteen hundred pounds and how came he not to have settled that matter before this person's death -- now indeed it would be too late to sell it but a man of colonel brandon's sense -- i wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common such natural concern -- well i am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character i suppose however -- on recollection -- that the case may probably be this edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough to take it -- aye aye that is the fact depend upon it,1,1,0.9289837731598297
elinor contradicted it however very positively and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from colonel brandon to edward and therefore must understand the terms on which it was given obliged him to submit to her authority,1,1,0.9868444936631192
ah elinor said john your reasoning is very good but it is founded on ignorance of human nature when edward's unhappy match takes place depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him and therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event must be concealed from her as much as possible mrs ferrars can never forget that edward is her son,1,1,0.9895602397722677
you wrong her exceedingly mrs ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world,1,1,0.8725426650215008
we think now -- said mr dashwood after a short pause of robert's marrying miss morton,1,1,0.9756711412216708
he had just settled this point with great composure when the entrance of mrs john dashwood put an end to the subject but though she never spoke of it out of her own family elinor could see its influence on her mind in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself she even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town as she had hoped to see more of them -- an exertion in which her husband who attended her into the room and hung enamoured over her accents seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful,1,1,0.9967137410306416
cleveland was a spacious modern-built house situated on a sloping lawn it had no park but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably extensive and like every other place of the same degree of importance it had its open shrubbery and closer wood walk a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation led to the front the lawn was dotted over with timber the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir the mountain-ash and the acacia and a thick screen of them altogether interspersed with tall lombardy poplars shut out the offices,1,0,0.2441553498942091
nothing was wanting on mrs palmer's side that constant and friendly good humour could do to make them feel themselves welcome the openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms of politeness her kindness recommended by so pretty a face was engaging her folly though evident was not disgusting because it was not conceited and elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh,1,1,0.989084271469018
elinor had seen so little of mr palmer and in that little had seen so much variety in his address to her sister and herself that she knew not what to expect to find him in his own family she found him however perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion and only prevented from being so always by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general as he must feel himself to be to mrs jennings and charlotte for the rest of his character and habits they were marked as far as elinor could perceive with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life he was nice in his eating uncertain in his hours fond of his child though affecting to slight it and idled away the mornings at billiards which ought to have been devoted to business she liked him however upon the whole much better than she had expected and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more -- not sorry to be driven by the observation of his epicurism his selfishness and his conceit to rest with complacency on the remembrance of edward's generous temper simple taste and diffident feelings,1,1,0.9930505425502612
two days passed away from the time of mr palmer's departure and her situation continued with little variation the same mr harris who attended her every day still talked boldly of a speedy recovery and miss dashwood was equally sanguine but the expectation of the others was by no means so cheerful mrs jennings had determined very early in the seizure that marianne would never get over it and colonel brandon who was chiefly of use in listening to mrs jennings's forebodings was not in a state of mind to resist their influence he tried to reason himself out of fears which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see marianne no more,1,1,0.9979506205559014
on the morning of the third day however the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away for when mr harris arrived he declared his patient materially better her pulse was much stronger and every symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit elinor confirmed in every pleasant hope was all cheerfulness rejoicing that in her letters to her mother she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend's in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at cleveland and almost fixing on the time when marianne would be able to travel,1,1,0.986927465384092
the repose of the latter became more and more disturbed and her sister who watched with unremitting attention her continual change of posture and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber when marianne suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house started hastily up and with feverish wildness cried out --,1,1,0.7998078701772606
mr harris was punctual in his second visit -- but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce his medicines had failed -- the fever was unabated and marianne only more quiet -- not more herself -- remained in a heavy stupor elinor catching all and more than all his fears in a moment proposed to call in further advice but he judged it unnecessary he had still something more to try some more fresh application of whose success he was as confident as the last and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear but could not enter the heart of miss dashwood she was calm except when she thought of her mother but she was almost hopeless and in this state she continued till noon scarcely stirring from her sister's bed her thoughts wandering from one image of grief one suffering friend to another and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of mrs jennings who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which marianne's disappointment had brought on elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea and it gave fresh misery to her reflections,1,1,0.992289652328782
the bustle in the vestibule as she passed along an inner lobby assured her that they were already in the house she rushed to the drawing-room -- she entered it -- and saw only willoughby,1,1,0.7849636829376717
miss dashwood for half an hour -- for ten minutes -- i entreat you to stay,1,1,0.9047220583743409
with me -- in the utmost amazement -- well sir -- be quick -- and if you can -- less violent,1,1,0.5571294096433437
he was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation and seemed not to hear her,1,0,0.35745866755330497
for god's sake tell me is she out of danger or is she not,1,0,0.3682344361351197
i do not know said he after a pause of expectation on her side and thoughtfulness on his own -- how you may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me -- perhaps you will hardly think the better of me -- it is worth the trial however and you shall hear every thing when i first became intimate in your family i had no other intention no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while i was obliged to remain in devonshire more pleasantly than i had ever done before your sister's lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me and her behaviour to me almost from the first was of a kind -- it is astonishing when i reflect on what it was and what she was that my heart should have been so insensible but at first i must confess my vanity only was elevated by it careless of her happiness thinking only of my own amusement giving way to feelings which i had always been too much in the habit of indulging i endeavoured by every means in my power to make myself pleasing to her without any design of returning her affection,1,1,0.9929363896198217
miss dashwood at this point turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt stopped him by saying,1,1,0.7981538626533898
it is hardly worth while mr willoughby for you to relate or for me to listen any longer such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing -- do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject,1,1,0.904202149785447
i insist on you hearing the whole of it he replied my fortune was never large and i had always been expensive always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself every year since my coming of age or even before i believe had added to my debts and though the death of my old cousin mrs smith was to set me free yet that event being uncertain and possibly far distant it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune to attach myself to your sister therefore was not a thing to be thought of -- and with a meanness selfishness cruelty -- which no indignant no contemptuous look even of yours miss dashwood can ever reprobate too much -- i was acting in this manner trying to engage her regard without a thought of returning it -- but one thing may be said for me even in that horrid state of selfish vanity i did not know the extent of the injury i meditated because i did not then know what it was to love but have i ever known it -- well may it be doubted for had i really loved could i have sacrificed my feelings to vanity to avarice -- or what is more could i have sacrificed hers -- but i have done it to avoid a comparative poverty which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors i have by raising myself to affluence lost every thing that could make it a blessing,1,1,0.97995811558748
to have resisted such attractions to have withstood such tenderness -- is there a man on earth who could have done it -- yes i found myself by insensible degrees sincerely fond of her and the happiest hours of my life were what i spent with her when i felt my intentions were strictly honourable and my feelings blameless even then however when fully determined on paying my addresses to her i allowed myself most improperly to put off from day to day the moment of doing it from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed i will not reason here -- nor will i stop for you to expatiate on the absurdity and the worse than absurdity of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound the event has proved that i was a cunning fool providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever at last however my resolution was taken and i had determined as soon as i could engage her alone to justify the attentions i had so invariably paid her and openly assure her of an affection which i had already taken such pains to display but in the interim -- in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass before i could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private -- a circumstance occurred -- an unlucky circumstance to ruin all my resolution and with it all my comfort a discovery took place -- here he hesitated and looked down -- mrs smith had somehow or other been informed i imagine by some distant relation whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour of an affair a connection -- but i need not explain myself farther he added looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye -- your particular intimacy -- you have probably heard the whole story long ago,1,1,0.9863848968084101
but upon my soul i did not know it he warmly replied i did not recollect that i had omitted to give her my direction and common sense might have told her how to find it out,1,1,0.7767571184414905
when the first of hers reached me as it immediately did for i was in town the whole time what i felt is -- in the common phrase not to be expressed in a more simple one -- perhaps too simple to raise any emotion -- my feelings were very very painful -- every line every word was -- in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer were she here would forbid -- a dagger to my heart to know that marianne was in town was -- in the same language -- a thunderbolt -- thunderbolts and daggers -- what a reproof would she have given me -- her taste her opinions -- i believe they are better known to me than my own -- and i am sure they are dearer,1,1,0.9290001315154097
a short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded willoughby first rousing himself broke it thus,1,1,0.7102657823632703
yes yes that in particular your sister wrote to me again you know the very next morning you saw what she said i was breakfasting at the ellisons -- and her letter with some others was brought to me there from my lodgings it happened to catch sophia's eye before it caught mine -- and its size the elegance of the paper the hand-writing altogether immediately gave her a suspicion some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in devonshire and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was and made her more jealous than ever affecting that air of playfulness therefore which is delightful in a woman one loves she opened the letter directly and read its contents she was well paid for her impudence she read what made her wretched her wretchedness i could have borne but her passion -- her malice -- at all events it must be appeased and in short -- what do you think of my wife's style of letter-writing -- delicate -- tender -- truly feminine -- was it not,1,1,0.9681006846341523
your wife -- the letter was in your own hand-writing,1,1,0.5583190004648314
you are very wrong mr willoughby very blamable said elinor while her voice in spite of herself betrayed her compassionate emotion you ought not to speak in this way either of mrs willoughby or my sister you had made your own choice it was not forced on you your wife has a claim to your politeness to your respect at least she must be attached to you or she would not have married you to treat her with unkindness to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to marianne -- nor can i suppose it a relief to your own conscience,1,1,0.9880137808393676
i will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called your justification but you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now nor how you heard of her illness,1,1,0.624299724839469
elinor assured him that she did -- that she forgave pitied wished him well -- was even interested in his happiness -- and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it his answer was not very encouraging,1,1,0.9672159307589924
but she will be gained by some one else and if that some one should be the very he whom of all others i could least bear -- but i will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill by shewing that where i have most injured i can least forgive good bye -- god bless you,1,1,0.7960475269589672
and with these words he almost ran out of the room,1,0,0.12360618846122601
at last we are alone my elinor you do not yet know all my happiness colonel brandon loves marianne he has told me so himself,1,1,0.9366303905360669
elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age characters or feelings could be given -- but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject and therefore instead of an inquiry she passed it off with a smile,1,1,0.9643792661597014
here however elinor perceived -- not the language not the professions of colonel brandon but the natural embellishments of her mother's active fancy which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose,1,1,0.9609523162487336
i know it is -- replied her mother seriously or after such a warning i should be the last to encourage such affection or even to be pleased by it but his coming for me as he did with such active such ready friendship is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men,1,1,0.7422354296306977
and his manners the colonel's manners are not only more pleasing to me than willoughby's ever were but they are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne their gentleness their genuine attention to other people and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition than the liveliness -- often artificial and often ill-timed of the other i am very sure myself that had willoughby turned out as really amiable as he has proved himself the contrary marianne would yet never have been so happy with him as she will be with colonel brandon,1,1,0.9855321725531057
at delaford she will be within an easy distance of me added mrs dashwood even if i remain at barton and in all probability -- for i hear it is a large village -- indeed there certainly must be some small house or cottage close by that would suit us quite as well as our present situation,1,1,0.9511249563556414
marianne's illness though weakening in its kind had not been long enough to make her recovery slow and with youth natural strength and her mother's presence in aid it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove within four days after the arrival of the latter into mrs palmer's dressing-room when there at her own particular request for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother colonel brandon was invited to visit her,1,1,0.9725943082551607
as they approached barton indeed and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar some painful recollection she grew silent and thoughtful and turning away her face from their notice sat earnestly gazing through the window but here elinor could neither wonder nor blame and when she saw as she assisted marianne from the carriage that she had been crying she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise in the whole of her subsequent manner she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion for no sooner had they entered their common sitting-room than marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of every object with which the remembrance of willoughby could be connected -- she said little but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness and though a sigh sometimes escaped her it never passed away without the atonement of a smile after dinner she would try her piano-forte she went to it but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera procured for her by willoughby containing some of their favourite duets and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his hand-writing -- that would not do -- she shook her head put the music aside and after running over the keys for a minute complained of feebleness in her fingers and closed the instrument again declaring however with firmness as she did so that she should in future practice much,1,1,0.976657146829846
the next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms on the contrary with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit anticipating the pleasure of margaret's return and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society as the only happiness worth a wish,1,1,0.9721234177447332
elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self-control her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to willoughby was yet unfulfilled and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of marianne and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity willing therefore to delay the evil hour she resolved to wait till her sister's health were more secure before she appointed it but the resolution was made only to be broken,1,1,0.9869231288691174
marianne had been two or three days at home before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out but at last a soft genial morning appeared such as might tempt the daughter's wishes and the mother's confidence and marianne leaning on elinor's arm was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue in the lane before the house,1,1,0.9620718370709783
her voice sunk with the word but presently reviving she added,1,1,0.6068122074050951
i am thankful to find that i can look with so little pain on the spot -- shall we ever talk on that subject elinor -- hesitatingly it was said -- or will it be wrong -- i can talk of it now i hope as i ought to do --,1,1,0.8298119180696617
she stopt elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered,1,1,0.7625810338047521
if you could be assured of that you think you should be easy,1,1,0.7823527117995498
i would suppose him -- oh how gladly would i suppose him only fickle very very fickle,1,1,0.6447366097930485
elinor who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration without feeling at all nearer decision than at first heard this and perceiving that as reflection did nothing resolution must do all soon found herself leading to the fact,1,1,0.9356712067484027
i wish to assure you both said she that i see every thing -- as you can desire me to do,1,1,0.7425366133758714
it is a great relief to me -- what elinor told me this morning -- i have now heard exactly what i wished to hear -- for some moments her voice was lost but recovering herself she added and with greater calmness than before -- i am now perfectly satisfied i wish for no change i never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later i must have known all this -- i should have had no confidence no esteem nothing could have done it away to my feelings,1,1,0.9813573737086747
marianne's lips quivered and she repeated the word selfish in a tone that implied -- do you really think him selfish,1,1,0.7354238977857677
the whole of his behaviour replied elinor from the beginning to the end of the affair has been grounded on selfishness it was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections which afterwards when his own were engaged made him delay the confession of it and which finally carried him from barton his own enjoyment or his own ease was in every particular his ruling principle,1,1,0.9292363783379257
i have not a doubt of it said marianne and i have nothing to regret -- nothing but my own folly,1,1,0.921963776135691
thomas's intelligence seemed over elinor looked as if she wished to hear more,1,1,0.9345545643535265
mrs dashwood could think of no other question and thomas and the tablecloth now alike needless were soon afterwards dismissed marianne had already sent to say that she should eat nothing more mrs dashwood's and elinor's appetites were equally lost and margaret might think herself very well off that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before,1,1,0.9940644144444586
elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event however certain the mind may be told to consider it and certainty itself she now found that in spite of herself she had always admitted a hope while edward remained single that something would occur to prevent his marrying lucy that some resolution of his own some mediation of friends or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady would arise to assist the happiness of all but he was now married and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence,1,1,0.9937284705196907
they would soon she supposed be settled at delaford -- delaford -- that place in which so much conspired to give her an interest which she wished to be acquainted with and yet desired to avoid she saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house saw in lucy the active contriving manager uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices -- pursuing her own interest in every thought courting the favour of colonel brandon of mrs jennings and of every wealthy friend in edward -- she knew not what she saw nor what she wished to see -- happy or unhappy -- nothing pleased her she turned away her head from every sketch of him,1,1,0.994349202891356
his words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but elinor who sat with her head leaning over her work in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was,1,1,0.665081041003785
elinor could sit it no longer she almost ran out of the room and as soon as the door was closed burst into tears of joy which at first she thought would never cease edward who had till then looked any where rather than at her saw her hurry away and perhaps saw -- or even heard her emotion for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie which no remarks no inquiries no affectionate address of mrs dashwood could penetrate and at last without saying a word quitted the room and walked out towards the village -- leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation so wonderful and so sudden -- a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures,1,1,0.9419859698052152
but elinor -- how are her feelings to be described -- from the moment of learning that lucy was married to another that edward was free to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed she was every thing by turns but tranquil but when the second moment had passed when she found every doubt every solicitude removed compared her situation with what so lately it had been -- saw him honourably released from his former engagement saw him instantly profiting by the release to address herself and declare an affection as tender as constant as she had ever supposed it to be -- she was oppressed she was overcome by her own felicity -- and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits or any degree of tranquillity to her heart,1,1,0.9966150174590099
lucy's marriage the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers -- and elinor's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard how they could be thrown together and by what attraction robert could be drawn on to marry a girl of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration -- a girl too already engaged to his brother and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family -- it was beyond her comprehension to make out to her own heart it was a delightful affair to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one but to her reason her judgment it was completely a puzzle,1,1,0.9899517776084753
being very sure i have long lost your affections i have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another and have no doubt of being as happy with him as i once used to think i might be with you but i scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another's sincerely wish you happy in your choice and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends as our near relationship now makes proper i can safely say i owe you no ill-will and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices your brother has gained my affections entirely and as we could not live without one another we are just returned from the altar and are now on our way to dawlish for a few weeks which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see but thought i would first trouble you with these few lines and shall always remain,1,1,0.8997782187640244
edward heard with pleasure of colonel brandon's being expected at the cottage as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of delaford -- which at present said he after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven him for offering,1,1,0.9833996497337444
edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him and on that he rested for the residue of their income but elinor had no such dependence for since edward would still be unable to marry miss morton and his chusing herself had been spoken of in mrs ferrars's flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing lucy steele she feared that robert's offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich fanny,1,1,0.9969068478965482
about four days after edward's arrival colonel brandon appeared to complete mrs dashwood's satisfaction and to give her the dignity of having for the first time since her living at barton more company with her than her house would hold edward was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer and colonel brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the park from whence he usually returned in the morning early enough to interrupt the lovers' first tete-a-tete before breakfast,1,1,0.9785524697720903
mrs ferrars has never yet mentioned edward's name which does not surprise us but to our great astonishment not a line has been received from him on the occasion perhaps however he is kept silent by his fear of offending and i shall therefore give him a hint by a line to oxford that his sister and i both think a letter of proper submission from him addressed perhaps to fanny and by her shewn to her mother might not be taken amiss for we all know the tenderness of mrs ferrars's heart and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children,1,1,0.9923310884513652
what she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered and here it plainly appeared that though edward was now her only son he was by no means her eldest for while robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year not the smallest objection was made against edward's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost nor was anything promised either for the present or in future beyond the ten thousand pounds which had been given with fanny,1,1,0.9820762940007506
with an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them they had nothing to wait for after edward was in possession of the living but the readiness of the house to which colonel brandon with an eager desire for the accommodation of elinor was making considerable improvements and after waiting some time for their completion after experiencing as usual a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen elinor as usual broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready and the ceremony took place in barton church early in the autumn,1,1,0.9543163404358437
with such a confederacy against her -- with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness -- with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself which at last though long after it was observable to everybody else -- burst on her -- what could she do,1,1,0.9162065819530285
marianne dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate she was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions and to counteract by her conduct her most favourite maxims she was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship voluntarily to give her hand to another -- and that other a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment whom two years before she had considered too old to be married -- and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat,1,1,0.981290225025402
but so it was instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting -- instead of remaining even for ever with her mother and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on -- she found herself at nineteen submitting to new attachments entering on new duties placed in a new home a wife the mistress of a family and the patroness of a village,1,1,0.9440002286211677
for marianne however -- in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss -- he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman -- and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after-days as bearing no comparison with mrs brandon,1,1,0.9670978935825894
mrs dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage without attempting a removal to delaford and fortunately for sir john and mrs jennings when marianne was taken from them margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover,1,1,0.9959603944086728

there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself 'oh dear oh dear i shall be late ' when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge,0,0,0.086790848484301
either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled 'orange marmalade' but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it,0,0,0.26347565786193716
there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again,0,0,0.14186253116292147
'what a curious feeling ' said alice 'i must be shutting up like a telescope ',0,0,0.09658388255216507
'curiouser and curiouser ' cried alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english 'now i'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was good-bye feet ' for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off 'oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears i'm sure i shan't be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can -- but i must be kind to them ' thought alice 'or perhaps they won't walk the way i want to go let me see i'll give them a new pair of boots every christmas ',0,0,0.16253362834178378
'i'm sure i'm not ada ' she said 'for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all and i'm sure i can't be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little besides she's she and i'm i and -- oh dear how puzzling it all is i'll try if i know all the things i used to know let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is -- oh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate however the multiplication table doesn't signify let's try geography london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and rome -- no that's all wrong i'm certain i must have been changed for mabel i'll try and say how doth the little -- ' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do --,0,0,0.22883341432505241
'i'm sure those are not the right words ' said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on 'i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn no i've made up my mind about it if i'm mabel i'll stay down here it'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear i shall only look up and say who am i then tell me that first and then if i like being that person i'll come up if not i'll stay down here till i'm somebody else -- but oh dear ' cried alice with a sudden burst of tears 'i do wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired of being all alone here ',0,0,0.1090646727029208
as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking 'how can i have done that ' she thought 'i must be growing small again ' she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether,0,0,0.3514932673858133
'i wish i hadn't cried so much ' said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out 'i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure however everything is queer to-day ',0,0,0.26115160288133293
'found it ' the mouse replied rather crossly 'of course you know what it means ',0,0,0.27433798838519113
'but she must have a prize herself you know ' said the mouse,0,0,0.37359421086697747
'you promised to tell me your history you know ' said alice 'and why it is you hate -- c and d ' she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again,0,0,0.24318213126765198
'mine is a long and a sad tale ' said the mouse turning to alice and sighing,0,0,0.0445158448127269
'i had not ' cried the mouse sharply and very angrily,0,0,0.07650610657074622
'how queer it seems ' alice said to herself 'to be going messages for a rabbit i suppose dinah'll be sending me on messages next ' and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen ' miss alice come here directly and get ready for your walk coming in a minute nurse but i've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out only i don't think ' alice went on 'that they'd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that ',0,0,0.02648591304227973
and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen,0,0,0.4336140437092997
'sure it does yer honour but it's an arm for all that ',0,0,0.325546635098355
there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself 'i wonder what they will do next if they had any sense they'd take the roof off ' after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say 'a barrowful will do to begin with ',0,0,0.08876306987108346
'the first thing i've got to do ' said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood 'is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i think that will be the best plan ',0,0,0.11369762291884672
the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice,0,0,0.04378658812980681
'i can't explain myself i'm afraid sir' said alice 'because i'm not myself you see ',0,0,0.10447925866686937
'well perhaps you haven't found it so yet ' said alice 'but when you have to turn into a chrysalis -- you will some day you know -- and then after that into a butterfly i should think you'll feel it a little queer won't you ',0,0,0.07141597333927065
'you ' said the caterpillar contemptuously 'who are you ',0,0,0.14439299351458787
which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar's making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely 'i think you ought to tell me who you are first ',0,0,0.4039985627329892
this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again,0,0,0.13250321873374585
'can't remember what things ' said the caterpillar,0,0,0.13120423437773548
'repeat you are old father william ' said the caterpillar,0,0,0.16460112208524386
'you are old father william ' the young man said 'and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head -- do you think at your age it is right ',0,0,0.0946634369409521
'in my youth ' father william replied to his son 'i feared it might injure the brain but now that i'm perfectly sure i have none why i do it again and again ',0,1,0.6041448934489183
'you are old ' said the youth 'one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose -- what made you so awfully clever ',0,0,0.17743201665762443
'well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldn't mind ' said alice 'three inches is such a wretched height to be ',0,0,0.14533846586607704
'it is a very good height indeed ' said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high,0,0,0.18276555512234188
'one side of what the other side of what ' thought alice to herself,0,0,0.15760179537084654
'i haven't the least idea what you're talking about ' said alice,0,0,0.04373739711964415
'i've tried the roots of trees and i've tried banks and i've tried hedges ' the pigeon went on without attending to her 'but those serpents there's no pleasing them ',0,0,0.07546390551914191
alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished,0,0,0.23724439442972722
'i don't believe it ' said the pigeon 'but if they do why then they're a kind of serpent that's all i can say ',0,0,0.059037141579932166
'there might be some sense in your knocking ' the footman went on without attending to her 'if we had the door between us for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know ' he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil 'but perhaps he can't help it ' she said to herself 'his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head but at any rate he might answer questions -- how am i to get in ' she repeated aloud,0,0,0.16158599918261332
'i shall sit here ' the footman remarked 'till tomorrow -- ',0,0,0.15132650931221178

'are you to get in at all ' said the footman 'that's the first question you know ',0,0,0.1932459886487691
there was certainly too much of it in the air even the duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear,0,0,0.13231283094028978
'if everybody minded their own business ' the duchess said in a hoarse growl 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does ',0,0,0.2179179907428399
'talking of axes ' said the duchess 'chop off her head ',0,0,0.15173473714983907
alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again 'twenty-four hours i think or is it twelve i -- ',0,0,0.21586460579615815
'oh don't bother me ' said the duchess 'i never could abide figures ' and with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line,0,0,0.25754602878256405
'i speak severely to my boy i beat him when he sneezes for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases ',0,0,0.36653944031425273
'here you may nurse it a bit if you like ' the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke 'i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen ' and she hurried out of the room the cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out but it just missed her,0,0,0.08164397682537082
alice was just beginning to think to herself 'now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home ' when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further,0,0,0.43066509396509156
alice didn't think that proved it at all however she went on 'and how do you know that you're mad ',0,0,0.04397526997435686
'to begin with ' said the cat 'a dog's not mad you grant that ',0,0,0.06686651913122242
'i should like it very much ' said alice 'but i haven't been invited yet ',0,0,0.16590281933433823
'i thought it would ' said the cat and vanished again,0,0,0.095455533405162
alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live 'i've seen hatters before ' she said to herself 'the march hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it won't be raving mad -- at least not so mad as it was in march ' as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a tree,0,0,0.06154371639949249
'i said pig ' replied alice 'and i wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy ',0,0,0.0853082044642363
'all right ' said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone,0,0,0.07080835385697862
alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea 'i don't see any wine ' she remarked,0,0,0.051342086114568725
the hatter was the first to break the silence 'what day of the month is it ' he said turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear,0,0,0.04326031049092789
'which is just the case with mine ' said the hatter,0,0,0.07864831704922065
alice felt dreadfully puzzled the hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english 'i don't quite understand you ' she said as politely as she could,0,0,0.10914419159034762
'the dormouse is asleep again ' said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose,0,0,0.03925862581176769
'yes that's it ' said the hatter with a sigh 'it's always tea-time and we've no time to wash the things between whiles ',0,0,0.09445859012285986
'take some more tea ' the march hare said to alice very earnestly,0,0,0.05650596852651137
'there's no such thing ' alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went 'sh sh ' and the dormouse sulkily remarked 'if you can't be civil you'd better finish the story for yourself ',0,0,0.04388938343806342
he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the march hare moved into the dormouse's place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate,0,0,0.018181762304352322
this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot,0,0,0.2880812547456396
seven flung down his brush and had just begun 'well of all the unjust things -- ' when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low,0,0,0.0751708645308531
when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely 'who is this ' she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply,0,0,0.08358240117665704
'my name is alice so please your majesty ' said alice very politely but she added to herself 'why they're only a pack of cards after all i needn't be afraid of them ',0,0,0.0733031956005843
'and who are these ' said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children,0,0,0.06437928007298112
'that's right ' shouted the queen 'can you play croquet ',0,0,0.04054062941570231

the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting 'off with his head ' or 'off with her head ' about once in a minute,0,0,0.06356508803008616
'i don't like the look of it at all ' said the king 'however it may kiss my hand if it likes ',0,0,0.0765559062717838
the queen's argument was that if something wasn't done about it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed all round it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious,0,0,0.25874235829272874
'when i'm a duchess ' she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though 'i won't have any pepper in my kitchen at all soup does very well without -- maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered ' she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule 'and vinegar that makes them sour -- and camomile that makes them bitter -- and -- and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered i only wish people knew that then they wouldn't be so stingy about it you know -- ',0,0,0.26291052326448183
she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear 'you're thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk i can't tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit ',0,0,0.18705376758169245
'tut tut child ' said the duchess 'everything's got a moral if only you can find it ' and she squeezed herself up closer to alice's side as she spoke,0,0,0.13430285885753526
''tis so ' said the duchess 'and the moral of that is -- oh 'tis love 'tis love that makes the world go round ',0,0,0.035283794927856424
'how fond she is of finding morals in things ' alice thought to herself,0,0,0.3712675172849098
'very true ' said the duchess 'flamingoes and mustard both bite and the moral of that is -- birds of a feather flock together ',0,0,0.09801319518864697
'of course it is ' said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said 'there's a large mustard-mine near here and the moral of that is -- the more there is of mine the less there is of yours ',0,0,0.0688655953004283
'oh i know ' exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark 'it's a vegetable it doesn't look like one but it is ',0,0,0.19780389822320715
'that's nothing to what i could say if i chose ' the duchess replied in a pleased tone,0,0,0.4765350163220289
'just about as much right ' said the duchess 'as pigs have to fly and the m -- ',0,0,0.11254197268264375
but here to alice's great surprise the duchess's voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word 'moral ' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm,0,0,0.01871843381755353
'a fine day your majesty ' the duchess began in a low weak voice,0,0,0.07665083523244622

all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting 'off with his head ' or 'off with her head ' those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution,0,0,0.06838845790514486
'i'll tell it her ' said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone 'sit down both of you and don't speak a word till i've finished ',0,0,0.020491036524678086

the editorial office of the atheist had for some years past become less and less prominently interesting as a feature of ludgate hill the paper was unsuited to the atmosphere it showed an interest in the bible unknown in the district and a knowledge of that volume to which nobody else on ludgate hill could make any conspicuous claim it was in vain that the editor of the atheist filled his front window with fierce and final demands as to what noah in the ark did with the neck of the giraffe it was in vain that he asked violently as for the last time how the statement god is spirit could be reconciled with the statement the earth is his footstool it was in vain that he cried with an accusing energy that the bishop of london was paid l12 000 a year for pretending to believe that the whale swallowed jonah it was in vain that he hung in conspicuous places the most thrilling scientific calculations about the width of the throat of a whale was it nothing to them all they that passed by did his sudden and splendid and truly sincere indignation never stir any of the people pouring down ludgate hill never the little man who edited the atheist would rush from his shop on starlit evenings and shake his fist at st paul's in the passion of his holy war upon the holy place he might have spared his emotion the cross at the top of st paul's and the atheist shop at the foot of it were alike remote from the world the shop and the cross were equally uplifted and alone in the empty heavens,0,0,0.07342728819626805

comrades he began as sharp as a pistol-shot our meeting tonight is important though it need not be long this branch has always had the honour of electing thursdays for the central european council we have elected many and splendid thursdays we all lament the sad decease of the heroic worker who occupied the post until last week as you know his services to the cause were considerable he organised the great dynamite coup of brighton which under happier circumstances ought to have killed everybody on the pier as you also know his death was as self-denying as his life for he died through his faith in a hygienic mixture of chalk and water as a substitute for milk which beverage he regarded as barbaric and as involving cruelty to the cow cruelty or anything approaching to cruelty revolted him always but it is not to acclaim his virtues that we are met but for a harder task it is difficult properly to praise his qualities but it is more difficult to replace them upon you comrades it devolves this evening to choose out of the company present the man who shall be thursday if any comrade suggests a name i will put it to the vote if no comrade suggests a name i can only tell myself that that dear dynamiter who is gone from us has carried into the unknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his innocence,0,0,0.117131710474938

you do not know sunday at all perhaps it is because you are better than i and do not know hell i was a fierce fellow and a trifle morbid from the first the man who sits in darkness and who chose us all chose me because i had all the crazy look of a conspirator -- because my smile went crooked and my eyes were gloomy even when i smiled but there must have been something in me that answered to the nerves in all these anarchic men for when i first saw sunday he expressed to me not your airy vitality but something both gross and sad in the nature of things i found him smoking in a twilight room a room with brown blind down infinitely more depressing than the genial darkness in which our master lives he sat there on a bench a huge heap of a man dark and out of shape he listened to all my words without speaking or even stirring i poured out my most passionate appeals and asked my most eloquent questions then after a long silence the thing began to shake and i thought it was shaken by some secret malady it shook like a loathsome and living jelly it reminded me of everything i had ever read about the base bodies that are the origin of life -- the deep sea lumps and protoplasm it seemed like the final form of matter the most shapeless and the most shameful i could only tell myself from its shudderings that it was something at least that such a monster could be miserable and then it broke upon me that the bestial mountain was shaking with a lonely laughter and the laughter was at me do you ask me to forgive him that it is no small thing to be laughed at by something at once lower and stronger than oneself,0,0,0.024840106744259186
