she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate indulgent father and had in consequence of her sister's marriage been mistress of his house from a very early period her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short of a mother in affection,1,1,0.9588690266013714
sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness -- miss taylor married it was miss taylor's loss which first brought grief it was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance the wedding over and the bride-people gone her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening her father composed himself to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost,1,1,0.9681977186599992
her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony being settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily reach and many a long october and november evening must be struggled through at hartfield before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband and their little children to fill the house and give her pleasant society again,1,1,0.9802641681953737
a house of her own -- but where is the advantage of a house of her own this is three times as large -- and you have never any odd humours my dear,1,1,0.7909355732801374
i am very glad i did think of her it was very lucky for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account and i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil pretty-spoken girl i have a great opinion of her whenever i see her she always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner and when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it i am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know she will be hearing of us he will be able to tell her how we all are,1,1,0.9811290092831891
captain weston who had been considered especially by the churchills as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst of the bargain for when his wife died after a three years' marriage he was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain from the expense of the child however he was soon relieved the boy had with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother's been the means of a sort of reconciliation and mr and mrs churchill having no children of their own nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt but as they were overcome by other considerations the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to improve as he could,1,1,0.9854934475461709
it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects in view till they were accomplished he had made his fortune bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through he had never been an unhappy man his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen to excite gratitude than to feel it,1,1,0.9754856798123284
she knew that at times she must be missed and could not think without pain of emma's losing a single pleasure or suffering an hour's ennui from the want of her companionableness but dear emma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield so convenient for even solitary female walking and in mr weston's disposition and circumstances which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together,1,1,0.9965987623841485
after these came a second set among the most come-at-able of whom were mrs and miss bates and mrs goddard three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield and who were fetched and carried home so often that mr woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses had it taken place only once a year it would have been a grievance,1,1,0.9909261345676492
harriet smith's intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing quick and decided in her ways emma lost no time in inviting encouraging and telling her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased so did their satisfaction in each other as a walking companion emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her in that respect mrs weston's loss had been important her father never went beyond the shrubbery where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk or his short as the year varied and since mrs weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined she had ventured once alone to randalls but it was not pleasant and a harriet smith therefore one whom she could summon at any time to a walk would be a valuable addition to her privileges but in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her and was confirmed in all her kind designs,1,1,0.999413843508926
mrs goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of the school in general formed naturally a great part of the conversation -- and but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey-mill farm it must have been the whole but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal she had spent two very happy months with them and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place emma encouraged her talkativeness -- amused by such a picture of another set of beings and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of mrs martin's having two parlours two very good parlours indeed one of them quite as large as mrs goddard's drawing-room and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years with her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed and of mrs martin's saying as she was so fond of it it should be called her cow and of their having a very handsome summer-house in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink tea -- a very handsome summer-house large enough to hold a dozen people,1,1,0.9917369412784279
well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence mr martin i imagine has his fortune entirely to make -- cannot be at all beforehand with the world whatever money he might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family property it is i dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet,1,1,0.8706903009060011
which makes his good manners the more valuable the older a person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes what is passable in youth is detestable in later age mr martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr weston's time of life,1,1,0.8266840487235644
but there may be pretty good guessing he will be a completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of nothing but profit and loss,1,1,0.7540856554941843
she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at hartfield was foundation enough on his side and on harriet's there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy and he was really a very pleasing young man a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like he was reckoned very handsome his person much admired in general though not by her there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with -- but the girl who could be gratified by a robert martin's riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr elton's admiration,1,1,0.9948680378437229
a bad thing do you really think it a bad thing -- why so,1,0,0.4456672967149029
perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you knowing weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle,1,0,0.37820763701712196
there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that -- said mr knightley feelingly and for a moment or two he had done but i he soon added who have had no such charm thrown over my senses must still see hear and remember emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family at ten years old she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen she was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident and ever since she was twelve emma has been mistress of the house and of you all in her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her she inherits her mother's talents and must have been under subjection to her,1,1,0.989040968658439
i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind but excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma's mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smith's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you pray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself it has been so many years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized mr knightley at this little remains of office,1,1,0.9934076934077181
not at all cried he i am much obliged to you for it it is very good advice and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found for it shall be attended to,1,1,0.8470193915590865
be satisfied said he i will not raise any outcry i will keep my ill-humour to myself i have a very sincere interest in emma isabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a greater interest perhaps hardly so great there is an anxiety a curiosity in what one feels for emma i wonder what will become of her,1,1,0.9774853873205344
she always declares she will never marry which of course means just nothing at all but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object i should like to see emma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom from home,1,1,0.9673351220923762
part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr weston's on the subject as much as possible there were wishes at randalls respecting emma's destiny but it was not desirable to have them suspected and the quiet transition which mr knightley soon afterwards made to what does weston think of the weather shall we have rain convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield,1,1,0.998133545541457
emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriet's fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of mr elton's being a remarkably handsome man with most agreeable manners and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriet's side as there could be any occasion for she was quite convinced of mr elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love if not in love already she had no scruple with regard to him he talked of harriet and praised her so warmly that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add his perception of the striking improvement of harriet's manner since her introduction at hartfield was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment,1,1,0.9996399697338536
no sooner was she out of sight than emma exclaimed,1,1,0.8633703939022849
oh yes i observed it i assure you it was not lost on me but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded,1,1,0.9077694348288441
harriet was soon back again and the proposal almost immediately made and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others emma wished to go to work directly and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits for not one of them had ever been finished that they might decide together on the best size for harriet her many beginnings were displayed miniatures half-lengths whole-lengths pencil crayon and water-colours had been all tried in turn she had always wanted to do every thing and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to she played and sang -- and drew in almost every style but steadiness had always been wanting and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command and ought not to have failed of she was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician but she was not unwilling to have others deceived or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved,1,1,0.9873236386190262
she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait it was to be a whole-length in water-colours like mr john knightley's and was destined if she could please herself to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece,1,1,0.7213068651212277
the same civilities and courtesies the same success and satisfaction took place on the morrow and accompanied the whole progress of the picture which was rapid and happy every body who saw it was pleased but mr elton was in continual raptures and defended it through every criticism,1,1,0.850665203819501
you sir may say any thing cried mr elton but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit any other situation would have been much less in character the naivete of miss smith's manners -- and altogether -- oh it is most admirable i cannot keep my eyes from it i never saw such a likeness,1,1,0.9814871958769227
the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed and here were a few difficulties it must be done directly it must be done in london the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on and isabella the usual doer of all commissions must not be applied to because it was december and mr woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of december but no sooner was the distress known to mr elton than it was removed his gallantry was always on the alert might he be trusted with the commission what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it he could ride to london at any time it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand,1,1,0.9821426976501119
mr elton was to take the drawing to london chuse the frame and give the directions and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough,1,1,0.8921637588493061
what a precious deposit said he with a tender sigh as he received it,1,0,0.4781942607435613
emma was not sorry to be pressed she read and was surprized the style of the letter was much above her expectation there were not merely no grammatical errors but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman the language though plain was strong and unaffected and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer it was short but expressed good sense warm attachment liberality propriety even delicacy of feeling she paused over it while harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion with a well well and was at last forced to add is it a good letter or is it too short,1,1,0.9903500503154014
well said the still waiting harriet -- well -- and -- and what shall i do,1,1,0.614170641731825
you think i ought to refuse him then said harriet looking down,1,1,0.6614379622552343
you are expecting her again you say this morning,1,1,0.6768227249800565
emma was more than half in hopes of mr elton's having dropt a hint mr knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser and she knew mr elton looked up to him,1,1,0.9859169610508265
he is very obliging said emma but is he sure that harriet means to marry him,1,1,0.9770402134212135
oh to be sure cried emma it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her,1,1,0.7778854499987083
to be sure cried she playfully i know that is the feeling of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment oh harriet may pick and chuse were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives no -- pray let her have time to look about her,1,1,0.9071752219643415
nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked cried mr knightley -- robert martin's manners have sense sincerity and good-humour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand,1,1,0.9840216782463046
in this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon miss nash head-teacher at mrs goddard's had written out at least three hundred and harriet who had taken the first hint of it from her hoped with miss woodhouse's help to get a great many more emma assisted with her invention memory and taste and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order in form as well as quantity,1,1,0.9801816296986114
my first doth affliction denote which my second is destin'd to feel and my whole is the best antidote that affliction to soften and heal --,1,0,0.40222995766259934
made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already,1,1,0.7493338424467311
why will not you write one yourself for us mr elton said she that is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be easier to you,1,1,0.7655198977475764
oh no he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind in his life the stupidest fellow he was afraid not even miss woodhouse -- he stopt a moment -- or miss smith could inspire him,1,1,0.945940615155193
take it said emma smiling and pushing the paper towards harriet -- it is for you take your own,1,1,0.7968230394781596
she cast her eye over it pondered caught the meaning read it through again to be quite certain and quite mistress of the lines and then passing it to harriet sat happily smiling and saying to herself while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness very well mr elton very well indeed i have read worse charades courtship -- a very good hint i give you credit for it this is feeling your way this is saying very plainly -- pray miss smith give me leave to pay my addresses to you approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance ',1,1,0.978190602406442
harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion she read the concluding lines and was all flutter and happiness she could not speak but she was not wanted to speak it was enough for her to feel emma spoke for her,1,1,0.9826829898216913
yes very true how nicely you talk i love to hear you you understand every thing you and mr elton are one as clever as the other this charade -- if i had studied a twelvemonth i could never have made any thing like it,1,1,0.8957927946270192
leave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book,1,0,0.35387823199279195
harriet submitted though her mind could hardly separate the parts so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love it seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity,1,1,0.9269727295307887
emma only nodded and smiled -- after a little thinking and a very tender sigh he added,1,1,0.7261437331302507
and that is all that i can recollect of it -- but it is very clever all the way through but i think my dear you said you had got it,1,1,0.6187431451575202
aye very true -- i wish i could recollect more of it,1,1,0.8981877879391187
yes my dear if there is time -- but -- in a very depressed tone -- she is coming for only one week there will not be time for any thing,1,1,0.7892940079444724
that is the case with us all papa one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other,1,1,0.534465600187404
you must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two he may be sure of every woman's approbation while he writes with such gallantry,1,1,0.9458640826053896
there it is there go you and your riddle-book one of these days -- harriet's was --,1,1,0.5087210378596599
i do not often walk this way now said emma as they proceeded but then there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part of highbury,1,1,0.797433320733662
i wish we could contrive it said she but i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in -- no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father,1,1,0.8889945569057461
do you know miss bates's niece that is i know you must have seen her a hundred times -- but are you acquainted,1,1,0.9291253439697813
these are the sights harriet to do one good how trifling they make every thing else appear -- i feel now as if i could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind,1,1,0.7274148839882412
ah harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts well smiling i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that is truly important if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves,1,1,0.8008338546900258
to fall in with each other on such an errand as this thought emma to meet in a charitable scheme this will bring a great increase of love on each side i should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration it must if i were not here i wish i were anywhere else,1,1,0.7706219056667766
this would soon have led to something better of course was her consoling reflection any thing interests between those who love and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart if i could but have kept longer away,1,1,0.8009118594867898
oh yes sir cried she with ready sympathy how you must miss her and dear emma too -- what a dreadful loss to you both -- i have been so grieved for you -- i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her -- it is a sad change indeed -- but i hope she is pretty well sir,1,1,0.980887085354233
pretty well my dear -- i hope -- pretty well -- i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably,1,1,0.865792099979022
mr woodhouse hesitated -- not near so often my dear as i could wish,1,1,0.9551929858768726
i think indeed said john knightley pleasantly that mr weston has some little claim you and i emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can,1,1,0.985435157541841
he has not been here yet replied emma there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately,1,1,0.9470460818697217
three-and-twenty -- is he indeed -- well i could not have thought it -- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother well time does fly indeed -- and my memory is very bad however it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston a great deal of pleasure i remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept 28th -- and began my dear madam ' but i forget how it went on and it was signed f c weston churchill ' -- i remember that perfectly,1,1,0.9626410430222789
nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy observed mr john knightley coolly but you need not imagine mr weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john mr weston is rather an easy cheerful-tempered man than a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any thing that home affords,1,1,0.9781854340745222
that's true she cried -- very true little emma grow up a better woman than your aunt be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited now mr knightley a word or two more and i have done as far as good intentions went we were both right and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong i only want to know that mr martin is not very very bitterly disappointed,1,1,0.9209985016852481
a man cannot be more so was his short full answer,1,0,0.46695005056388883
while they were thus comfortably occupied mr woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter,1,1,0.8941833479999771
and mrs perry and the children how are they do the children grow i have a great regard for mr perry i hope he will be calling soon he will be so pleased to see my little ones,1,1,0.930198806666394
you seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates said emma i have not heard one inquiry after them,1,1,0.9742673264775003
why pretty well my dear upon the whole but poor mrs bates had a bad cold about a month ago,1,1,0.8960139990294894
no indeed -- we are not at all in a bad air our part of london is very superior to most others -- you must not confound us with london in general my dear sir the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest we are so very airy i should be unwilling i own to live in any other part of the town -- there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in but we are so remarkably airy -- mr wingfield thinks the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air,1,1,0.9022227260113903
emma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in mrs goddard's unavoidable absences and raise her spirits by representing how much mr elton's would be depressed when he knew her state and left her at last tolerably comfortable in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit and of their all missing her very much she had not advanced many yards from mrs goddard's door when she was met by mr elton himself evidently coming towards it and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid -- of whom he on the rumour of considerable illness had been going to inquire that he might carry some report of her to hartfield -- they were overtaken by mr john knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell with his two eldest boys whose healthy glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for they joined company and proceeded together emma was just describing the nature of her friend's complaint -- a throat very much inflamed with a great deal of heat about her a quick low pulse c and she was sorry to find from mrs goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats and had often alarmed her with them mr elton looked all alarm on the occasion as he exclaimed,1,1,0.9983736136874499
a sore-throat -- i hope not infectious i hope not of a putrid infectious sort has perry seen her indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend let me entreat you to run no risks why does not perry see her,1,1,0.7891131233397115
it is so cold so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party i should really try not to go out to-day -- and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr and mrs weston but upon my word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself you appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night,1,1,0.8978401772017974
but hardly had she so spoken when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage if the weather were mr elton's only objection and mr elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction it was a done thing mr elton was to go and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment never had his smile been stronger nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her,1,1,0.9781354832109876
soon afterwards mr elton quitted them and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming harriet at parting in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs goddard's for news of her fair friend the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again when he hoped to be able to give a better report and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour,1,1,0.9922533231174422
me she replied with a smile of astonishment are you imagining me to be mr elton's object,1,1,0.8555683716416778
a man said he must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter such a day as this for the sake of coming to see him he must think himself a most agreeable fellow i could not do such a thing it is the greatest absurdity -- actually snowing at this moment -- the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people's not staying comfortably at home when they can if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this by any call of duty or business what a hardship we should deem it -- and here are we probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of the voice of nature which tells man in every thing given to his view or his feelings to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he can -- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man's house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again to-morrow going in dismal weather to return probably in worse -- four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home,1,1,0.9475348581776579
emma smiled and answered -- my visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint i hope but not even i can charm away a sore throat it is a most severe cold indeed mr perry has been with her as you probably heard,1,1,0.9491774356270294
we are sure of excellent fires continued he and every thing in the greatest comfort charming people mr and mrs weston -- mrs weston indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly what one values so hospitable and so fond of society -- it will be a small party but where small parties are select they are perhaps the most agreeable of any mr weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably and for my part i would rather under such circumstances fall short by two than exceed by two i think you will agree with me turning with a soft air to emma i think i shall certainly have your approbation though mr knightley perhaps from being used to the large parties of london may not quite enter into our feelings,1,1,0.9939958048418399
i know nothing of the large parties of london sir -- i never dine with any body,1,1,0.8247961476402109
my first enjoyment replied john knightley as they passed through the sweep-gate will be to find myself safe at hartfield again,1,1,0.906827922433038
emma's project of forgetting mr elton for a while made her rather sorry to find when they had all taken their places that he was close to her the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards harriet from her mind while he not only sat at her elbow but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion instead of forgetting him his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of can it really be as my brother imagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me -- absurd and insufferable -- yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm would be so interested about her father and so delighted with mrs weston and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners for her own sake she could not be rude and for harriet's in the hope that all would yet turn out right she was even positively civil but it was an effort especially as something was going on amongst the others in the most overpowering period of mr elton's nonsense which she particularly wished to listen to she heard enough to know that mr weston was giving some information about his son she heard the words my son and frank and my son repeated several times over and from a few other half-syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son but before she could quiet mr elton the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward,1,1,0.9977400228566334
he has been wanting to come to us continued mr weston ever since september every letter has been full of it but he cannot command his own time he has those to please who must be pleased and who between ourselves are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january,1,1,0.9521727212336193
what a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself,1,1,0.9820997988892036
i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case replied emma but am disposed to side with you mr weston if you think he will come i shall think so too for you know enscombe,1,1,0.9603639450706021
but she is so fond of the nephew he is so very great a favourite now according to my idea of mrs churchill it would be most natural that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards him she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes nothing at all,1,1,0.9236015457047929
emma listened and then coolly said i shall not be satisfied unless he comes,1,1,0.687543869308226
emma saw mrs weston's surprize and felt that it must be great at an address which in words and manner was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her and as for herself she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose she could only give him a look but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses and then left the sofa removing to a seat by her sister and giving her all her attention,1,1,0.9893684492283559
she had not time to know how mr elton took the reproof so rapidly did another subject succeed for mr john knightley now came into the room from examining the weather and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow and of its still snowing fast with a strong drifting wind concluding with these words to mr woodhouse,1,1,0.9028873872078255
what is to be done my dear emma -- what is to be done was mr woodhouse's first exclamation and all that he could say for some time to her he looked for comfort and her assurances of safety her representation of the excellence of the horses and of james and of their having so many friends about them revived him a little,1,1,0.9468824093100278
to isabella the relief of such tidings was very great and they were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her father's account who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at randalls he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay and while the others were variously urging and recommending mr knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences thus --,1,1,0.9955196397813295
isabella stept in after her father john knightley forgetting that he did not belong to their party stept in after his wife very naturally so that emma found on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by mr elton that the door was to be lawfully shut on them and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive it would not have been the awkwardness of a moment it would have been rather a pleasure previous to the suspicions of this very day she could have talked to him of harriet and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but one but now she would rather it had not happened she believed he had been drinking too much of mr weston's good wine and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense,1,1,0.9899625550330589
to restrain him as much as might be by her own manners she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night but scarcely had she begun scarcely had they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage than she found her subject cut up -- her hand seized -- her attention demanded and mr elton actually making violent love to her availing himself of the precious opportunity declaring sentiments which must be already well known hoping -- fearing -- adoring -- ready to die if she refused him but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect and in short very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible it really was so without scruple -- without apology -- without much apparent diffidence mr elton the lover of harriet was professing himself her lover she tried to stop him but vainly he would go on and say it all angry as she was the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak she felt that half this folly must be drunkenness and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour accordingly with a mixture of the serious and the playful which she hoped would best suit his half and half state she replied,1,1,0.9917689796768978
good heaven cried mr elton what can be the meaning of this -- miss smith -- i never thought of miss smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions but as your friend never cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend if she has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her and i am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- but miss smith indeed -- oh miss woodhouse who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse is near no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character i have thought only of you i protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else every thing that i have said or done for many weeks past has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself you cannot really seriously doubt it no -- in an accent meant to be insinuating -- i am sure you have seen and understood me,1,1,0.9954631341894653
if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man i could have borne any thing he might have doubled his presumption to me -- but poor harriet,1,1,0.9429007154791901
certainly she had often especially of late thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant but it had passed as his way as a mere error of judgment of knowledge of taste as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society that with all the gentleness of his address true elegance was sometimes wanting but till this very day she had never for an instant suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as harriet's friend,1,1,0.9811600388927443
emma was most agreeably surprized -- mr elton's absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired she admired him for contriving it though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father from which she was so pointedly excluded she had not even a share in his opening compliments -- her name was not mentioned -- and there was so striking a change in all this and such an ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments as she thought at first could not escape her father's suspicion,1,1,0.9963296029255522
harriet bore the intelligence very well -- blaming nobody -- and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend,1,1,0.9673632450055992
her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emma's eyes -- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do,1,1,0.9796111828036087
their being fixed so absolutely fixed in the same place was bad for each for all three not one of them had the power of removal or of effecting any material change of society they must encounter each other and make the best of it,1,1,0.7507445592331955
it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount he cannot want money -- he cannot want leisure we know on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom we hear of him for ever at some watering-place or other a little while ago he was at weymouth this proves that he can leave the churchills,1,1,0.7071437108546436
there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution it is frank churchill's duty to pay this attention to his father he knows it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done a man who felt rightly would say at once simply and resolutely to mrs churchill -- every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion i shall therefore set off to-morrow ' -- if he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no opposition made to his going,1,1,0.9588590307920994
i rather doubt that you are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones i can imagine that if you as you are mr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr frank churchill's situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect the churchills might not have a word to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through to him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought he may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it,1,1,0.9249029143531848
our amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others it ought to have been a habit with him by this time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency i can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man as he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father had he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now,1,1,0.8488012539061791
we shall never agree about him cried emma but that is nothing extraordinary i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man i feel sure that he is not mr weston would not be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely to have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's perfection i dare say he has and though it may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others,1,1,0.9475138859384455
yes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father's having any right to complain his letters disgust me,1,1,0.8109143404759052
well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure at highbury we do not often look upon fine young men well-bred and agreeable we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain cannot you imagine mr knightley what a sensation his coming will produce there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest -- one object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else,1,1,0.9792174738553183
but i am very much and without being at all ashamed of it my love for mr and mrs weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour,1,1,0.9714497922280131
he is a person i never think of from one month's end to another said mr knightley with a degree of vexation which made emma immediately talk of something else though she could not comprehend why he should be angry,1,1,0.9739167032516635
to take a dislike to a young man only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him for with all the high opinion of himself which she had often laid to his charge she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another,1,1,0.9326115501816704
emma and harriet had been walking together one morning and in emma's opinion had been talking enough of mr elton for that day she could not think that harriet's solace or her own sins required more and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned -- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- mr elton is so good to the poor she found something else must be done,1,1,0.9956371880873444
oh yes -- mr elton i understand -- certainly as to dancing -- mrs cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was -- mrs cole was so kind as to sit some time with us talking of jane for as soon as she came in she began inquiring after her jane is so very great a favourite there whenever she is with us mrs cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can and so she began inquiring after her directly saying i know you cannot have heard from jane lately because it is not her time for writing ' and when i immediately said but indeed we have we had a letter this very morning ' i do not know that i ever saw any body more surprized have you upon your honour ' said she well that is quite unexpected do let me hear what she says ',1,1,0.996889412503776
and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it she was pondering in the meanwhile upon the possibility without seeming very rude of making her escape from jane fairfax's letter and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse when miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention,1,1,0.9905019268181192
so obliging of you no we should not have heard if it had not been for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon my mother is so delighted -- for she is to be three months with us at least three months she says so positively as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you the case is you see that the campbells are going to ireland mrs dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly they had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married last october she was never away from them so much as a week which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say but however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father i declare i do not know which it was but we shall see presently in jane's letter -- wrote in mr dixon's name as well as her own to press their coming over directly and they would give them the meeting in dublin and take them back to their country seat baly-craig a beautiful place i fancy jane has heard a great deal of its beauty from mr dixon i mean -- i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else but it was very natural you know that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for colonel and mrs campbell were very particular about their daughter's not walking out often with only mr dixon for which i do not at all blame them of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he had taken himself he is a most amiable charming young man i believe jane was quite longing to go to ireland from his account of things,1,1,0.997099389607013
you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs dixon you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs campbell,1,1,0.9963657490198146
i am concerned to hear of it i think they judge wisely but mrs dixon must be very much disappointed mrs dixon i understand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not by any means to be compared with miss fairfax,1,1,0.98589059479509
jane caught a bad cold poor thing so long ago as the 7th of november as i am going to read to you and has never been well since a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her she never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us just like her so considerate -- but however she is so far from well that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home and try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her -- and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is unwell nobody could nurse her as we should do,1,1,0.9775278859448283
and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following -- as you will find from jane's letter so sudden -- you may guess dear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in if it was not for the drawback of her illness -- but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that i always make a point of reading jane's letters through to myself first before i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her jane desired me to do it so i always do and so i began to-day with my usual caution but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i burst out quite frightened with bless me poor jane is ill ' -- which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at however when i read on i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her that she does not think much about it but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard if jane does not get well soon we will call in mr perry the expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know he has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time well now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her,1,1,0.9938139886382551
the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbell's power for though his income by pay and appointments was handsome his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter's but by giving her an education he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter,1,1,0.9793766636775386
such was jane fairfax's history she had fallen into good hands known nothing but kindness from the campbells and been given an excellent education living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture and colonel campbell's residence being in london every lighter talent had been done full justice to by the attendance of first-rate masters her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do and at eighteen or nineteen she was as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children fully competent to the office of instruction herself but she was too much beloved to be parted with neither father nor mother could promote and the daughter could not endure it the evil day was put off it was easy to decide that she was still too young and jane remained with them sharing as another daughter in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society and a judicious mixture of home and amusement with only the drawback of the future the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over,1,1,0.9937471512840071
emma was sorry -- to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months -- to be always doing more than she wished and less than she ought why she did not like jane fairfax might be a difficult question to answer mr knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman which she wanted to be thought herself and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time there were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her but she could never get acquainted with her she did not know how it was but there was such coldness and reserve -- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then her aunt was such an eternal talker -- and she was made such a fuss with by every body -- and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other these were her reasons -- she had no better,1,1,0.9943639709659213
it was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any considerable absence without feeling that she had injured her and now when the due visit was paid on her arrival after a two years' interval she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating jane fairfax was very elegant remarkably elegant and she had herself the highest value for elegance her height was pretty just such as almost every body would think tall and nobody could think very tall her figure particularly graceful her size a most becoming medium between fat and thin though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two emma could not but feel all this and then her face -- her features -- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered it was not regular but it was very pleasing beauty her eyes a deep grey with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows had never been denied their praise but the skin which she had been used to cavil at as wanting colour had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom it was a style of beauty of which elegance was the reigning character and as such she must in honour by all her principles admire it -- elegance which whether of person or of mind she saw so little in highbury there not to be vulgar was distinction and merit,1,1,0.9936568043768356
these were charming feelings -- but not lasting before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for jane fairfax or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors than saying to mr knightley she certainly is handsome she is better than handsome jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state former provocations reappeared the aunt was as tiresome as ever more tiresome because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast and how small a slice of mutton for dinner as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself and jane's offences rose again they had music emma was obliged to play and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour an air of greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance she was besides which was the worst of all so cold so cautious there was no getting at her real opinion wrapt up in a cloak of politeness she seemed determined to hazard nothing she was disgustingly was suspiciously reserved,1,1,0.9950281778582017
the like reserve prevailed on other topics she and mr frank churchill had been at weymouth at the same time it was known that they were a little acquainted but not a syllable of real information could emma procure as to what he truly was was he handsome -- she believed he was reckoned a very fine young man was he agreeable -- he was generally thought so did he appear a sensible young man a young man of information -- at a watering-place or in a common london acquaintance it was difficult to decide on such points manners were all that could be safely judged of under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of mr churchill she believed every body found his manners pleasing emma could not forgive her,1,1,0.9974193270822379
i am happy you approved said emma smiling but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield,1,1,0.9484581325563957
my dear emma said he moving from his chair into one close by her you are not going to tell me i hope that you had not a pleasant evening,1,1,0.7417457623581579
my dear papa i sent the whole hind-quarter i knew you would wish it there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like,1,1,0.8670727109452846
emma had not had time even to think of mr elton and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start and a little blush at the sound,1,1,0.9713259523671416
there is my news -- i thought it would interest you said mr knightley with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them,1,1,0.9270242411023744
well that is quite -- i suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting my dear sir you really are too bountiful my mother desires her very best compliments and regards and a thousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her,1,1,0.809485352063915
oh my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good to us if ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us we may well say that our lot is cast in a goodly heritage ' well mr knightley and so you actually saw the letter well --,1,1,0.8224622709108724
quite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all,1,1,0.7535237451903151
the shower was heavy but short and it had not been over five minutes when in came harriet with just the heated agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give and the oh miss woodhouse what do you think has happened which instantly burst forth had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation as the blow was given emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening and harriet unchecked ran eagerly through what she had to tell she had set out from mrs goddard's half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible but then as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her she thought she would just step in and see how it went on and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain and she did not know what to do so she ran on directly as fast as she could and took shelter at ford's -- ford's was the principal woollen-draper linen-draper and haberdasher's shop united the shop first in size and fashion in the place -- and so there she had set without an idea of any thing in the world full ten minutes perhaps -- when all of a sudden who should come in -- to be sure it was so very odd -- but they always dealt at ford's -- who should come in but elizabeth martin and her brother -- dear miss woodhouse only think i thought i should have fainted i did not know what to do i was sitting near the door -- elizabeth saw me directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella i am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took no notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop and i kept sitting near the door -- oh dear i was so miserable i am sure i must have been as white as my gown i could not go away you know because of the rain but i did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there -- oh dear miss woodhouse -- well at last i fancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going on with her buyings they began whispering to one another i am sure they were talking of me and i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me -- do you think he was miss woodhouse -- for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands if i would she did not do any of it in the same way that she used i could see she was altered but however she seemed to try to be very friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time but i know no more what i said -- i was in such a tremble -- i remember she said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost too kind dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable by that time it was beginning to hold up and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think -- i found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know and as if he did not quite know what to do and so he came and spoke and i answered -- and i stood for a minute feeling dreadfully you know one can't tell how and then i took courage and said it did not rain and i must go and so off i set and i had not got three yards from the door when he came after me only to say if i was going to hartfield he thought i had much better go round by mr cole's stables for i should find the near way quite floated by this rain oh dear i thought it would have been the death of me so i said i was very much obliged to him you know i could not do less and then he went back to elizabeth and i came round by the stables -- i believe i did -- but i hardly knew where i was or any thing about it oh miss woodhouse i would rather done any thing than have it happen and yet you know there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly and elizabeth too oh miss woodhouse do talk to me and make me comfortable again,1,1,0.9821888469627839
she exerted herself and did try to make her comfortable by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle and quite unworthy of being dwelt on,1,1,0.8667373170252152
it might be distressing for the moment said she but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is over -- and may never -- can never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it,1,1,0.9052846248444257
harriet said very true and she would not think about it but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else and emma at last in order to put the martins out of her head was obliged to hurry on the news which she had meant to give with so much tender caution hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry ashamed or only amused at such a state of mind in poor harriet -- such a conclusion of mr elton's importance with her,1,1,0.99414471323813
he had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection and was just the happy man he ought to be talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and with cordial fearless smiles now addressing all the young ladies of the place to whom a few weeks ago he would have been more cautiously gallant,1,1,0.9225976913558012
the wedding was no distant event as the parties had only themselves to please and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for and when he set out for bath again there was a general expectation which a certain glance of mrs cole's did not seem to contradict that when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride,1,1,0.9587301049912306
could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all she had talked her into love but alas she was not so easily to be talked out of it the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriet's mind was not to be talked away he might be superseded by another he certainly would indeed nothing could be clearer even a robert martin would have been sufficient but nothing else she feared would cure her harriet was one of those who having once begun would be always in love and now poor girl she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr elton she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other emma saw him only once but two or three times every day harriet was sure just to meet with him or just to miss him just to hear his voice or see his shoulder just to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture she was moreover perpetually hearing about him for excepting when at hartfield she was always among those who saw no fault in mr elton and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns and every report therefore every guess -- all that had already occurred all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs comprehending income servants and furniture was continually in agitation around her her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him and her regrets kept alive and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkins's happiness and continual observation of how much he seemed attached -- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat being all in proof of how much he was in love,1,1,0.9977529968642014
small heart had harriet for visiting only half an hour before her friend called for her at mrs goddard's her evil stars had led her to the very spot where at that moment a trunk directed to the rev philip elton white-hart bath was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher's cart which was to convey it to where the coaches past and every thing in this world excepting that trunk and the direction was consequently a blank,1,1,0.7805328318609354
mr weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command as well as the route and the method of his journey and she listened and smiled and congratulated,1,1,0.9206898145718581
think of me to-morrow my dear emma about four o'clock was mrs weston's parting injunction spoken with some anxiety and meant only for her,1,1,0.96919807815053
but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time,1,1,0.7486979681300463
i hope i should know better he replied no depend upon it with a gallant bow that in addressing mrs weston i should understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms,1,1,0.9652840689621763
as you are going farther on business sir i will take the opportunity of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other and therefore may as well be paid now i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours turning to emma a lady residing in or near highbury a family of the name of fairfax i shall have no difficulty i suppose in finding the house though fairfax i believe is not the proper name -- i should rather say barnes or bates do you know any family of that name,1,1,0.986635332269229
their first pause was at the crown inn an inconsiderable house though the principal one of the sort where a couple of pair of post-horses were kept more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added it had been built many years ago for a ball-room and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous dancing state had been occasionally used as such -- but such brilliant days had long passed away and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place he was immediately interested its character as a ball-room caught him and instead of passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open to look in and contemplate its capabilities and lament that its original purpose should have ceased he saw no fault in the room he would acknowledge none which they suggested no it was long enough broad enough handsome enough it would hold the very number for comfort they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room -- she who could do any thing in highbury the want of proper families in the place and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend were mentioned but he was not satisfied he could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting and even when particulars were given and families described he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their proper place the next morning he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing and emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the churchills he seemed to have all the life and spirit cheerful feelings and social inclinations of his father and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe of pride indeed there was perhaps scarcely enough his indifference to a confusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of mind he could be no judge however of the evil he was holding cheap it was but an effusion of lively spirits,1,1,0.9917045204082413
they went in and while the sleek well-tied parcels of men's beavers and york tan were bringing down and displaying on the counter he said -- but i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae do not let me lose it i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life,1,1,0.7457996073181514
may i indeed -- then i will speak the truth and nothing suits me so well i met her frequently at weymouth i had known the campbells a little in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set colonel campbell is a very agreeable man and mrs campbell a friendly warm-hearted woman i like them all,1,1,0.9763476628175872
you get upon delicate subjects emma said mrs weston smiling remember that i am here -- mr frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax's situation in life i will move a little farther off,1,1,0.9932027813817544
he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment,1,1,0.6785970948504755
ever hear her repeated emma you forget how much she belongs to highbury i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began she plays charmingly,1,1,0.8802203889615327
there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all -- he began rather quickly but checking himself added however it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were -- how it might all be behind the scenes i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly but you who have known miss fairfax from a child must be a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations than i can be,1,1,0.9677576134535865
i am not fond of dinner-visiting said he -- i never was no more is emma late hours do not agree with us i am sorry mr and mrs cole should have done it i think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk which they might do as our hours are so reasonable and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any body to however as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them and as you will both be there and mr knightley too to take care of her i cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought neither damp nor cold nor windy then turning to mrs weston with a look of gentle reproach -- ah miss taylor if you had not married you would have staid at home with me,1,1,0.9903803868681148
but the idea of any thing to be done in a moment was increasing not lessening mr woodhouse's agitation the ladies knew better how to allay it mr weston must be quiet and every thing deliberately arranged,1,1,0.9753493980791119
you will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible you will say that i am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must decline their obliging invitation beginning with my compliments of course but you will do every thing right i need not tell you what is to be done we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be wanted on tuesday i shall have no fears for you with him we have never been there above once since the new approach was made but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely and when you get there you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again and you had better name an early hour you will not like staying late you will get very tired when tea is over,1,1,0.8367471068167892
he did on the condition of some promises on her side such as that if she came home cold she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly if hungry that she would take something to eat that her own maid should sit up for her and that serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house as usual,1,1,0.8585568313708489
with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again and for a longer time than hitherto of judging of his general manners and by inference of the meaning of his manners towards herself of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air and of fancying what the observations of all those might be who were now seeing them together for the first time,1,1,0.959503843841695
he thanked her observing how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment for if we had met first in the drawing-room i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual -- you might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner,1,1,0.8918268901129723
mrs cole had many to agree with her every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made and there were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way and still listen to mrs cole,1,1,0.9928223469901436
miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs cole's turned to frank churchill,1,1,0.9907250736349575
you may say what you chuse -- but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine,1,1,0.675083583011705
and upon my word they have an air of great probability mr dixon's preference of her music to her friend's i can answer for being very decided,1,1,0.9226658145513194
the conversation was here interrupted they were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others but when the table was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed exactly right and occupation and ease were generally restored emma said,1,1,0.8340637533131792
in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte she felt too much in the secret herself to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair and therefore purposely kept at a distance but by the others the subject was almost immediately introduced and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of my excellent friend colonel campbell,1,1,0.9899357565672298
they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen and the very first of the early was frank churchill in he walked the first and the handsomest and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and her niece made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle where sat miss woodhouse and till he could find a seat by her would not sit at all emma divined what every body present must be thinking she was his object and every body must perceive it she introduced him to her friend miss smith and at convenient moments afterwards heard what each thought of the other he had never seen so lovely a face and was delighted with her naivete and she only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment but she did think there were some looks a little like mr elton emma restrained her indignation and only turned from her in silence,1,1,0.9972791301704914
i have made a most wretched discovery said he after a short pause -- i have been here a week to-morrow -- half my time i never knew days fly so fast a week to-morrow -- and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself but just got acquainted with mrs weston and others -- i hate the recollection,1,1,0.9200409215926227
the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes and listen to mr cole when mr cole had moved away and her attention could be restored as before she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room at miss fairfax who was sitting exactly opposite,1,1,0.9878584274862152
oh yes -- but how they were conveyed hither -- the manner of their coming,1,1,0.6307698696850748
they walked i conclude how else could they come,1,1,0.5464550421858732
nay she has always been a first favourite with him as you very well know,1,1,0.8077421417902654
i see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than what you mention his good-nature his humanity as i tell you would be quite enough to account for the horses he has a great regard for the bateses you know independent of jane fairfax -- and is always glad to shew them attention my dear mrs weston do not take to match-making you do it very ill jane fairfax mistress of the abbey -- oh no no -- every feeling revolts for his own sake i would not have him do so mad a thing,1,1,0.9923139149148166
nonsense he does not care about jane fairfax in the way of love i am sure he does not he would do any good to her or her family but --,1,1,0.9470709716999612
i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common course of things occur to him,1,1,0.9073749082665157
very well and if he had intended to give her one he would have told her so,1,1,0.900167315910913
there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma i have a very strong notion that it comes from him i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs cole told us of it at dinner,1,1,0.9703599837686117
with mixed feelings she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument to listen frank churchill sang again they had sung together once or twice it appeared at weymouth but the sight of mr knightley among the most attentive soon drew away half emma's mind and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of mrs weston's suspicions to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions her objections to mr knightley's marrying did not in the least subside she could see nothing but evil in it it would be a great disappointment to mr john knightley consequently to isabella a real injury to the children -- a most mortifying change and material loss to them all -- a very great deduction from her father's daily comfort -- and as to herself she could not at all endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey a mrs knightley for them all to give way to -- no -- mr knightley must never marry little henry must remain the heir of donwell,1,1,0.999318069677334
yes he replied and without the smallest apparent embarrassment -- but they would have done better had they given her notice of it surprizes are foolish things the pleasure is not enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell,1,1,0.9607598213926023
that fellow said he indignantly thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice this must not be and touching miss bates who at that moment passed near -- miss bates are you mad to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner go and interfere they have no mercy on her,1,1,0.7456460213883968
miss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even to be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing here ceased the concert part of the evening for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers but soon within five minutes the proposal of dancing -- originating nobody exactly knew where -- was so effectually promoted by mr and mrs cole that every thing was rapidly clearing away to give proper space mrs weston capital in her country-dances was seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and frank churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma had secured her hand and led her up to the top,1,1,0.9977989816944478
two dances unfortunately were all that could be allowed it was growing late and miss bates became anxious to get home on her mother's account after some attempts therefore to be permitted to begin again they were obliged to thank mrs weston look sorrowful and have done,1,1,0.9809155708135724
she was then interrupted by harriet's coming in and if harriet's praise could have satisfied her she might soon have been comforted,1,1,0.971459076991311
she looked down the randalls road the scene enlarged two persons appeared mrs weston and her son-in-law they were walking into highbury -- to hartfield of course they were stopping however in the first place at mrs bates's whose house was a little nearer randalls than ford's and had all but knocked when emma caught their eye -- immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her and the agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting mrs weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses in order to hear the new instrument,1,1,0.9892233948774625
for my companion tells me said she that i absolutely promised miss bates last night that i would come this morning i was not aware of it myself i did not know that i had fixed a day but as he says i did i am going now,1,1,0.880463384643203
me i should be quite in the way but perhaps -- i may be equally in the way here miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping she says i fidget her to death and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same what am i to do,1,1,0.9127022449065532
i am here on no business of my own said emma i am only waiting for my friend she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home but you had better go with mrs weston and hear the instrument,1,1,0.9407935181113672
well -- if you advise it -- but with a smile if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall i say i shall be no support to mrs weston she might do very well by herself a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood,1,1,0.9647446182272783
i do not believe any such thing replied emma -- i am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent quite otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfax's opinion last night,1,1,0.9791405728181052
that you do not give another half-second to the subject to hartfield if you please mrs ford,1,1,0.917200672905685
voices approached the shop -- or rather one voice and two ladies mrs weston and miss bates met them at the door,1,1,0.9021487363009939
very well i am much obliged to you my mother is delightfully well and jane caught no cold last night how is mr woodhouse -- i am so glad to hear such a good account mrs weston told me you were here -- oh then said i i must run across i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party she cannot refuse -- aye pray do ' said mr frank churchill miss woodhouse's opinion of the instrument will be worth having ' -- but said i i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me -- oh ' said he wait half a minute till i have finished my job ' -- for would you believe it miss woodhouse there he is in the most obliging manner in the world fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles -- the rivet came out you know this morning -- so very obliging -- for my mother had no use of her spectacles -- could not put them on and by the bye every body ought to have two pair of spectacles they should indeed jane said so i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did but something or other hindered me all the morning first one thing then another there is no saying what you know at one time patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping oh said i patty do not come with your bad news to me here is the rivet of your mistress's spectacles out then the baked apples came home mrs wallis sent them by her boy they are extremely civil and obliging to us the wallises always -- i have heard some people say that mrs wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them and it cannot be for the value of our custom now for what is our consumption of bread you know only three of us -- besides dear jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast you would be quite frightened if you saw it i dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so i say one thing and then i say another and it passes off but about the middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr perry i happened to meet him in the street not that i had any doubt before -- i have so often heard mr woodhouse recommend a baked apple i believe it is the only way that mr woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome we have apple-dumplings however very often patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling well mrs weston you have prevailed i hope and these ladies will oblige us,1,1,0.9920570122283153
emma would be very happy to wait on mrs bates c and they did at last move out of the shop with no farther delay from miss bates than,1,1,0.9818889709952061
emma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix,1,1,0.8898471695436595
the appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered was tranquillity itself mrs bates deprived of her usual employment slumbering on one side of the fire frank churchill at a table near her most deedily occupied about her spectacles and jane fairfax standing with her back to them intent on her pianoforte,1,1,0.9764539338528097
i have not been working uninterruptedly he replied i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor i believe you see we have been wedging one leg with paper this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home,1,1,0.8018470226903298
jane did not look round she was not obliged to hear mrs weston had been speaking to her at the same moment,1,1,0.9872958017341249
shortly afterwards miss bates passing near the window descried mr knightley on horse-back not far off,1,1,0.8557356871795382
mr knightley i declare -- i must speak to him if possible just to thank him i will not open the window here it would give you all cold but i can go into my mother's room you know i dare say he will come in when he knows who is here quite delightful to have you all meet so -- our little room so honoured,1,1,0.8787748707582395
so obliged to you -- so very much obliged to you for the carriage resumed miss bates,1,1,0.9605525000578795
i am going to kingston can i do any thing for you,1,1,0.7247179296469736
mrs cole has servants to send can i do any thing for you,1,1,0.861261112353223
well said he in a deliberating manner for five minutes perhaps,1,1,0.6739867552725979
oh very delightful indeed i can say nothing less for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes and raising his voice still more i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too i think miss fairfax dances very well and mrs weston is the very best country-dance player without exception in england now if your friends have any gratitude they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return but i cannot stay to hear it,1,1,0.9933414191991972
his first proposition and request that the dance begun at mr cole's should be finished there -- that the same party should be collected and the same musician engaged met with the readiest acquiescence mr weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment and mrs weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance and the interesting employment had followed of reckoning up exactly who there would be and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple,1,1,0.965881404233294
we were too magnificent said he we allowed unnecessary room ten couple may stand here very well,1,1,0.6265658063166335
emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self-willed and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her but she took the compliment and forgave the rest had she intended ever to marry him it might have been worth while to pause and consider and try to understand the value of his preference and the character of his temper but for all the purposes of their acquaintance he was quite amiable enough,1,1,0.9739182096711245
open the windows -- but surely mr churchill nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls nobody could be so imprudent i never heard of such a thing dancing with open windows -- i am sure neither your father nor mrs weston poor miss taylor that was would suffer it,1,1,0.9621960901240385
ah sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window-curtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected i have often known it done myself,1,1,0.5324750252591798
one perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain it regarded a supper-room at the time of the ballroom's being built suppers had not been in question and a small card-room adjoining was the only addition what was to be done this card-room would be wanted as a card-room now or if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves still was it not too small for any comfortable supper another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose but it was at the other end of the house and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it this made a difficulty mrs weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage and neither emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper,1,1,0.9131894586412305
well -- if you please said mrs weston rather hesitating if you think she will be of any use,1,1,0.9019911748027523
alas there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr knightley two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of every thing a letter arrived from mr churchill to urge his nephew's instant return mrs churchill was unwell -- far too unwell to do without him she had been in a very suffering state so said her husband when writing to her nephew two days before though from her usual unwillingness to give pain and constant habit of never thinking of herself she had not mentioned it but now she was too ill to trifle and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay,1,1,0.9955082284040186
her father's feelings were quite distinct he thought principally of mrs churchill's illness and wanted to know how she was treated and as for the ball it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed but they would all be safer at home,1,1,0.9890515216570454
such a fortnight as it has been he continued every day more precious and more delightful than the day before -- every day making me less fit to bear any other place happy those who can remain at highbury,1,1,0.8994177079364271
as you do us such ample justice now said emma laughing i will venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first do not we rather surpass your expectations i am sure we do i am sure you did not much expect to like us you would not have been so long in coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury,1,1,0.8587788862109772
not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates how unlucky miss bates's powerful argumentative mind might have strengthened yours,1,1,0.9801864284555032
he looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts she hardly knew what to say it seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious which she did not wish forcing herself to speak therefore in the hope of putting it by she calmly said,1,1,0.8967355515872605
it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield my regard for hartfield is most warm --,1,1,0.9352337944933207
a very few minutes more however completed the present trial mr weston always alert when business was to be done and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable as of foreseeing any that was doubtful said it was time to go and the young man though he might and did sigh could not but agree to take leave,1,1,0.9157646732064455
i shall hear about you all said he that is my chief consolation i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you i have engaged mrs weston to correspond with me she has been so kind as to promise it oh the blessing of a female correspondent when one is really interested in the absent -- she will tell me every thing in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again,1,1,0.9357366041181133
it was a sad change they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks -- indescribable spirit the idea the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought the assurance of his attentions his liveliness his manners it had been a very happy fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of hartfield days to complete every other recommendation he had almost told her that he loved her what strength or what constancy of affection he might be subject to was another point but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration a conscious preference of herself and this persuasion joined to all the rest made her think that she must be a little in love with him in spite of every previous determination against it,1,1,0.9946809610230418
i certainly must said she this sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house -- i must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not -- for a few weeks at least well evil to some is always good to others i shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball if not for frank churchill but mr knightley will be happy he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes,1,1,0.961524557470443
emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love her ideas only varied as to the how much at first she thought it was a good deal and afterwards but little she had great pleasure in hearing frank churchill talked of and for his sake greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr and mrs weston she was very often thinking of him and quite impatient for a letter that she might know how he was how were his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance of his coming to randalls again this spring but on the other hand she could not admit herself to be unhappy nor after the first morning to be less disposed for employment than usual she was still busy and cheerful and pleasing as he was she could yet imagine him to have faults and farther though thinking of him so much and as she sat drawing or working forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment fancying interesting dialogues and inventing elegant letters the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she refused him their affection was always to subside into friendship every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting but still they were to part when she became sensible of this it struck her that she could not be very much in love for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father never to marry a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings,1,1,0.9985699404647992
he is undoubtedly very much in love -- every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed -- and when he comes again if his affection continue i must be on my guard not to encourage it -- it would be most inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto no if he had believed me at all to share his feelings he would not have been so wretched could he have thought himself encouraged his looks and language at parting would have been different -- still however i must be on my guard this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is but i do not know that i expect it will i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man -- i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy -- his feelings are warm but i can imagine them rather changeable -- every consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved -- i shall do very well again after a little while -- and then it will be a good thing over for they say every body is in love once in their lives and i shall have been let off easily,1,1,0.9720518756139442
when his letter to mrs weston arrived emma had the perusal of it and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she had undervalued their strength it was a long well-written letter giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings expressing all the affection gratitude and respect which was natural and honourable and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive with spirit and precision no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern it was the language of real feeling towards mrs weston and the transition from highbury to enscombe the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety -- the charm of her own name was not wanting miss woodhouse appeared more than once and never without a something of pleasing connexion either a compliment to her taste or a remembrance of what she had said and in the very last time of its meeting her eye unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words -- i had not a spare moment on tuesday as you know for miss woodhouse's beautiful little friend pray make my excuses and adieus to her this emma could not doubt was all for herself harriet was remembered only from being her friend his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated mrs churchill was recovering and he dared not yet even in his own imagination fix a time for coming to randalls again,1,1,0.9991390643715312
i must not dwell upon it said she -- i must not think of it i know the danger of indulging such speculations but stranger things have happened and when we cease to care for each other as we do now it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward to with pleasure,1,1,0.639428184529588
it was well to have a comfort in store on harriet's behalf though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom for evil in that quarter was at hand as frank churchill's arrival had succeeded mr elton's engagement in the conversation of highbury as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first so now upon frank churchill's disappearance mr elton's concerns were assuming the most irresistible form -- his wedding-day was named he would soon be among them again mr elton and his bride there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe before mr elton and his bride was in every body's mouth and frank churchill was forgotten emma grew sick at the sound she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr elton and harriet's mind she had been willing to hope had been lately gaining strength with mr weston's ball in view at least there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach -- new carriage bell-ringing and all,1,1,0.9978465347194636
emma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects and she made a point of harriet's going with her that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible,1,1,0.9825504183190721
she did not really like her she would not be in a hurry to find fault but she suspected that there was no elegance -- ease but not elegance -- she was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride there was too much ease her person was rather good her face not unpretty but neither feature nor air nor voice nor manner were elegant emma thought at least it would turn out so,1,1,0.9013390901087471
yes said harriet earnestly and well she might nobody could ever have a better well i wish them happy with all my heart and now miss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again he is just as superior as ever -- but being married you know it is quite a different thing no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery to know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort -- she does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves happy creature he called her augusta ' how delightful,1,1,0.9953808978117236
the very first subject after being seated was maple grove my brother mr suckling's seat -- a comparison of hartfield to maple grove the grounds of hartfield were small but neat and pretty and the house was modern and well-built mrs elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room the entrance and all that she could see or imagine very like maple grove indeed -- she was quite struck by the likeness -- that room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at maple grove her sister's favourite room -- mr elton was appealed to -- was not it astonishingly like -- she could really almost fancy herself at maple grove,1,1,0.9792184760011071
oh yes i am quite aware of that it is the garden of england you know surry is the garden of england,1,0,0.29655489545179325
no i fancy not replied mrs elton with a most satisfied smile i never heard any county but surry called so,1,1,0.9503758620551166
my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring or summer at farthest continued mrs elton and that will be our time for exploring while they are with us we shall explore a great deal i dare say they will have their barouche-landau of course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying any thing of our carriage we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well they would hardly come in their chaise i think at that season of the year indeed when the time draws on i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau it will be so very much preferable when people come into a beautiful country of this sort you know miss woodhouse one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible and mr suckling is extremely fond of exploring we explored to king's-weston twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their first having the barouche-landau you have many parties of that kind here i suppose miss woodhouse every summer,1,1,0.9837338048766777
ah there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort nobody can be more devoted to home than i am i was quite a proverb for it at maple grove many a time has selina said when she has been going to bristol i really cannot get this girl to move from the house i absolutely must go in by myself though i hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion but augusta i believe with her own good-will would never stir beyond the park paling ' many a time has she said so and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion i think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little i perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouse -- looking towards mr woodhouse your father's state of health must be a great drawback why does not he try bath -- indeed he should let me recommend bath to you i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr woodhouse good,1,1,0.9925705446891073
ah that's a great pity for i assure you miss woodhouse where the waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief they give in my bath life i have seen such instances of it and it is so cheerful a place that it could not fail of being of use to mr woodhouse's spirits which i understand are sometimes much depressed and as to its recommendations to you i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell on them the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally understood it would be a charming introduction for you who have lived so secluded a life and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance and my particular friend mrs partridge the lady i have always resided with when in bath would be most happy to shew you any attentions and would be the very person for you to go into public with,1,1,0.9827540770510186
oh no indeed i must protest against any such idea a superior performer -- very far from it i assure you consider from how partial a quarter your information came i am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond -- and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree you miss woodhouse i well know play delightfully i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me to hear what a musical society i am got into i absolutely cannot do without music it is a necessary of life to me and having always been used to a very musical society both at maple grove and in bath it would have been a most serious sacrifice i honestly said as much to mr e when he was speaking of my future home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable and the inferiority of the house too -- knowing what i had been accustomed to -- of course he was not wholly without apprehension when he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that the world i could give up -- parties balls plays -- for i had no fear of retirement blessed with so many resources within myself the world was not necessary to me i could do very well without it to those who had no resources it was a different thing but my resources made me quite independent and as to smaller-sized rooms than i had been used to i really could not give it a thought i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove but i did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness nor were spacious apartments but ' said i to be quite honest i do not think i can live without something of a musical society i condition for nothing else but without music life would be a blank to me ',1,1,0.9871322147364797
no indeed i have no doubts at all on that head i am delighted to find myself in such a circle i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together i think miss woodhouse you and i must establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours will not it be a good plan if we exert ourselves i think we shall not be long in want of allies something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me as an inducement to keep me in practice for married women you know -- there is a sad story against them in general they are but too apt to give up music,1,1,0.9143187438851228
but you who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger surely,1,1,0.6368963700869609
but every thing of that kind said emma will soon be in so regular a train --,1,1,0.7991198811920927
having understood as much i was rather astonished to find her so very lady-like but she is really quite the gentlewoman,1,1,0.803917512459838
happily it was now time to be gone they were off and emma could breathe,1,1,0.7932277865088121
insufferable woman was her immediate exclamation worse than i had supposed absolutely insufferable knightley -- i could not have believed it knightley -- never seen him in her life before and call him knightley -- and discover that he is a gentleman a little upstart vulgar being with her mr e and her caro sposo and her resources and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery actually to discover that mr knightley is a gentleman i doubt whether he will return the compliment and discover her to be a lady i could not have believed it and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club one would fancy we were bosom friends and mrs weston -- astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman worse and worse i never met with her equal much beyond my hopes harriet is disgraced by any comparison oh what would frank churchill say to her if he were here how angry and how diverted he would be ah there i am -- thinking of him directly always the first person to be thought of how i catch myself out frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind --,1,1,0.9946762336179801
yes but a young lady -- a bride -- i ought to have paid my respects to her if possible it was being very deficient,1,1,0.9256403582487941
i cannot think there is any danger of it was emma's calm answer -- and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax's situation and understand what her home has been with colonel and mrs campbell i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown,1,1,0.991786882177207
oh but dear miss woodhouse she is now in such retirement such obscurity so thrown away -- whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end and i think she feels it i am sure she does she is very timid and silent one can see that she feels the want of encouragement i like her the better for it i must confess it is a recommendation to me i am a great advocate for timidity -- and i am sure one does not often meet with it -- but in those who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing oh i assure you jane fairfax is a very delightful character and interests me more than i can express,1,1,0.9850905729252551
jane had come to highbury professedly for three months the campbells were gone to ireland for three months but now the campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there according to miss bates -- it all came from her -- mrs dixon had written most pressingly would jane but go means were to be found servants sent friends contrived -- no travelling difficulty allowed to exist but still she had declined it,1,1,0.9929644705606518
you are right mrs weston said mr knightley warmly miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her but with a reproachful smile at emma she receives attentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her,1,1,0.9982491071375363
emma felt that mrs weston was giving her a momentary glance and she was herself struck by his warmth with a faint blush she presently replied,1,1,0.9839540877809999
both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again and after a few minutes silence he said,1,1,0.6706344065313495
and yet said emma beginning hastily and with an arch look but soon stopping -- it was better however to know the worst at once -- she hurried on -- and yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other,1,1,0.8349476458550636
mr knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters and either the exertion of getting them together or some other cause brought the colour into his face as he answered,1,0,0.32320252507686764
that will never be however i can assure you miss fairfax i dare say would not have me if i were to ask her -- and i am very sure i shall never ask her,1,1,0.9672935207380984
you are not vain mr knightley i will say that for you,1,1,0.8770283630787714
in that respect how unlike dear mrs elton who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world i wonder how she speaks of the coles -- what she calls them how can she find any appellation for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity she calls you knightley -- what can she do for mr cole and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her mrs weston your argument weighs most with me i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax's mind over mrs elton i have no faith in mrs elton's acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau,1,1,0.9968772849118438
jane fairfax has feeling said mr knightley -- i do not accuse her of want of feeling her sensibilities i suspect are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience self-controul but it wants openness she is reserved more reserved i think than she used to be -- and i love an open temper no -- till cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond,1,1,0.9940714860931819
i see how it is said she i see what a life i am to lead among you upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated we really seem quite the fashion if this is living in the country it is nothing very formidable from monday next to saturday i assure you we have not a disengaged day -- a woman with fewer resources than i have need not have been at a loss,1,1,0.7850317353719429
this is very true said she at least as far as relates to me which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful -- of the same age -- and always knowing her -- i ought to have been more her friend -- she will never like me now i have neglected her too long but i will shew her greater attention than i have done,1,1,0.8940925849948902
she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself by representing that though he certainly would make them nine yet he always said so little that the increase of noise would be very immaterial she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother,1,1,0.8899520510251605
no but it did not absolutely rain when i set out,1,1,0.6558678465288811
i must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of every dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters,1,1,0.7820078216248703
i have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly business you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever does,1,1,0.702880796764427
when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years said john knightley i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings i consider one as including the other time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle -- but that is not the change i had in view for you as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have,1,1,0.9609436096124845
it was kindly said and very far from giving offence a pleasant thank you seemed meant to laugh it off but a blush a quivering lip a tear in the eye shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh her attention was now claimed by mr woodhouse who being according to his custom on such occasions making the circle of his guests and paying his particular compliments to the ladies was ending with her -- and with all his mildest urbanity said,1,1,0.9131826716141488
you are extremely kind said jane but i cannot give up my early walk i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk somewhere and the post-office is an object and upon my word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before,1,1,0.8472765774677894
i have heard it asserted said john knightley that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough but for that reason i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get isabella and emma i think do write very much alike i have not always known their writing apart,1,1,0.951949278784644
she could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition and the expense of the irish mails -- it was at her tongue's end -- but she abstained she was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt jane fairfax's feelings and they followed the other ladies out of the room arm in arm with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each,1,1,0.9092002287626983
oh my dear we cannot begin too early you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing,1,1,0.8417551449986546
i did not mean i was not thinking of the slave-trade replied jane governess-trade i assure you was all that i had in view widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on but as to the greater misery of the victims i do not know where it lies but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do,1,1,0.8162733013385332
i know you i know you you would take up with any thing but i shall be a little more nice and i am sure the good campbells will be quite on my side with your superior talents you have a right to move in the first circle your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms have as many rooms as you like and mix in the family as much as you chose -- that is -- i do not know -- if you knew the harp you might do all that i am very sure but you sing as well as play -- yes i really believe you might even without the harp stipulate for what you chose -- and you must and shall be delightfully honourably and comfortably settled before the campbells or i have any rest,1,1,0.8210649199811623
you may well class the delight the honour and the comfort of such a situation together said jane they are pretty sure to be equal however i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me i am exceedingly obliged to you mrs elton i am obliged to any body who feels for me but i am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am and as i am,1,1,0.986292124930374
and i am quite serious too i assure you replied mrs elton gaily in resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends to watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us,1,1,0.8222499158798726
the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when mr weston made his appearance among them he had returned to a late dinner and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over he had been too much expected by the best judges for surprize -- but there was great joy mr woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now as he would have been sorry to see him before john knightley only was in mute astonishment -- that a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london should set off again and walk half a mile to another man's house for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers was a circumstance to strike him deeply a man who had been in motion since eight o'clock in the morning and might now have been still who had been long talking and might have been silent who had been in more than one crowd and might have been alone -- such a man to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the world -- could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife there would have been a motive but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party john knightley looked at him with amazement then shrugged his shoulders and said i could not have believed it even of him,1,1,0.9720739289381429
the two ladies looked over it together and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued but very audible to every body,1,1,0.5799900792934851
you have heard of a certain frank churchill i presume he continued -- and know him to be my son though he does not bear my name,1,1,0.8973598510876641
and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her oh mr weston -- laughing affectedly i must protest against that -- a most dangerous precedent indeed -- i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example -- upon my word if this is what i am to expect we married women must begin to exert ourselves -- oh mr weston i could not have believed it of you,1,1,0.918206532306568
indeed -- from yorkshire i think enscombe is in yorkshire,1,1,0.7371944566892678
aye -- like maple grove i dare say nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove such an immense plantation all round it you seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement -- and mrs churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion or perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life i always say a woman cannot have too many resources -- and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society,1,1,0.9512154932504533
she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing and mr weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on,1,1,0.8176850559321485
i hope said he presently i have not been severe upon poor mrs churchill if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish you cannot be ignorant mrs elton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid to her she was the instigator frank's mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her mr churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wife's his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome but her pride is arrogance and insolence and what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has out-churchill'd them all in high and mighty claims but in herself i assure you she is an upstart,1,1,0.9925811075920931
they were interrupted tea was carrying round and mr weston having said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of walking away,1,1,0.8607202531660066
well emma i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the boys but you have your sister's letter and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure my charge would be much more concise than her's and probably not much in the same spirit all that i have to recommend being comprised in do not spoil them and do not physic them,1,1,0.9175898078364506
and if you find them troublesome you must send them home again,1,1,0.6485134463605208
very well -- and as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma that henry and john may be sometimes in the way and if they are i only beg you to send them home,1,1,0.9638110685573481
upon my word exclaimed emma you amuse me i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys these amazing engagements of mine -- what have they been dining once with the coles -- and having a ball talked of which never took place i can understand you -- nodding at mr john knightley -- your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed but you turning to mr knightley who know how very very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me i cannot imagine and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one -- and who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling his accounts,1,1,0.9863698329058181
he was in high spirits as ready to talk and laugh as ever and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit and recur to old stories and he was not without agitation it was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference he was not calm his spirits were evidently fluttered there was restlessness about him lively as he was it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself but what decided her belief on the subject was his staying only a quarter of an hour and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury he had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed -- he had not stopped he would not stop for more than a word -- but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield he must hurry off she had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed like a perfect cure and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long,1,1,0.9800721078261188
mr weston's ball was to be a real thing a very few to-morrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness,1,1,0.9308868550923374
mr woodhouse was resigned the time of year lightened the evil to him may was better for every thing than february mrs bates was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield james had due notice and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any thing the matter with them while dear emma were gone,1,1,0.9960930693198801
no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma the room at the crown was to witness it -- but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd mr weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came that she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company she was to convey harriet and they drove to the crown in good time the randalls party just sufficiently before them,1,1,0.9893057652434093
emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr weston depended and felt that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity she liked his open manners but a little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher character -- general benevolence but not general friendship made a man what he ought to be -- she could fancy such a man the whole party walked about and looked and praised again and then having nothing else to do formed a sort of half-circle round the fire to observe in their various modes till other subjects were started that though may a fire in the evening was still very pleasant,1,1,0.9754855970079922
frank was standing by her but not steadily there was a restlessness which shewed a mind not at ease he was looking about he was going to the door he was watching for the sound of other carriages -- impatient to begin or afraid of being always near her,1,1,0.7319553636264285
the mistake had been slight the carriage was sent for them now emma longed to know what frank's first opinion of mrs elton might be how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress and her smiles of graciousness he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion by giving her very proper attention after the introduction had passed,1,1,0.9936308756356677
mrs elton turned to mrs weston i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious -- i believe we drive faster than any body -- what a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend -- i understand you were so kind as to offer but another time it will be quite unnecessary you may be very sure i shall always take care of them,1,1,0.9917771535717493
at this moment frank began talking so vigorously that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises and did not want to hear more -- and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while till another suspension brought mrs elton's tones again distinctly forward -- mr elton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming,1,1,0.9640543945793337
ungrateful -- what do you mean then changing from a frown to a smile -- no do not tell me -- i do not want to know what you mean -- where is my father -- when are we to begin dancing,1,0,0.2709977533425879
emma could hardly understand him he seemed in an odd humour he walked off to find his father but was quickly back again with both mr and mrs weston he had met with them in a little perplexity which must be laid before emma it had just occurred to mrs weston that mrs elton must be asked to begin the ball that she would expect it which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction -- emma heard the sad truth with fortitude,1,1,0.9944260132863677
frank turned instantly to emma to claim her former promise and boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that mrs weston was wanting him to dance with mrs elton himself and that their business was to help to persuade him into it which was done pretty soon -- mr weston and mrs elton led the way mr frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed emma must submit to stand second to mrs elton though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her it was almost enough to make her think of marrying mrs elton had undoubtedly the advantage at this time in vanity completely gratified for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill she could not lose by the change mr weston might be his son's superior -- in spite of this little rub however emma was smiling with enjoyment delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her -- she was more disturbed by mr knightley's not dancing than by any thing else -- there he was among the standers-by where he ought not to be he ought to be dancing -- not classing himself with the husbands and fathers and whist-players who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up -- so young as he looked -- he could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere than where he had placed himself his tall firm upright figure among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men was such as emma felt must draw every body's eyes and excepting her own partner there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him -- he moved a few steps nearer and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner with what natural grace he must have danced would he but take the trouble -- whenever she caught his eye she forced him to smile but in general he was looking grave she wished he could love a ballroom better and could like frank churchill better -- he seemed often observing her she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour she did not feel afraid there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner they seemed more like cheerful easy friends than lovers that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done was indubitable,1,1,0.9993917128458079
the ball proceeded pleasantly the anxious cares the incessant attentions of mrs weston were not thrown away every body seemed happy and the praise of being a delightful ball which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this of very important very recordable events it was not more productive than such meetings usually are there was one however which emma thought something of -- the two last dances before supper were begun and harriet had no partner -- the only young lady sitting down -- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder -- but emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards on seeing mr elton sauntering about he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room,1,1,0.9955290112357341
in another moment a happier sight caught her -- mr knightley leading harriet to the set -- never had she been more surprized seldom more delighted than at that instant she was all pleasure and gratitude both for harriet and herself and longed to be thanking him and though too distant for speech her countenance said much as soon as she could catch his eye again,1,1,0.9894834098815243
knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith -- very goodnatured i declare,1,1,0.9870163134651303
they aimed at wounding more than harriet said he emma why is it that they are your enemies,1,1,0.6960712329091053
he looked with smiling penetration and on receiving no answer added she ought not to be angry with you i suspect whatever he may be -- to that surmise you say nothing of course but confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet,1,1,0.943090316217573
i shall not scold you i leave you to your own reflections,1,1,0.678417148464116
whom are you going to dance with asked mr knightley,1,1,0.7652239992003175
the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice they took themselves off in a hurry the young ladies of highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma and her nephews -- in her imagination it maintained its ground and henry and john were still asking every day for the story of harriet and the gipsies and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital,1,1,0.9164724236970081
miss woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- i have something that i should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then you know it will be over,1,1,0.7842763655594919
dear me i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court-plaister one of the very last times we ever met in it -- it was but a very few days before i had my sore throat -- just before mr and mrs john knightley came -- i think the very evening -- do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife and your recommending court-plaister -- but as you had none about you and knew i had you desired me to supply him and so i took mine out and cut him a piece but it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me and so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it -- so i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then as a great treat,1,1,0.7653296346225411
my dearest harriet cried emma putting her hand before her face and jumping up you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear remember it aye i remember it all now all except your saving this relic -- i knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger and my recommending court-plaister and saying i had none about me -- oh my sins my sins -- and i had plenty all the while in my pocket -- one of my senseless tricks -- i deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life -- well -- sitting down again -- go on -- what else,1,1,0.5984358952659684
emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure it was the end of an old pencil -- the part without any lead,1,1,0.6903329968098428
yes simpleton as i was -- but i am quite ashamed of it now and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them it was very wrong of me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married i knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them,1,1,0.8584357707025712
i shall be happier to burn it replied harriet it has a disagreeable look to me i must get rid of every thing -- there it goes and there is an end thank heaven of mr elton,1,1,0.8719048315073004
and when thought emma will there be a beginning of mr churchill,1,1,0.9670361549786785
mr elton indeed cried harriet indignantly -- oh no -- and emma could just catch the words so superior to mr elton,1,1,0.9832180139363502
in this state of schemes and hopes and connivance june opened upon hartfield to highbury in general it brought no material change the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau and jane fairfax was still at her grandmother's and as the return of the campbells from ireland was again delayed and august instead of midsummer fixed for it she was likely to remain there full two months longer provided at least she were able to defeat mrs elton's activity in her service and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will,1,1,0.9951147069765642
mr knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly taken an early dislike to frank churchill was only growing to dislike him more he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of emma that emma was his object appeared indisputable every thing declared it his own attentions his father's hints his mother-in-law's guarded silence it was all in unison words conduct discretion and indiscretion told the same story but while so many were devoting him to emma and emma herself making him over to harriet mr knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax he could not understand it but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least -- symptoms of admiration on his side which having once observed he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning however he might wish to escape any of emma's errors of imagination she was not present when the suspicion first arose he was dining with the randalls family and jane at the eltons' and he had seen a look more than a single look at miss fairfax which from the admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place when he was again in their company he could not help remembering what he had seen nor could he avoid observations which unless it were like cowper and his fire at twilight,1,1,0.9985903066596282
upon my word i never heard of it till this moment,1,0,0.47006103284203404
it is odd though observed his father that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe perry's setting up his carriage and his wife's persuading him to it out of care for his health -- just what will happen i have no doubt some time or other only a little premature what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream and at others what a heap of absurdities it is well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent emma you are a great dreamer i think,1,1,0.902331399373354
between mr frank churchill and miss fairfax oh yes perfectly -- why do you make a doubt of it,1,1,0.9845105826903013
i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them -- certain expressive looks which i did not believe meant to be public,1,1,0.9060740698742554
she spoke with a confidence which staggered with a satisfaction which silenced mr knightley she was in gay spirits and would have prolonged the conversation wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions every look described and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her but his gaiety did not meet hers he found he could not be useful and his feelings were too much irritated for talking that he might not be irritated into an absolute fever by the fire which mr woodhouse's tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year he soon afterwards took a hasty leave and walked home to the coolness and solitude of donwell abbey,1,1,0.9887575792154044
mrs elton was very much disappointed it was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade her introductions and recommendations must all wait and every projected party be still only talked of so she thought at first -- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off why should not they explore to box hill though the sucklings did not come they could go there again with them in the autumn it was settled that they should go to box hill that there was to be such a party had been long generally known it had even given the idea of another emma had never been to box hill she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing and she and mr weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to be done in a quiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation the regular eating and drinking and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings,1,1,0.9907012167191089
it was now the middle of june and the weather fine and mrs elton was growing impatient to name the day and settle with mr weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty it might be weeks it might be only a few days before the horse were useable but no preparations could be ventured on and it was all melancholy stagnation mrs elton's resources were inadequate to such an attack,1,1,0.9548972989383915
-- mrs weston i suppose interrupted mrs elton rather mortified,1,1,0.9876074142309964
no -- mrs knightley -- and till she is in being i will manage such matters myself,1,1,0.9282919313203607
that's quite unnecessary i see jane every day -- but as you like it is to be a morning scheme you know knightley quite a simple thing i shall wear a large bonnet and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm here -- probably this basket with pink ribbon nothing can be more simple you see and jane will have such another there is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party we are to walk about your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves and sit under trees -- and whatever else you may like to provide it is to be all out of doors -- a table spread in the shade you know every thing as natural and simple as possible is not that your idea,1,1,0.5536699948563245
you will not find either between donwell and highbury donwell lane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry come on a donkey however if you prefer it you can borrow mrs cole's i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible,1,1,0.9596525400258769
in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast that the party to box hill was again under happy consideration and at last donwell was settled for one day and box hill for the next -- the weather appearing exactly right,1,1,0.7324746846583846
she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building its suitable becoming characteristic situation low and sheltered -- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream of which the abbey with all the old neglect of prospect had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up -- the house was larger than hartfield and totally unlike it covering a good deal of ground rambling and irregular with many comfortable and one or two handsome rooms -- it was just what it ought to be and it looked what it was -- and emma felt an increasing respect for it as the residence of a family of such true gentility untainted in blood and understanding -- some faults of temper john knightley had but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably she had given them neither men nor names nor places that could raise a blush these were pleasant feelings and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did and collect round the strawberry-beds -- the whole party were assembled excepting frank churchill who was expected every moment from richmond and mrs elton in all her apparatus of happiness her large bonnet and her basket was very ready to lead the way in gathering accepting or talking -- strawberries and only strawberries could now be thought or spoken of -- the best fruit in england -- every body's favourite -- always wholesome -- these the finest beds and finest sorts -- delightful to gather for one's self -- the only way of really enjoying them -- morning decidedly the best time -- never tired -- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison -- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce -- chili preferred -- white wood finest flavour of all -- price of strawberries in london -- abundance about bristol -- maple grove -- cultivation -- beds when to be renewed -- gardeners thinking exactly different -- no general rule -- gardeners never to be put out of their way -- delicious fruit -- only too rich to be eaten much of -- inferior to cherries -- currants more refreshing -- only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping -- glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer -- must go and sit in the shade,1,1,0.9737399889700418
she spoke with great agitation and emma very feelingly replied that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now i must order the carriage the heat even would be danger -- you are fatigued already,1,1,0.9243757497690699
i am -- she answered -- i am fatigued but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me -- miss woodhouse we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits mine i confess are exhausted the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let me have my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary,1,1,0.8023970782792383
emma had not another word to oppose she saw it all and entering into her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend her parting look was grateful -- and her parting words oh miss woodhouse the comfort of being sometimes alone -- seemed to burst from an overcharged heart and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her even towards some of those who loved her best,1,1,0.9612460051773811
such a home indeed such an aunt said emma as she turned back into the hall again i do pity you and the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors the more i shall like you,1,1,0.7923633406046386
i am glad i have done being in love with him i should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning harriet's sweet easy temper will not mind it,1,1,0.84842393844954
as soon as my aunt gets well i shall go abroad said he i shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places you will have my sketches some time or other to look at -- or my tour to read -- or my poem i shall do something to expose myself,1,0,0.4531519122547557
but you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning,1,0,0.4308888394906292
at first it was downright dulness to emma she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid he said nothing worth hearing -- looked without seeing -- admired without intelligence -- listened without knowing what she said while he was so dull it was no wonder that harriet should be dull likewise and they were both insufferable,1,1,0.9755562108473924
perhaps i intended you to say so but i meant self-command you had somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own management but to-day you are got back again -- and as i cannot be always with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine,1,1,0.5091985961542067
your gallantry is really unanswerable but lowering her voice -- nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people,1,1,0.5947413640651118
oh very well exclaimed miss bates then i need not be uneasy three things very dull indeed ' that will just do for me you know i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open my mouth shan't i looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on every body's assent -- do not you all think i shall,1,1,0.7085189245081909
understanding and gratification came together it might be a very indifferent piece of wit but emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it -- and so did frank and harriet -- it did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally some looked very stupid about it and mr knightley gravely said,1,1,0.961406230489516
with all my heart i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot come jane take my other arm,1,1,0.5802507134176795
you were speaking said he gravely she recovered her voice,1,1,0.5380852738187748
very well i undertake the commission you shall have a charming wife,1,1,0.6713179710765718
she must be very lively and have hazle eyes i care for nothing else i shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when i return i shall come to you for my wife remember,1,1,0.8014925558864302
now ma'am said jane to her aunt shall we join mrs elton,1,1,0.9849103544885225
if you please my dear with all my heart i am quite ready i was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well we shall soon overtake her there she is -- no that's somebody else that's one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her -- well i declare --,1,1,0.7862243843755774
while waiting for the carriage she found mr knightley by her side he looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said,1,1,0.824181562332735
so very kind replied miss bates but you are always kind,1,1,0.9233697981075523
mrs elton i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes --,1,1,0.9782541455604035
yes our good mrs elton the most indefatigable true friend she would not take a denial she would not let jane say no ' for when jane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday the very morning we were at donwell when jane first heard of it she was quite decided against accepting the offer and for the reasons you mention exactly as you say she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbell's return and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told mrs elton over and over again -- and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind -- but that good mrs elton whose judgment never fails her saw farther than i did it is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did and refuse to take jane's answer but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday as jane wished her she would wait -- and sure enough yesterday evening it was all settled that jane should go quite a surprize to me i had not the least idea -- jane took mrs elton aside and told her at once that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs smallridge's situation she had come to the resolution of accepting it -- i did not know a word of it till it was all settled,1,1,0.9985524746341158
what mr elton had learned from the ostler on the subject being the accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge and the knowledge of the servants at randalls was that a messenger had come over from richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill -- which messenger however had been no more than was expected and that mr churchill had sent his nephew a few lines containing upon the whole a tolerable account of mrs churchill and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early but that mr frank churchill having resolved to go home directly without waiting at all and his horse seeming to have got a cold tom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by the boy going a good pace and driving very steady,1,1,0.9809604634779152
emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise and with a smile and shake of the head which spoke much she looked at mr knightley -- it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour as if his eyes received the truth from her's and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured -- he looked at her with a glow of regard she was warmly gratified -- and in another moment still more so by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part -- he took her hand -- whether she had not herself made the first motion she could not say -- she might perhaps have rather offered it -- but he took her hand pressed it and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips -- when from some fancy or other he suddenly let it go -- why he should feel such a scruple why he should change his mind when it was all but done she could not perceive -- he would have judged better she thought if he had not stopped -- the intention however was indubitable and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry or however else it happened but she thought nothing became him more -- it was with him of so simple yet so dignified a nature -- she could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction it spoke such perfect amity -- he left them immediately afterwards -- gone in a moment he always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance,1,1,0.9706896116401539
the following day brought news from richmond to throw every thing else into the background an express arrived at randalls to announce the death of mrs churchill though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account she had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return a sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state had carried her off after a short struggle the great mrs churchill was no more,1,1,0.9633137732467959
emma felt that her own note had deserved something better but it was impossible to quarrel with words whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted in spite of the answer therefore she ordered the carriage and drove to mrs bates's in the hope that jane would be induced to join her -- but it would not do -- miss bates came to the carriage door all gratitude and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried -- but all in vain miss bates was obliged to return without success jane was quite unpersuadable the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse -- emma wished she could have seen her and tried her own powers but almost before she could hint the wish miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let miss woodhouse in indeed the truth was that poor dear jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all -- mrs elton indeed could not be denied -- and mrs cole had made such a point -- and mrs perry had said so much -- but except them jane would really see nobody,1,1,0.9998008087594461
emma did not want to be classed with the mrs eltons the mrs perrys and the mrs coles who would force themselves anywhere neither could she feel any right of preference herself -- she submitted therefore and only questioned miss bates farther as to her niece's appetite and diet which she longed to be able to assist on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy and very communicative jane would hardly eat any thing -- mr perry recommended nourishing food but every thing they could command and never had any body such good neighbours was distasteful,1,1,0.998779123604675
when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows at some distance from highbury on the afternoon of the very day on which she had under the plea of being unequal to any exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together -- that jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her she was sorry very sorry her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits inconsistency of action and inequality of powers and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling or esteemed so little worthy as a friend but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good and of being able to say to herself that could mr knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax could he even have seen into her heart he would not on this occasion have found any thing to reprove,1,1,0.9984082368523163
can you come to randalls at any time this morning -- do if it be possible mrs weston wants to see you she must see you,1,1,0.9488333737629997
no no not at all -- only a little agitated she would have ordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you alone and that you know -- nodding towards her father -- humph -- can you come,1,1,0.6811029953724916
depend upon me -- but ask no more questions you will know it all in time the most unaccountable business but hush hush,1,0,0.4928434644148919
now -- said emma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates -- now mr weston do let me know what has happened,1,1,0.7707600201269604
no no -- he gravely replied -- don't ask me i promised my wife to leave it all to her she will break it to you better than i can do not be impatient emma it will all come out too soon,1,1,0.7814968220513696
so far as that it relates to mr frank churchill i do guess,1,1,0.9426587445510386
mrs weston looked up afraid to believe but emma's countenance was as steady as her words,1,1,0.9553669789737034
that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my present perfect indifference she continued i will farther tell you that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance when i did like him when i was very much disposed to be attached to him -- nay was attached -- and how it came to cease is perhaps the wonder fortunately however it did cease i have really for some time past for at least these three months cared nothing about him you may believe me mrs weston this is the simple truth,1,1,0.9457854564413047
and how could she bear such behaviour composure with a witness to look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman before her face and not resent it -- that is a degree of placidity which i can neither comprehend nor respect,1,1,0.9086931463073445
there were misunderstandings between them emma he said so expressly he had not time to enter into much explanation he was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay -- but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said the present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by them and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct,1,1,0.8661966506801868
impropriety oh mrs weston -- it is too calm a censure much much beyond impropriety -- it has sunk him i cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion so unlike what a man should be -- none of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth and principle that disdain of trick and littleness which a man should display in every transaction of his life,1,1,0.8702729840508366
i am to hear from him soon continued mrs weston he told me at parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now let us wait therefore for this letter it may bring many extenuations it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood don't let us be severe don't let us be in a hurry to condemn him let us have patience i must love him and now that i am satisfied on one point the one material point i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready to hope that it may they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment,1,1,0.9063141802012082
ah thought emma he would have done as much for harriet,1,1,0.9728349374506329
well said emma i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea and i wish them very happy but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit -- espionage and treachery -- to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity and such a league in secret to judge us all -- here have we been the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear -- they must take the consequence if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable,1,1,0.8960692820761054
a glance or two between him and his wife convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate his air and voice recovered their usual briskness he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered on the subject in a manner to prove that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing his companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence or smooth objections and by the time they had talked it all over together and he had talked it all over again with emma in their walk back to hartfield he was become perfectly reconciled and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could possibly have done,1,1,0.9690841167496429
well miss woodhouse cried harriet coming eagerly into the room -- is not this the oddest news that ever was,1,1,0.9526687141887946
what news do you mean replied emma unable to guess by look or voice whether harriet could indeed have received any hint,1,1,0.9676141857994821
me cried harriet colouring and astonished why should you caution me -- you do not think i care about mr frank churchill,1,1,0.9591147878941697
she could not speak another word -- her voice was lost and she sat down waiting in great terror till harriet should answer,1,1,0.7240196408527846
harriet who had been standing in no unhappy reverie was yet very glad to be called from it by the now encouraging manner of such a judge and such a friend as miss woodhouse and only wanted invitation to give the history of her hopes with great though trembling delight -- emma's tremblings as she asked and as she listened were better concealed than harriet's but they were not less her voice was not unsteady but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self such a burst of threatening evil such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions must create -- she listened with much inward suffering but with great outward patience to harriet's detail -- methodical or well arranged or very well delivered it could not be expected to be but it contained when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration a substance to sink her spirit -- especially with the corroborating circumstances which her own memory brought in favour of mr knightley's most improved opinion of harriet,1,1,0.9947561052175056
the rest of the day the following night were hardly enough for her thoughts -- she was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours every moment had brought a fresh surprize and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her -- how to understand it all how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself and living under -- the blunders the blindness of her own head and heart -- she sat still she walked about she tried her own room she tried the shrubbery -- in every place every posture she perceived that she had acted most weakly that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying that she was wretched and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness,1,1,0.9437341912776253
till now that she was threatened with its loss emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being first with mr knightley first in interest and affection -- satisfied that it was so and feeling it her due she had enjoyed it without reflection and only in the dread of being supplanted found how inexpressibly important it had been -- long very long she felt she had been first for having no female connexions of his own there had been only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella she had herself been first with him for many years past she had not deserved it she had often been negligent or perverse slighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of half his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still from family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind he had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour to improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no other creature had at all shared in spite of all her faults she knew she was dear to him might she not say very dear -- when the suggestions of hope however which must follow here presented themselves she could not presume to indulge them harriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly exclusively passionately loved by mr knightley she could not she could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to her she had received a very recent proof of its impartiality -- how shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates how directly how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject -- not too strongly for the offence -- but far far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill -- she had no hope nothing to deserve the name of hope that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question but there was a hope at times a slight one at times much stronger that harriet might have deceived herself and be overrating his regard for her -- wish it she must for his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself but his remaining single all his life could she be secure of that indeed of his never marrying at all she believed she should be perfectly satisfied -- let him but continue the same mr knightley to her and her father the same mr knightley to all the world let donwell and hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence and her peace would be fully secured -- marriage in fact would not do for her it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father and with what she felt for him nothing should separate her from her father she would not marry even if she were asked by mr knightley,1,1,0.9995630610980438
on the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment of so many months continued mrs weston she was energetic this was one of her expressions i will not say that since i entered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments but i can say that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour ' -- and the quivering lip emma which uttered it was an attestation that i felt at my heart,1,1,0.979928255891009
wrong no one i believe can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself the consequence ' said she has been a state of perpetual suffering to me and so it ought but after all the punishment that misconduct can bring it is still not less misconduct pain is no expiation i never can be blameless i have been acting contrary to all my sense of right and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken and the kindness i am now receiving is what my conscience tells me ought not to be ' do not imagine madam ' she continued that i was taught wrong do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up the error has been all my own and i do assure you that with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give i shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell ',1,1,0.960874113632329
are you well my emma was mrs weston's parting question,1,1,0.9666592890592947
oh perfectly i am always well you know be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible,1,1,0.9388174463029959
the weather affected mr woodhouse and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before it reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete on the evening of mrs weston's wedding-day but mr knightley had walked in then soon after tea and dissipated every melancholy fancy alas such delightful proofs of hartfield's attraction as those sort of visits conveyed might shortly be over the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter had proved erroneous no friends had deserted them no pleasures had been lost -- but her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction the prospect before her now was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be even partially brightened if all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends hartfield must be comparatively deserted and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness,1,1,0.9955909644856542
the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself and mrs weston's heart and time would be occupied by it they should lose her and probably in great measure her husband also -- frank churchill would return among them no more and miss fairfax it was reasonable to suppose would soon cease to belong to highbury they would be married and settled either at or near enscombe all that were good would be withdrawn and if to these losses the loss of donwell were to be added what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach mr knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort -- no longer walking in at all hours as if ever willing to change his own home for their's -- how was it to be endured and if he were to be lost to them for harriet's sake if he were to be thought of hereafter as finding in harriet's society all that he wanted if harriet were to be the chosen the first the dearest the friend the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence what could be increasing emma's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind that it had been all her own work,1,1,0.997475609321956
when it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain from a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room for a few seconds -- and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own better conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past it would yet find her more rational more acquainted with herself and leave her less to regret when it were gone,1,1,0.9416408548012709
you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather surprize you,1,1,0.6354958808846777
i had a few lines on parish business from mr weston this morning and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened,1,1,0.8777891287449145
mr knightley said emma trying to be lively but really confused -- i am in a very extraordinary situation i cannot let you continue in your error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse -- but i never have,1,1,0.9702946678231834
he listened in perfect silence she wished him to speak but he would not she supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion she went on however,1,1,0.9174354751174226
i have no doubt of their being happy together said emma i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached,1,1,0.9533517551451094
oh then don't speak it don't speak it she eagerly cried take a little time consider do not commit yourself,1,0,0.3736389252068077
no -- replied emma -- quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke -- i should like to take another turn mr perry is not gone and after proceeding a few steps she added -- i stopped you ungraciously just now mr knightley and i am afraid gave you pain -- but if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend indeed you may command me -- i will hear whatever you like i will tell you exactly what i think,1,1,0.9495500998585742
he began -- stopping however almost directly to say had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference,1,1,0.9210923579805875
he proceeded a little farther reading to himself and then with a smile observed humph a fine complimentary opening but it is his way one man's style must not be the rule of another's we will not be severe,1,1,0.7153028643169987
mr knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity,1,1,0.9089690722459257
very bad -- though it might have been worse -- playing a most dangerous game too much indebted to the event for his acquittal -- no judge of his own manners by you -- always deceived in fact by his own wishes and regardless of little besides his own convenience -- fancying you to have fathomed his secret natural enough -- his own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it in others -- mystery finesse -- how they pervert the understanding my emma does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other,1,1,0.9117088808205333
emma agreed to it and with a blush of sensibility on harriet's account which she could not give any sincere explanation of,1,1,0.9876038827761555
say nothing my dear emma while you oblige me to read -- not even of mrs elton only one page more i shall soon have done what a letter the man writes,1,1,0.9571726192022609
yes certainly it does he has had great faults faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves but still as he is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax and will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with her i am very ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants and now let me talk to you of something else i have another person's interest at present so much at heart that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill ever since i left you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on one subject,1,1,0.9914347824757314
the subject followed it was in plain unaffected gentlemanlike english such as mr knightley used even to the woman he was in love with how to be able to ask her to marry him without attacking the happiness of her father emma's answer was ready at the first word while her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible for her she could never quit him part only of this answer however was admitted the impossibility of her quitting her father mr knightley felt as strongly as herself but the inadmissibility of any other change he could not agree to he had been thinking it over most deeply most intently he had at first hoped to induce mr woodhouse to remove with her to donwell he had wanted to believe it feasible but his knowledge of mr woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long and now he confessed his persuasion that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father's comfort perhaps even of his life which must not be hazarded mr woodhouse taken from hartfield -- no he felt that it ought not to be attempted but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this he trusted his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable it was that he should be received at hartfield that so long as her father's happiness in other words his life -- required hartfield to continue her home it should be his likewise,1,1,0.9986251608877265
in time of course mr knightley would be forgotten that is supplanted but this could not be expected to happen very early mr knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure -- not like mr elton mr knightley always so kind so feeling so truly considerate for every body would never deserve to be less worshipped than now and it really was too much to hope even of harriet that she could be in love with more than three men in one year,1,1,0.9937218176627823
it was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting their intercourse was painful enough by letter how much worse had they been obliged to meet,1,1,0.9898028284585705
now emma could indeed enjoy mr knightley's visits now she could talk and she could listen with true happiness unchecked by that sense of injustice of guilt of something most painful which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her how much might at that moment and at a little distance be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself,1,1,0.9778783114720961
this is most kind indeed -- miss woodhouse it is impossible for me to express -- i hope you will believe -- excuse me for being so entirely without words,1,1,0.9287451789664389
and again on emma's merely turning her head to look at mrs bates's knitting she added in a half whisper,1,1,0.9163087937239637
i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you miss woodhouse she shortly afterwards began since the party to box hill very pleasant party but yet i think there was something wanting things did not seem -- that is there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some -- so it appeared to me at least but i might be mistaken however i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again what say you both to our collecting the same party and exploring to box hill again while the fine weather lasts -- it must be the same party you know quite the same party not one exception,1,1,0.9130437389689186
upon my word it is miss bates -- he really is engaged from morning to night -- there is no end of people's coming to him on some pretence or other -- the magistrates and overseers and churchwardens are always wanting his opinion they seem not able to do any thing without him -- upon my word mr e ' i often say rather you than i -- i do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument if i had half so many applicants ' -- bad enough as it is for i absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree -- i believe i have not played a bar this fortnight -- however he is coming i assure you yes indeed on purpose to wait on you all and putting up her hand to screen her words from emma -- a congratulatory visit you know -- oh yes quite indispensable,1,1,0.9662813175552534
but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs bragge the only school and not more than five-and-twenty children,1,1,0.80787617909449
mr elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away his civilities to the other ladies must be paid but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering and the walk he had had for nothing,1,1,0.906007914647475
oh cried jane with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure -- there would have been no danger the danger would have been of my wearying you you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest -- indeed miss woodhouse speaking more collectedly with the consciousness which i have of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a degree as to -- i have not time for half that i could wish to say i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself i feel it so very due but unfortunately -- in short if your compassion does not stand my friend --,1,1,0.9940069336882639
mrs weston's friends were all made happy by her safety and if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to emma it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her hereafter with either of isabella's sons but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best it would be a great comfort to mr weston as he grew older -- and even mr weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home and mrs weston -- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have their powers in exercise again,1,1,0.9966011803426026
i remember once calling you george ' in one of my amiable fits about ten years ago i did it because i thought it would offend you but as you made no objection i never did it again,1,1,0.6668118362183307
yes yes -- but i am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings what has he been judging by -- i am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another -- but it was so i suppose i dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them the other day i believe i did not play with the children quite so much as usual i remember one evening the poor boys saying uncle seems always tired now ',1,1,0.9551013189496985
mr woodhouse could not be soon reconciled but the worst was overcome the idea was given time and continual repetition must do the rest -- to emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded mr knightley's whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome and he was soon used to be talked to by each on every fair occasion -- they had all the assistance which isabella could give by letters of the strongest approbation and mrs weston was ready on the first meeting to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first as a settled and secondly as a good one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr woodhouse's mind -- it was agreed upon as what was to be and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place,1,1,0.9980038194081751
mrs weston was acting no part feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event -- she had been extremely surprized never more so than when emma first opened the affair to her but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost -- she had such a regard for mr knightley as to think he deserved even her dearest emma and it was in every respect so proper suitable and unexceptionable a connexion and in one respect one point of the highest importance so peculiarly eligible so singularly fortunate that now it seemed as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it and wished it long ago -- how very few of those men in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own home for hartfield and who but mr knightley could know and bear with mr woodhouse so as to make such an arrangement desirable -- the difficulty of disposing of poor mr woodhouse had been always felt in her husband's plans and her own for a marriage between frank and emma how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had been a continual impediment -- less acknowledged by mr weston than by herself -- but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying -- those matters will take care of themselves the young people will find a way but here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future it was all right all open all equal no sacrifice on any side worth the name it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself and without one real rational difficulty to oppose or delay it,1,1,0.999580421658842
emma gave a start which did not seem like being prepared -- and her eyes in eager gaze said no this is impossible but her lips were closed,1,1,0.6543398981782219
you mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i cannot believe it it seems an impossibility -- you cannot mean to say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet you only mean that he intends it,1,1,0.9435567858166795
it is a very simple story he went to town on business three days ago and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send to john -- he delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley's they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley's the party was to be our brother and sister henry john -- and miss smith my friend robert could not resist they called for him in their way were all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit as i understand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet and certainly did not speak in vain -- she made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is deserving he came down by yesterday's coach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own this is all that i can relate of the how where and when your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her -- she will give you all the minute particulars which only woman's language can make interesting -- in our communications we deal only in the great -- however i must say that robert martin's heart seemed for him and to me very overflowing and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that on quitting their box at astley's my brother took charge of mrs john knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith rather uneasy,1,1,0.9937107932015373
you ought to know your friend best replied mr knightley but i should say she was a good-tempered soft-hearted girl not likely to be very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her,1,1,0.9682037307290575
do you dare say this cried mr knightley do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of -- what do you deserve,1,1,0.8267456418222187
she checked herself however and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved,1,1,0.8874231523130145
high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from mr knightley would soon be over the disguise equivocation mystery so hateful to her to practise might soon be over she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty,1,1,0.9151730601855359
that appears quite wonderful i was once very near -- and i wish i had -- it would have been better but though i was always doing wrong things they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no service -- it would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing,1,1,0.8475818841982632
i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us all -- i am sure you had -- i am sure it was a consolation to you,1,1,0.7702213843059059
the event however was most joyful and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so -- harriet's parentage became known she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers and decent enough to have always wished for concealment -- such was the blood of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for -- it was likely to be as untainted perhaps as the blood of many a gentleman but what a connexion had she been preparing for mr knightley -- or for the churchills -- or even for mr elton -- the stain of illegitimacy unbleached by nobility or wealth would have been a stain indeed,1,1,0.9881196349012656
no objection was raised on the father's side the young man was treated liberally it was all as it should be and as emma became acquainted with robert martin who was now introduced at hartfield she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend she had no doubt of harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man but with him and in the home he offered there would be the hope of more of security stability and improvement she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her and who had better sense than herself retired enough for safety and occupied enough for cheerfulness she would be never led into temptation nor left for it to find her out she would be respectable and happy and emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man -- or if not quite the luckiest to yield only to herself,1,1,0.9914268228216695
then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family in the usual terms how it had been first settled in cheshire how mentioned in dugdale serving the office of high sheriff representing a borough in three successive parliaments exertions of loyalty and dignity of baronet in the first year of charles ii with all the marys and elizabeths they had married forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages and concluding with the arms and motto -- principal seat kellynch hall in the county of somerset and sir walter's handwriting again in this finale --,1,1,0.8639789597289352
this friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance thirteen years had passed away since lady elliot's death and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends and one remained a widower the other a widow,1,1,0.9646836822412181
that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again than when she does not but sir walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation be it known then that sir walter like a good father having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake for one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thing which he had not been very much tempted to do elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen to all that was possible of her mother's rights and consequence and being very handsome and very like himself her influence had always been great and they had gone on together most happily his two other children were of very inferior value mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming mrs charles musgrove but anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding was nobody with either father or sister her word had no weight her convenience was always to give way -- she was only anne,1,1,0.9990795010534185
a few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem he had never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably,1,1,0.9638061692516398
she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially the history of her own family must ever present the remembrance of the heir presumptive the very william walter elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed her,1,1,0.9689988720711805
he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour was confirmed he was invited to kellynch hall he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year but he never came the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come and the next tidings were that he was married instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth,1,1,0.9704602225612476
this very awkward history of mr elliot was still after an interval of several years felt with anger by elizabeth who had liked the man for himself and still more for being her father's heir and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter elliot's eldest daughter there was not a baronet from a to z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal yet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was at this present time the summer of 1814 wearing black ribbons for his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again the disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over had he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends they had been informed spoken most disrespectfully of them all most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his own this could not be pardoned,1,1,0.9839309720266541
there was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of but had every acre been alienable it would have made no difference he had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power but he would never condescend to sell no he would never disgrace his name so far the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire as he had received it,1,1,0.8712969328371464
this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding his friends to be urging him she considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it she wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty she rated lady russell's influence highly and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own conscience prompted she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete than to half a reformation her knowledge of her father and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on through the whole list of lady russell's too gentle reductions,1,1,0.9800963750001737
sir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it and make bath preferred it was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expense two material advantages of bath over london had of course been given all their weight its more convenient distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russell's spending some part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction of lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been for bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there,1,1,0.9950066195300585
lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne's known wishes it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walter's feelings they must have been dreadful and with regard to anne's dislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising first from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there after her mother's death and secondly from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself,1,1,0.997889842093808
lady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think it must suit them all and as to her young friend's health by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge every danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must do both health and spirits good anne had been too little from home too little seen her spirits were not high a larger society would improve them she wanted her to be more known,1,1,0.9901888417023983
sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house mr shepherd had once mentioned the word advertise but never dared approach it again sir walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour that he would let it at all,1,1,0.9607918154086273
how quick come the reasons for approving what we like lady russell had another excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter and his family were to remove from the country elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned after an unprosperous marriage to her father's house with the additional burden of two children she was a clever young woman who understood the art of pleasing -- the art of pleasing at least at kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot as to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all that lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place could hint of caution and reserve,1,1,0.9945917125439164
there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description,1,1,0.730691103252332
the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow,1,1,0.76136764333643
but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not hear the appeal,1,1,0.9594075975430959
wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years came there about the year -- -5 i take it you remember him i am sure,1,1,0.91671837886474
it succeeded however and though sir walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty and authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still remained at taunton and fix a day for the house being seen,1,1,0.9165730585231409
nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her,1,1,0.9126659176265687
a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one troubles soon arose sir walter on being applied to without actually withholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all the negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter he thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though with more tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one,1,1,0.9655233451175071
anne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind to throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances of a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away which she grieved to think of anne elliot so young known to so few to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious youth-killing dependence it must not be if by any fair interference of friendship any representations from one who had almost a mother's love and mother's rights it would be prevented,1,1,0.9846163042043555
a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance but not with a few months ended anne's share of suffering from it her attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every enjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect,1,1,0.9823076829405096
the sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying her husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary had been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by the pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards,1,1,0.9462628206861752
i cannot possibly do without anne was mary's reasoning and elizabeth's reply was then i am sure anne had better stay for nobody will want her in bath,1,1,0.9840954480865303
so far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her which was mrs clay's being engaged to go to bath with sir walter and elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered grieved and feared and the affront it contained to anne in mrs clay's being of so much use while anne could be of none was a very sore aggravation,1,1,0.996265728918472
anne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell with a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge which she often wished less of her father's character she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind mrs clay had freckles and a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continually making severe remarks upon in her absence but she was young and certainly altogether well-looking and possessed in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister she had little hope of success but elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought have reason to reproach her for giving no warning,1,1,0.9986534326431824
there is hardly any personal defect replied anne which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to,1,1,0.9311052143902018
here anne had often been staying she knew the ways of uppercross as well as those of kellynch the two families were so continually meeting so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house at all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone but being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course though better endowed than the elder sister mary had not anne's understanding nor temper while well and happy and properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits but any indisposition sunk her completely she had no resources for solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot self-importance was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill-used in person she was inferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached the dignity of being a fine girl she was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing-room the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers and two children and on anne's appearing greeted her with --,1,1,0.9966816698284815
you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone it is early,1,0,0.46470535766551013
she had this communication moreover from mary mrs musgrove thinks all her servants so steady that it would be high treason to call it in question but i am sure without exaggeration that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid instead of being in their business are gadding about the village all day long i meet them wherever i go and i declare i never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them if jemima were not the trustiest steadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her for she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them and on mrs musgrove's side it was i make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter-in-law's concerns for i know it would not do but i shall tell you miss anne because you may be able to set things to rights that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles's nursery-maid i hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from my own knowledge i can declare she is such a fine-dressing lady that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near mrs charles quite swears by her i know but i just give you this hint that you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss you need not be afraid of mentioning it,1,1,0.9890410894985421
how was anne to set all these matters to rights she could do little more than listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each to the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister's benefit,1,1,0.8832994309201248
the rest was all tranquillity till just as they were moving she heard the admiral say to mary --,1,1,0.7141024689541733
we are expecting a brother of mrs croft's here soon i dare say you know him by name,1,1,0.9059177976506325
a very few days more and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch and mr musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praise and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross by the end of another week it had been a great disappointment to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed so impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth under his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars but a week must pass only a week in anne's reckoning and then she supposed they must meet and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week,1,1,0.9956080023008768
his collar-bone was found to be dislocated and such injury received in the back as roused the most alarming ideas it was an afternoon of distress and anne had every thing to do at once the apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed the mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control the youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession rather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants,1,1,0.9528369949530461
but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy,1,1,0.7946297191440895
well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go as well as your husband leave little charles to my care mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him,1,1,0.949178730218143
are you serious cried mary her eyes brightening dear me that's a very good thought very good indeed to be sure i may just as well go as not for i am of no use at home -- am i and it only harasses me you who have not a mother's feelings are a great deal the properest person you can make little charles do anything he always minds you at a word it will be a great deal better than leaving him only with jemima oh i shall certainly go i am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want me excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i know you do not mind being left alone an excellent thought of yours indeed anne i will go and tell charles and get ready directly you can send for us you know at a moment's notice if anything is the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease about my dear child,1,1,0.9778391981110294
this is very kind of anne was her husband's answer and i should be very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself to nurse our sick child,1,1,0.886217360962472
now how were his sentiments to be read was this like wishing to avoid her and the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question,1,1,0.8421860706311081
i felt my luck admiral i assure you replied captain wentworth seriously i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea a very great object i wanted to be doing something,1,1,0.9063389243971886
it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth,1,1,0.9287610170529301
charles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case only nodded in reply and walked away,1,1,0.629129517598716
and i am sure sir said mrs musgrove it was a lucky day for us when you were put captain into that ship we shall never forget what you did,1,1,0.7932512277712079
i might not like them the better for that perhaps such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board,1,1,0.7135657903032181
what a great traveller you must have been ma'am said mrs musgrove to mrs croft,1,1,0.9806880127937784
aye to be sure yes indeed oh yes i am quite of your opinion mrs croft was mrs musgrove's hearty answer there is nothing so bad as a separation i am quite of your opinion i know what it is for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when they are over and he is safe back again,1,1,0.9696906896583146
henrietta fully thought so herself before captain wentworth came but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten,1,1,0.9868237732017611
which of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was as yet quite doubtful as far as anne's observation reached henrietta was perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher spirits and she knew not now whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him,1,1,0.9830503361280039
charles had never seen a pleasanter man in his life and from what he had once heard captain wentworth himself say was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war here was a fortune at once besides which there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war and he was sure captain wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy oh it would be a capital match for either of his sisters,1,1,0.9583568663631146
upon my word it would replied mary dear me if he should rise to any very great honours if he should ever be made a baronet lady wentworth' sounds very well that would be a noble thing indeed for henrietta she would take place of me then and henrietta would not dislike that sir frederick and lady wentworth it would be but a new creation however and i never think much of your new creations,1,1,0.9476868559720549
it suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred on the very account of charles hayter whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed -- very sad for herself and her children,1,1,0.9739210041742267
charles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin's behaviour she had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from uppercross but there was such a change as became very alarming when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause he had been absent only two sundays and when they parted had left her interested even to the height of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy and obtaining that of uppercross instead it had then seemed the object nearest her heart that dr shirley the rector who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office but was now growing too infirm for many of them should be quite fixed on engaging a curate should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford and should give charles hayter the promise of it the advantage of his having to come only to uppercross instead of going six miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacy of his belonging to their dear dr shirley and of dear good dr shirley's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisa but had been almost everything to henrietta when he came back alas the zeal of the business was gone by louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley she was at a window looking out for captain wentworth and even henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation,1,1,0.9948085518363491
they are up stairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments i dare say had been anne's reply in all the confusion that was natural and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him she would have been out of the room the next moment and released captain wentworth as well as herself,1,1,0.957899037798652
she only attempted to say how do you do will you not sit down the others will be here presently,1,1,0.5894123328221702
just as they were setting off the gentlemen returned they had taken out a young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back early their time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready for this walk and they entered into it with pleasure could anne have foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home but from some feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it was too late to retract and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the miss musgroves who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance,1,1,0.9531713461808796
it is very unpleasant having such connexions but i assure you i have never been in the house above twice in my life,1,1,0.8253298705610227
she received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne perfectly knew the meaning of,1,1,0.7910355892436677
he had done and was unanswered it would have surprised anne if louisa could have readily answered such a speech words of such interest spoken with such serious warmth she could imagine what louisa was feeling for herself she feared to move lest she should be seen while she remained a bush of low rambling holly protected her and they were moving on before they were beyond her hearing however louisa spoke again,1,1,0.9747555817967382
mary is good-natured enough in many respects said she but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pride -- the elliot pride she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride we do so wish that charles had married anne instead i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne,1,1,0.9924383054770018
yes he had done it she was in the carriage and felt that he had placed her there that his will and his hands had done it that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue and his resolution to give her rest she was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her which all these things made apparent this little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before she understood him he could not forgive her but he could not be unfeeling though condemning her for the past and considering it with high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her and though becoming attached to another still he could not see her suffer without the desire of giving her relief it was a remainder of former sentiment it was an impulse of pure though unacknowledged friendship it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain that she knew not which prevailed,1,1,0.9825999550828652
he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophy said the admiral but there is no saying which he has been running after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind ay this comes of the peace if it were war now he would have settled it long ago we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war how many days was it my dear between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at north yarmouth,1,1,0.7461021519273161
she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain wentworth at the hall those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and captain wentworth never meeting anywhere they did not like each other and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady russell to see them together she might think that he had too much self-possession and she too little,1,1,0.9966351426142954
the party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms and still descending soon found themselves on the sea-shore and lingering only as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea who ever deserved to look on it at all proceeded towards the cobb equally their object in itself and on captain wentworth's account for in a small house near the foot of an old pier of unknown date were the harvilles settled captain wentworth turned in to call on his friend the others walked on and he was to join them on the cobb,1,1,0.7697412694840567
they all met and were introduced captain harville was a tall dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame and from strong features and want of health looking much older than captain wentworth captain benwick looked and was the youngest of the three and compared with either of them a little man he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air just as he ought to have and drew back from conversation,1,1,0.8725681860306901
on quitting the cobb they all went in-doors with their new friends and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many anne had a moment's astonishment on the subject herself but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville to turn the actual space to the best account to supply the deficiencies of lodging-house furniture and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected the varieties in the fitting-up of the rooms where the common necessaries provided by the owner in the common indifferent plight were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood excellently worked up and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries captain harville had visited were more than amusing to anne connected as it all was with his profession the fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented made it to her a something more or less than gratification,1,1,0.8713327301358192
captain harville was no reader but he had contrived excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes the property of captain benwick his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within he drew he varnished he carpentered he glued he made toys for the children he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with improvements and if everything else was done sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room,1,1,0.8431422775628947
anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in captain wentworth's company than she had at first imagined could ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it they never got beyond was become a mere nothing,1,1,0.9348128904490752
when the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing on more serious reflection that like many other great moralists and preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination,1,1,0.9573016220709741
the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own the servant in mourning roused anne's curiosity and the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off,1,1,0.864620171227399
there you see cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said heir to sir walter elliot i was sure that would come out if it was so depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish wherever he goes but anne only conceive how extraordinary i wish i had looked at him more i wish we had been aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other do you think he had the elliot countenance i hardly looked at him i was looking at the horses but i think he had something of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me oh the great-coat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them and the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning one should have known him by the livery,1,1,0.9367065043266549
miss elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much i wish he could have such company oftener it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he is but what can we do we cannot part,1,1,0.822287354586978
he caught the word it seemed to rouse him at once and saying only -- true true a surgeon this instant was darting away when anne eagerly suggested --,1,1,0.571718218056426
as to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said which of the three who were completely rational was suffering most captain wentworth anne or charles who really a very affectionate brother hung over louisa with sobs of grief and could only turn his eyes from one sister to see the other in a state as insensible or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife calling on him for help which he could not give,1,1,0.9727138139943343
anne attending with all the strength and zeal and thought which instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at intervals to suggest comfort to the others tried to quiet mary to animate charles to assuage the feelings of captain wentworth both seemed to look to her for directions,1,1,0.9625440694735192
captain wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her,1,1,0.7526977570653233
yes yes to the inn repeated captain wentworth comparatively collected and eager to be doing something i will carry her myself musgrove take care of the others,1,1,0.9026399456210552
the tone the look with which thank god was uttered by captain wentworth anne was sure could never be forgotten by her nor the sight of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them,1,1,0.6485309277850813
you will stay i am sure you will stay and nurse her cried he turning to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentleness which seemed almost restoring the past she coloured deeply and he recollected himself and moved away she expressed herself most willing ready happy to remain it was what she had been thinking of and wishing to be allowed to do a bed on the floor in louisa's room would be sufficient for her if mrs harville would but think so,1,1,0.9750390147526659
captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part and to be soon followed by the two ladies when the plan was made known to mary however there was an end of all peace in it she was so wretched and so vehement complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of anne anne who was nothing to louisa while she was her sister and had the best right to stay in henrietta's stead why was not she to be as useful as anne and to go home without charles too without her husband no it was too unkind and in short she said more than her husband could long withstand and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way there was no help for it the change of mary for anne was inevitable,1,1,0.9934591463188093
she endeavoured to be composed and to be just without emulating the feelings of an emma towards her henry she would have attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard for his sake and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend,1,1,0.9833618114081167
anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character and whether it might not strike him that like all other qualities of the mind it should have its proportions and limits she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character,1,1,0.9513004513788802
they got on fast anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon their actual speed heightened by some dread of the conclusion made the road appear but half as long as on the day before it was growing quite dusk however before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross and there had been total silence among them for some time henrietta leaning back in the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill anne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth in a low cautious voice he said --,1,1,0.863556512849793
she did he was satisfied and said no more but the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship and of deference for her judgement a great pleasure and when it became a sort of parting proof its value did not lessen,1,1,0.889512940570953
when the distressing communication at uppercross was over and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped and the daughter all the better for being with them he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme and when the horses were baited he was off,1,1,0.9472225400063782
they were indebted the next day to charles hayter for all the minute knowledge of louisa which it was so essential to obtain every twenty-four hours he made it his business to go to lyme and his account was still encouraging the intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger every report agreed in captain wentworth's appearing fixed in lyme,1,1,0.9865812307348942
she was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage she was the very last the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses of all that had given uppercross its cheerful character a few days had made a change indeed,1,1,0.9213274617234454
an hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these on a dark november day a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough to make the sound of lady russell's carriage exceedingly welcome and yet though desirous to be gone she could not quit the mansion house or look an adieu to the cottage with its black dripping and comfortless veranda or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village without a saddened heart scenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious it stood the record of many sensations of pain once severe but now softened and of some instances of relenting feeling some breathings of friendship and reconciliation which could never be looked for again and which could never cease to be dear she left it all behind her all but the recollection that such things had been,1,1,0.9082066250933634
the first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme which found their way to anne she could not tell how and brought a rather improving account of louisa at the end of that period lady russell's politeness could repose no longer and the fainter self-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone i must call on mrs croft i really must call upon her soon anne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that house it will be some trial to us both,1,1,0.9838039373105721
she could have said more on the subject for she had in fact so high an opinion of the crofts and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants felt the parish to be so sure of a good example and the poor of the best attention and relief that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay and that kellynch hall had passed into better hands than its owners' these convictions must unquestionably have their own pain and severe was its kind but they precluded that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again and returning through the well-known apartments,1,1,0.987241964581268
admiral croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell but they delighted anne his goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible,1,1,0.9714575814500871
well whenever it suits you you can slip in from the shrubbery at any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door a good place is not it but checking himself you will not think it a good place for yours were always kept in the butler's room ay so it always is i believe one man's ways may be as good as another's but we all like our own best and so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not,1,1,0.6030924631360446
anne amused in spite of herself was rather distressed for an answer and the admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough took up the subject again to say --,1,1,0.9461855026787593
oh captain benwick is very well i believe but he is a very odd young man i do not know what he would be at we asked him to come home with us for a day or two charles undertook to give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part i thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night he made a very awkward sort of excuse he never shot' and he had been quite misunderstood ' and he had promised this and he had promised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come i suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word i should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage for such a heart-broken man as captain benwick,1,1,0.9067444294481211
oh he talks of you cried charles in such terms -- mary interrupted him i declare charles i never heard him mention anne twice all the time i was there i declare anne he never talks of you at all,1,1,0.9744110005475765
no admitted charles i do not know that he ever does in a general way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation and he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks -- oh i cannot pretend to remember it but it was something very fine -- i overheard him telling henrietta all about it and then miss elliot' was spoken of in the highest terms now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were in the other room elegance sweetness beauty ' oh there was no end of miss elliot's charms,1,1,0.9743690251985724
yes that he will exclaimed mary tauntingly he will sit poring over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one drop's one's scissors or anything that happens do you think lady russell would like that,1,1,0.5942002857860404
lady russell began talking of something else mary spoke with animation of their meeting with or rather missing mr elliot so extraordinarily,1,1,0.9013951418931989
he is a man said lady russell whom i have no wish to see his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me,1,1,0.7756285161684533
this decision checked mary's eagerness and stopped her short in the midst of the elliot countenance,1,1,0.8906398047843063
there can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both occasionally thinking of captain benwick from this time lady russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father's grounds or any visit of charity in the village without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him captain benwick came not however he was either less disposed for it than charles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving him a week's indulgence lady russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite,1,1,0.996451973410633
the musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school bringing with them mrs harville's little children to improve the noise of uppercross and lessen that of lyme henrietta remained with louisa but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters,1,1,0.9771806389006358
anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance but she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not which was more than she could say for many other persons in bath,1,1,0.9738115373804966
they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered their expectations in every respect their house was undoubtedly the best in camden place their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up or the taste of the furniture their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after everybody was wanting to visit them they had drawn back from many introductions and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing,1,1,0.9654617755901658
here were funds of enjoyment could anne wonder that her father and sister were happy she might not wonder but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town and she must sigh and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw open the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the other boasting of their space at the possibility of that woman who had been mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud of between two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder,1,1,0.9581505827149883
they had not a fault to find in him he had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side it had originated in misapprehension entirely he had never had an idea of throwing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off but knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours he was quite indignant he who had ever boasted of being an elliot and whose feelings as to connection were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day he was astonished indeed but his character and general conduct must refute it he could refer sir walter to all who knew him and certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunity of reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir-presumptive was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject,1,1,0.9781698386551877
colonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquainted also with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story she was certainly not a woman of family but well educated accomplished rich and excessively in love with his friend there had been the charm she had sought him without that attraction not all her money would have tempted elliot and sir walter was moreover assured of her having been a very fine woman here was a great deal to soften the business a very fine woman with a large fortune in love with him sir walter seemed to admit it as complete apology and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light she allowed it be a great extenuation,1,1,0.994482196446706
oh no that must have been quite accidental in general she has been in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas,1,1,0.8805860732324392
if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds and grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse,1,0,0.178853803028135
however it might end he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in bath she saw nobody equal to him and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of as herself they went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times he gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness she knew it well and she remembered another person's look also,1,1,0.9513484702373456
while sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in laura place anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description,1,1,0.9713347386837622
their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from miss elliot would give mrs smith and anne therefore lost no time in going she mentioned nothing of what she had heard or what she intended at home it would excite no proper interest there she only consulted lady russell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments and was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smith's lodgings in westgate buildings as anne chose to be taken,1,1,0.9991909565165227
in the course of a second visit she talked with great openness and anne's astonishment increased she could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smith's she had been very fond of her husband she had buried him she had been used to affluence it was gone she had no child to connect her with life and happiness again no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs no health to make all the rest supportable her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroom behind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance which there was only one servant in the house to afford and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath yet in spite of all this anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression to hours of occupation and enjoyment how could it be she watched observed reflected and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only a submissive spirit might be patient a strong understanding would supply resolution but here was something more here was that elasticity of mind that disposition to be comforted that power of turning readily from evil to good and of finding employment which carried her out of herself which was from nature alone it was the choicest gift of heaven and anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which by a merciful appointment it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want,1,1,0.9931194022416675
there had been a time mrs smith told her when her spirits had nearly failed she could not call herself an invalid now compared with her state on first reaching bath then she had indeed been a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense she had weathered it however and could truly say that it had done her good it had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands she had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve and would not use her ill and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse as a sister of her landlady a nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house when unemployed chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her and she said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirably has really proved an invaluable acquaintance as soon as i could use my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases pin-cushions and card-racks which you always find me so busy about and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood she had a large acquaintance of course professionally among those who can afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandise she always takes the right time for applying everybody's heart is open you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain or are recovering the blessing of health and nurse rooke thoroughly understands when to speak she is a shrewd intelligent sensible woman hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has a fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received the best education in the world ' know nothing worth attending to call it gossip if you will but when nurse rooke has half an hour's leisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable something that makes one know one's species better one likes to hear what is going on to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly to me who live so much alone her conversation i assure you is a treat,1,1,0.9962024889765515
no sir she is not one-and-thirty but i do not think i can put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself she goes into the warm bath to-morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged,1,1,0.8476426378424542
but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance asked elizabeth,1,1,0.9439149393447671
lady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot she was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of his deserving her and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing she would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter of a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliance supposing such attachment to be real and returned anne heard her and made no violent exclamations she only smiled blushed and gently shook her head,1,1,0.9950515092009721
anne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant table and leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings this picture excited for a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched the idea of becoming what her mother had been of having the precious name of lady elliot first revived in herself of being restored to kellynch calling it her home again her home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist lady russell said not another word willing to leave the matter to its own operation and believing that could mr elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself -- she believed in short what anne did not believe the same image of mr elliot speaking for himself brought anne to composure again the charm of kellynch and of lady elliot all faded away she never could accept him and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one her judgement on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against mr elliot,1,1,0.9972284134539253
mr elliot was too generally agreeable various as were the tempers in her father's house he pleased them all he endured too well stood too well with every body he had spoken to her with some degree of openness of mrs clay had appeared completely to see what mrs clay was about and to hold her in contempt and yet mrs clay found him as agreeable as any body,1,1,0.9828185852633013
the crofts must be in bath a circumstance to interest her they were people whom her heart turned to very naturally,1,1,0.9288876489664402
what is this cried sir walter the crofts have arrived in bath the crofts who rent kellynch what have they brought you,1,1,0.9074637345620216
how is mary said elizabeth and without waiting for an answer and pray what brings the crofts to bath,1,1,0.8964950571012258
have they any acquaintance here asked elizabeth,1,1,0.8524884575256981
i suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place,1,1,0.9678468544572381
oh no i think not situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve if we were not related it would not signify but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours we had better leave the crofts to find their own level there are several odd-looking men walking about here who i am told are sailors the crofts will associate with them,1,1,0.953405384947404
this was sir walter and elizabeth's share of interest in the letter when mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention in an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove and her fine little boys anne was at liberty,1,1,0.9959768332731408
captain benwick and louisa musgrove the high-spirited joyous-talking louisa musgrove and the dejected thinking feeling reading captain benwick seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other their minds most dissimilar where could have been the attraction the answer soon presented itself it had been in situation they had been thrown together several weeks they had been living in the same small family party since henrietta's coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other and louisa just recovering from illness had been in an interesting state and captain benwick was not inconsolable that was a point which anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing the same conclusion as mary from the present course of events they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself she did not mean however to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than mary might have allowed she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment he had an affectionate heart he must love somebody,1,1,0.9984059999785068
the crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for and considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout and mrs croft seemed to go shares with him in everything and to walk for her life to do him good anne saw them wherever she went lady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning and she never failed to think of them and never failed to see them knowing their feelings as she did it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her she always watched them as long as she could delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of as they walked along in happy independence or equally delighted to see the admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy mrs croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her,1,1,0.9870472652033772
when they were got a little farther anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate she hoped when clear of milsom street to have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged to wait for the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of belmont and as she was not really mrs croft she must let him have his own way as soon as they were fairly ascending belmont he began --,1,1,0.9579107952841991
anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did but now she could safely suggest the name of louisa,1,1,0.9711252377694395
a little i am a little acquainted with captain benwick,1,1,0.9315842859625407
i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man said anne and i understand that he bears an excellent character,1,1,0.9567971574625335
well well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather too piano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality sophy and i cannot help thinking frederick's manners better than his there is something about frederick more to our taste,1,1,0.8833030235220922
and the thing is certainly true it is not a mere bit of gossip we have it from frederick himself his sister had a letter from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross i fancy they are all at uppercross,1,1,0.8974994234191273
yes yes i understand you but there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter he does not give the least fling at benwick does not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own for wondering at it ' no you would not guess from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this miss what's her name for himself he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is nothing very unforgiving in that i think,1,1,0.9231151623129943
poor frederick said he at last now he must begin all over again with somebody else i think we must get him to bath sophy must write and beg him to come to bath here are pretty girls enough i am sure it would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other miss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson do not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath,1,1,0.9765055535570655
her ladyship's carriage was a barouche and did not hold more than four with any comfort miss carteret was with her mother consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three camden place ladies there could be no doubt as to miss elliot whoever suffered inconvenience she must suffer none but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two the rain was a mere trifle and anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot but the rain was also a mere trifle to mrs clay she would hardly allow it even to drop at all and her boots were so thick much thicker than miss anne's and in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with mr elliot as anne could be and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were obliged to settle it for them miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay had a little cold already and mr elliot deciding on appeal that his cousin anne's boots were rather the thickest,1,1,0.9981750796160748
after a short interval however he came towards her and spoke again mutual enquiries on common subjects passed neither of them probably much the wiser for what they heard and anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly they had by dint of being so very much together got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness but he could not do it now time had changed him or louisa had changed him there was consciousness of some sort or other he looked very well not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits and he talked of uppercross of the musgroves nay even of louisa and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her but yet it was captain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he was,1,1,0.9922961935706083
after a moment's pause he said though i came only yesterday i have equipped myself properly for bath already you see pointing to a new umbrella i wish you would make use of it if you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair,1,1,0.7322718343305518
yes and miss atkinson who dined with him once at the wallises says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with,1,1,0.8452466513908209
she is pretty i think anne elliot very pretty when one comes to look at her it is not the fashion to say so but i confess i admire her more than her sister,1,1,0.9609923458711953
anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would have walked by her side all the way to camden place without saying a word she had never found it so difficult to listen to him though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects were principally such as were wont to be always interesting praise warm just and discriminating of lady russell and insinuations highly rational against mrs clay but just now she could think only of captain wentworth she could not understand his present feelings whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not and till that point were settled she could not be quite herself,1,1,0.9984165641437344
at last lady russell drew back her head now how would she speak of him,1,1,0.7848372954678197
she had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow mrs smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence,1,1,0.9797045142038575
anne named them all mrs smith made no reply but when she was leaving her said and with an expression half serious half arch well i heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail me to-morrow if you can come for i begin to have a foreboding that i may not have many more visits from you,1,1,0.9401083879550169
certainly i could have none but it appears -- i should hope it would be a very happy match there are on both sides good principles and good temper,1,1,0.8155505081822185
yes said he looking not exactly forward but there i think ends the resemblance with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it they have no difficulties to contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays the musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's comfort all this is much very much in favour of their happiness more than perhaps --,1,1,0.954013717653817
i confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity and in a point no less essential than mind i regard louisa musgrove as a very amiable sweet-tempered girl and not deficient in understanding but benwick is something more he is a clever man a reading man and i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise had it been the effect of gratitude had he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him it would have been another thing but i have no reason to suppose it so it seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous untaught feeling on his side and this surprises me a man like him in his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken fanny harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her was indeed attachment a man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman he ought not he does not,1,1,0.992144847386824
either from the consciousness however that his friend had recovered or from other consciousness he went no farther and anne who in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered and in spite of all the various noises of the room the almost ceaseless slam of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through had distinguished every word was struck gratified confused and beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred things in a moment it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject and yet after a pause feeling the necessity of speaking and having not the smallest wish for a total change she only deviated so far as to say --,1,1,0.8894930039435455
about a fortnight i could not leave it till louisa's doing well was quite ascertained i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace it had been my doing solely mine she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak the country round lyme is very fine i walked and rode a great deal and the more i saw the more i found to admire,1,1,0.916621294085312
upon lady russell's appearance soon afterwards the whole party was collected and all that remained was to marshal themselves and proceed into the concert room and be of all the consequence in their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispers and disturb as many people as they could,1,1,0.8821615579688894
anne's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening it was just occupation enough she had feelings for the tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific and patience for the wearisome and had never liked a concert better at least during the first act towards the close of it in the interval succeeding an italian song she explained the words of the song to mr elliot they had a concert bill between them,1,1,0.8742406491376993
i will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient,1,1,0.7861302835125734
for shame for shame this is too much flattery i forget what we are to have next turning to the bill,1,0,0.3895715280799994
perhaps said mr elliot speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of,1,1,0.9633395901098318
a well-looking man said sir walter a very well-looking man,1,1,0.5257888877436965
a very fine young man indeed said lady dalrymple more air than one often sees in bath irish i dare say,1,1,0.8644588138051792
she was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her though it had been an appointment,1,1,0.9692537041783909
i was not at all aware of this you never mentioned it before had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you,1,1,0.8607949748912199
no replied anne nor next week nor next nor next i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week i am not going to marry mr elliot i should like to know why you imagine i am,1,1,0.9349675401256962
mrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled shook her head and exclaimed --,1,1,0.8225820168216423
oh if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him do not forget me when you are married that's all let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same of course he cannot be aware of the importance to me well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been you are safe in all worldly matters and safe in his character he will not be led astray he will not be misled by others to his ruin,1,1,0.9639863546303711
no said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions i consider him with great respect i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation to do otherwise but i have not known him long and he is not a man i think to be known intimately soon will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me surely this must be calm enough and upon my word he is nothing to me should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him i assure you i shall not i assure you mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that --,1,1,0.9868337944782661
did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday,1,1,0.5368955656821663
it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by-the-bye had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way to let you in she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history the whole history repeated anne laughing she could not make a very long history i think of one such little article of unfounded news,1,1,0.9489975733108309
nay said anne i have no particular enquiry to make about her i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my father's acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr elliot draw back,1,1,0.9506340311278748
this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night cried anne this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you mr elliot married then completely for money the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character,1,1,0.9655041270964575
this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it,1,1,0.9042742272254595
he certainly did so far it is very true at lyme i happened to be at lyme,1,1,0.8508573388628902
yes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine there is always something offensive in the details of cunning the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not,1,1,0.9760381494628343
quite delightful cried mrs clay not daring however to turn her eyes towards anne exactly like father and son dear miss elliot may i not say father and son,1,1,0.9553570476749916
oh i lay no embargo on any body's words if you will have such ideas but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men,1,1,0.7304642264624119
to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her she had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere but now she saw insincerity in everything his attentive deference to her father contrasted with his former language was odious and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness or the sound of his artificial good sentiments,1,1,0.9827317888888412
anne's only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough for henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of she had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand but she learned from charles that very recently since mary's last letter to herself charles hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years and that on the strength of his present income with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question the two families had consented to the young people's wishes and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months quite as soon as louisa's and a very good living it was charles added only five-and-twenty miles from uppercross and in a very fine country fine part of dorsetshire in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom surrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous than the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get a special recommendation not that he will value it as he ought he observed charles is too cool about sporting that's the worst of him,1,1,0.9942677131031648
anne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay i am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now they seemed deep in talk who is it come and tell me good heavens i recollect it is mr elliot himself,1,1,0.9291060520518629
oh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do when you promised to go,1,1,0.8738593091081093
don't talk to me about heirs and representatives cried charles i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun if i would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir what is mr elliot to me the careless expression was life to anne who saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking and listening with his whole soul and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from charles to herself,1,1,0.856159068165405
if it depended only on my inclination ma'am the party at home excepting on mary's account would not be the smallest impediment i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy to change it for a play and with you but it had better not be attempted perhaps she had spoken it but she trembled when it was done conscious that her words were listened to and daring not even to try to observe their effect,1,1,0.9818527419064562
the interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out but not to anne she could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance she knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement for all the insolence of the past her spirits sank he held the card in his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it,1,1,0.9572589218417601
she only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of bath for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her there was guilt in mrs clay's face as she listened it was transient cleared away in an instant but anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick or some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend perhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on sir walter she exclaimed however with a very tolerable imitation of nature --,1,1,0.9933708813810121
materials were at hand on a separate table he went to it and nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing,1,0,0.2992518111021977
that is precisely what i was going to observe cried mrs croft i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in a long engagement i always think that no mutual --,1,1,0.972881770419664
captain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim that for your sex and she answered the question smiling also yes we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit we cannot help ourselves we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us you are forced on exertion you have always a profession pursuits business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions,1,1,0.8862770129836517
granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply to benwick he has not been forced upon any exertion the peace turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our little family circle ever since,1,1,0.7666019164927115
true said anne very true i did not recollect but what shall we say now captain harville if the change be not from outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature man's nature which has done the business for captain benwick,1,1,0.9501006943685444
we never shall we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some respect saying what should not be said,1,1,0.9080642616284833
yes said he very true here we separate but harville and i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am in half a minute i know you will not be sorry to be off i shall be at your service in half a minute,1,1,0.730910090457832
mrs croft left them and captain wentworth having sealed his letter with great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurried agitated air which shewed impatience to be gone anne knew not how to understand it she had the kindest good morning god bless you from captain harville but from him not a word nor a look he had passed out of the room without a look,1,1,0.9783794740726884
the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more she began not to understand a word they said and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself they could then see that she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would not stir without her for the world this was dreadful would they only have gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting and in desperation she said she would go home,1,1,0.9465742217400412
i am afraid ma'am that it is not perfectly understood pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening i am afraid there had been some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both,1,1,0.9785057527212226
oh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word captain harville has no thought but of going,1,1,0.8559647269299996
there could not be an objection there could be only the most proper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture in half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again and the other two proceeding together and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow there they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything but which had been followed by so many many years of division and estrangement there they returned again into the past more exquisitely happy perhaps in their re-union than when it had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed in a knowledge of each other's character truth and attachment more equal to act more justified in acting and there as they slowly paced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them seeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers flirting girls nor nursery-maids and children they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest all the little variations of the last week were gone through and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end,1,1,0.9195971122605309
she had not mistaken him jealousy of mr elliot had been the retarding weight the doubt the torment that had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in bath that had returned after a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do in the last four-and-twenty hours it had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks or words or actions occasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with captain harville and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings,1,1,0.9575232545542411
their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said but the concert still more that evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments the moment of her stepping forward in the octagon room to speak to him the moment of mr elliot's appearing and tearing her away and one or two subsequent moments marked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt on with energy,1,1,0.8703444040059124
to see you cried he in the midst of those who could not be my well-wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared how could i look on without agony was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done -- was it not all against me,1,1,0.8667816483448059
you should have distinguished replied anne you should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk would have been incurred and all duty violated,1,1,0.8737515475093763
no no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give i left you in this belief and yet i was determined to see you again my spirits rallied with the morning and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here,1,1,0.9056305526200963
who can be in doubt of what followed when any two young people take it into their heads to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other's ultimate comfort this may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be truth and if such parties succeed how should a captain wentworth and an anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind consciousness of right and one independent fortune between them fail of bearing down every opposition they might in fact have borne down a great deal more than they met with for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth sir walter made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned captain wentworth with five-and-twenty thousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him was no longer nobody he was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which providence had placed him and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter,1,1,0.9947695395247044
anne satisfied at a very early period of lady russell's meaning to love captain wentworth as she ought had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value there she felt her own inferiority very keenly the disproportion in their fortune was nothing it did not give her a moment's regret but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly nothing of respectability of harmony of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity she had but two friends in the world to add to his list lady russell and mrs smith to those however he was very well disposed to attach himself lady russell in spite of all her former transgressions he could now value from his heart while he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour and as for mrs smith she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently,1,1,0.9985764162531414
he did not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny he only requested me in general terms to assist them and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself he could hardly suppose i should neglect them but as he required the promise i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at the time the promise therefore was given and must be performed something must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home,1,1,0.9836314303097424
oh beyond anything great what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters even if really his sisters and as it is -- only half blood -- but you have such a generous spirit,1,0,0.38927359566309533
there is no knowing what they may expect said the lady but we are not to think of their expectations the question is what you can afford to do,1,1,0.7160458410180629
to be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds,1,1,0.8464677517989775
to be sure said she it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once but then if mrs dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in,1,1,0.9021137034265976
fifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot be worth half that purchase,1,1,0.8596705420379037
upon my word said mr dashwood i believe you are perfectly right my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described when my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then,1,1,0.9203287408995081
certainly returned mrs john dashwood but however one thing must be considered when your father and mother moved to norland though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your mother her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it,1,1,0.9607243578697614
it is enough said she to say that he is unlike fanny is enough it implies everything amiable i love him already,1,1,0.7527491068284944
like him replied her mother with a smile i feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love,1,1,0.8617484563096406
i have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love,1,1,0.537638448985894
in a few months my dear marianne said she elinor will in all probability be settled for life we shall miss her but she will be happy,1,1,0.98921556917315
marianne hardly knew what to say she would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible at length she replied,1,1,0.9677225990780747
marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth,1,1,0.9503971035095095
and you really are not engaged to him said she yet it certainly soon will happen but two advantages will proceed from this delay i shall not lose you so soon and edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity oh if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself how delightful it would be,1,1,0.950099655191313
elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from norland than immediately amongst their present acquaintance on that head therefore it was not for her to oppose her mother's intention of removing into devonshire the house too as described by sir john was on so simple a scale and the rent so uncommonly moderate as to leave her no right of objection on either point and therefore though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy though it was a removal from the vicinity of norland beyond her wishes she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence,1,1,0.9918213407534728
in a very few weeks from the day which brought sir john middleton's first letter to norland every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable mrs dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey,1,1,0.9927902476989203
with the size and furniture of the house mrs dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable yet to add and improve was a delight to her and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments as for the house itself to be sure said she it is too small for our family but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present as it is too late in the year for improvements perhaps in the spring if i have plenty of money as i dare say i shall we may think about building these parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often collected here and i have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance this with a new drawing room which may be easily added and a bed-chamber and garret above will make it a very snug little cottage i could wish the stairs were handsome but one must not expect every thing though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them i shall see how much i am before-hand with the world in the spring and we will plan our improvements accordingly,1,1,0.94852992089127
in such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord who called to welcome them to barton and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient sir john middleton was a good looking man about forty he had formerly visited at stanhill but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him his countenance was thoroughly good-humoured and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him he said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family and pressed them so cordially to dine at barton park every day till they were better settled at home that though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility they could not give offence his kindness was not confined to words for within an hour after he left them a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game he insisted moreover on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day,1,1,0.9824234004935153
lady middleton had sent a very civil message by him denoting her intention of waiting on mrs dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite her ladyship was introduced to them the next day,1,1,0.9903192117168359
mrs jennings lady middleton's mother was a good-humoured merry fat elderly woman who talked a great deal seemed very happy and rather vulgar she was full of jokes and laughter and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not marianne was vexed at it for her sister's sake and turned her eyes towards elinor to see how she bore these attacks with an earnestness which gave elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery as mrs jennings's,1,1,0.9801255938359255
there was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the dashwoods but the cold insipidity of lady middleton was so particularly repulsive that in comparison of it the gravity of colonel brandon and even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his mother-in-law was interesting lady middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner who pulled her about tore her clothes and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves,1,1,0.9697739280266913
mrs jennings was a widow with an ample jointure she had only two daughters both of whom she had lived to see respectably married and she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world in the promotion of this object she was zealously active as far as her ability reached and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance she was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at barton decisively to pronounce that colonel brandon was very much in love with marianne dashwood she rather suspected it to be so on the very first evening of their being together from his listening so attentively while she sang to them and when the visit was returned by the middletons' dining at the cottage the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again it must be so she was perfectly convinced of it it would be an excellent match for he was rich and she was handsome mrs jennings had been anxious to see colonel brandon well married ever since her connection with sir john first brought him to her knowledge and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl,1,1,0.9990662108258789
did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life,1,1,0.5241837280756627
my dearest child said her mother laughing at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty,1,0,0.40871863818433485
a woman of seven and twenty said marianne after pausing a moment can never hope to feel or inspire affection again and if her home be uncomfortable or her fortune small i can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the provision and security of a wife in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable it would be a compact of convenience and the world would be satisfied in my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be nothing to me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other,1,1,0.9635321088910718
but he talked of flannel waistcoats said marianne and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches cramps rheumatisms and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble,1,0,0.46838353042051767
soon after this upon elinor's leaving the room mamma said marianne i have an alarm on the subject of illness which i cannot conceal from you i am sure edward ferrars is not well we have now been here almost a fortnight and yet he does not come nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay what else can detain him at norland,1,1,0.9919751423878944
had you any idea of his coming so soon said mrs dashwood i had none on the contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation when i talked of his coming to barton does elinor expect him already,1,1,0.9891042913996686
i rather think you are mistaken for when i was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time,1,1,0.8746905487639886
their visitors except those from barton park were not many for in spite of sir john's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service the independence of mrs dashwood's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk there were but few who could be so classed and it was not all of them that were attainable about a mile and a half from the cottage along the narrow winding valley of allenham which issued from that of barton as formerly described the girls had in one of their earliest walks discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which by reminding them a little of norland interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it but they learnt on enquiry that its possessor an elderly lady of very good character was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world and never stirred from home,1,1,0.9902686397222475
elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person which was uncommonly handsome received additional charms from his voice and expression had he been even old ugly and vulgar the gratitude and kindness of mrs dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child but the influence of youth beauty and elegance gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings,1,1,0.9786964258671862
she thanked him again and again and with a sweetness of address which always attended her invited him to be seated but this he declined as he was dirty and wet mrs dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged his name he replied was willoughby and his present home was at allenham from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after miss dashwood the honour was readily granted and he then departed to make himself still more interesting in the midst of a heavy rain,1,1,0.9860575626562255
his manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration and the laugh which his gallantry raised against marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions -- marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest for the confusion which crimsoned over her face on his lifting her up had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house but she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others and with an energy which always adorned her praise his person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her every circumstance belonging to him was interesting his name was good his residence was in their favourite village and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming her imagination was busy her reflections were pleasant and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded,1,1,0.9482589440265969
ay you will make conquests enough i dare say one way or other poor brandon he is quite smitten already and he is very well worth setting your cap at i can tell you in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles,1,1,0.6353403987642117
marianne's preserver as margaret with more elegance than precision styled willoughby called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries he was received by mrs dashwood with more than politeness with a kindness which sir john's account of him and her own gratitude prompted and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense elegance mutual affection and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced,1,1,0.9985277575535875
it was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk she could not be silent when such points were introduced and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion they speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions she proceeded to question him on the subject of books her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works however disregarded before their taste was strikingly alike the same books the same passages were idolized by each -- or if any difference appeared any objection arose it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed he acquiesced in all her decisions caught all her enthusiasm and long before his visit concluded they conversed with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance,1,1,0.9876876399491626
elinor cried marianne is this fair is this just are my ideas so scanty but i see what you mean i have been too much at my ease too happy too frank i have erred against every common-place notion of decorum i have been open and sincere where i ought to have been reserved spiritless dull and deceitful -- had i talked only of the weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have been spared,1,1,0.9534646814292281
marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection had been rash and unjustifiable willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period as capable of attaching her and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest as his abilities were strong,1,1,0.9758763281116701
my protege as you call him is a sensible man and sense will always have attractions for me yes marianne even in a man between thirty and forty he has seen a great deal of the world has been abroad has read and has a thinking mind i have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature,1,1,0.8930115260293212
perhaps said willoughby his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs gold mohrs and palanquins,1,1,0.6101534070623841
i may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further than your candour but why should you dislike him,1,1,0.6101035715682567
little had mrs dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into devonshire that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment yet such was the case when marianne was recovered the schemes of amusement at home and abroad which sir john had been previously forming were put into execution the private balls at the park then began and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery october would allow in every meeting of the kind willoughby was included and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of marianne of marking his animated admiration of her and of receiving in her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance of her affection,1,1,0.9985068864250787
elinor could not be surprised at their attachment she only wished that it were less openly shewn and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self-command to marianne but marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions willoughby thought the same and their behaviour at all times was an illustration of their opinions,1,1,0.9904923794753985
mrs dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind,1,1,0.9851558905486164
this was the season of happiness to marianne her heart was devoted to willoughby and the fond attachment to norland which she brought with her from sussex was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home,1,1,0.9917536242866023
after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying --,1,0,0.4665682288678216
but indeed this is quite another thing i am sure they will be married very soon for he has got a lock of her hair,1,1,0.7929458348511315
this increased the mirth of the company and margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more,1,1,0.808196253720349
oh pray miss margaret let us know all about it said mrs jennings what is the gentleman's name,1,1,0.9098302494944024
to some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking considering the time of year and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight -- and mrs dashwood who had already a cold was persuaded by elinor to stay at home,1,1,0.9721350987283984
was it from avignon i hope it is not to say that your sister is worse,1,1,0.7220848853249251
but how came the hand to discompose you so much if it was only a letter of business come come this won't do colonel so let us hear the truth of it,1,0,0.46547280546043807
we must go said sir john -- it shall not be put off when we are so near it you cannot go to town till tomorrow brandon that is all,1,1,0.7526814965851356
i wish it could be so easily settled but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day,1,1,0.8281819133773287
come colonel said mrs jennings before you go do let us know what you are going about,1,1,0.7191061459492536
i can guess what his business is however said mrs jennings exultingly,1,1,0.9084583201975444
marianne coloured and replied very hastily where pray --,1,1,0.7890831190802073
marianne turned away in great confusion mrs jennings laughed heartily and elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been she had actually made her own woman enquire of mr willoughby's groom and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to allenham and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house,1,1,0.9887204905907558
she blushed at this hint but it was even visibly gratifying to her and after a ten minutes' interval of earnest thought she came to her sister again and said with great good humour perhaps elinor it was rather ill-judged in me to go to allenham but mr willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place and it is a charming house i assure you -- there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs of a nice comfortable size for constant use and with modern furniture it would be delightful it is a corner room and has windows on two sides on one side you look across the bowling-green behind the house to a beautiful hanging wood and on the other you have a view of the church and village and beyond them of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired i did not see it to advantage for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture -- but if it were newly fitted up -- a couple of hundred pounds willoughby says would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms in england,1,1,0.9588768017354042
i am heartily glad of it he cried may she always be poor if she can employ her riches no better,1,1,0.8426941588804151
with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes i suppose said elinor,1,0,0.4528615248774947
mrs dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on willoughby as plainly denoted how well she understood him,1,1,0.9736043757404629
you are a good woman he warmly replied your promise makes me easy extend it a little farther and it will make me happy tell me that not only your house will remain the same but that i shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me,1,1,0.7454351204575618
shall we see you tomorrow to dinner said mrs dashwood when he was leaving them i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady middleton,1,1,0.8952489663478052
i hope not he replied trying to look cheerful and with a forced smile presently added it is i who may rather expect to be ill -- for i am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment,1,1,0.8789671898921533
yes for i am unable to keep my engagement with you mrs smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin by sending me on business to london i have just received my dispatches and taken my farewell of allenham and by way of exhilaration i am now come to take my farewell of you,1,1,0.9120143027305498
and is mrs smith your only friend is allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome for shame willoughby can you wait for an invitation here,1,1,0.9498332414130036
i have only to add my dear willoughby that at barton cottage you will always be welcome for i will not press you to return here immediately because you only can judge how far that might be pleasing to mrs smith and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination,1,1,0.9843501730029376
he stopt mrs dashwood was too much astonished to speak and another pause succeeded this was broken by willoughby who said with a faint smile it is folly to linger in this manner i will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy,1,1,0.9338901869651447
you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered this matter as certain i have had my doubts i confess but they are fainter than they were and they may soon be entirely done away if we find they correspond every fear of mine will be removed,1,1,0.721530399531403
i hope not i believe not cried elinor i love willoughby sincerely love him and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me it has been involuntary and i will not encourage it i was startled i confess by the alteration in his manners this morning -- he did not speak like himself and did not return your kindness with any cordiality but all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed he had just parted from my sister had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for some time he should seem to act an ungenerous a suspicious part by our family be might well be embarrassed and disturbed in such a case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general character -- but i will not raise objections against any one's conduct on so illiberal a foundation as a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent,1,1,0.9946437637918182
this violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening she was without any power because she was without any desire of command over herself the slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby overpowered her in an instant and though her family were most anxiously attentive to her comfort it was impossible for them if they spoke at all to keep clear of every subject which her feelings connected with him,1,1,0.9771789305577003
why do you not ask marianne at once said she whether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby from you her mother and so kind so indulgent a mother the question could not give offence it would be the natural result of your affection for her she used to be all unreserve and to you more especially,1,1,0.9596606977608051
it was several days before willoughby's name was mentioned before marianne by any of her family sir john and mrs jennings indeed were not so nice their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour -- but one evening mrs dashwood accidentally taking up a volume of shakespeare exclaimed,1,1,0.9949158761507564
he was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being willoughby the only one who could have gained a smile from her but she dispersed her tears to smile on him and in her sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment,1,1,0.9657838470637866
no not all answered marianne we could not be more unfortunately situated,1,1,0.8539244954656654
marianne cried her sister how can you say so how can you be so unjust they are a very respectable family mr ferrars and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner have you forgot marianne how many pleasant days we have owed to them,1,1,0.9744873707367002
mrs dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him for his coming to barton was in her opinion of all things the most natural her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder he received the kindest welcome from her and shyness coldness reserve could not stand against such a reception they had begun to fail him before he entered the house and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of mrs dashwood indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters without extending the passion to her and elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself his affections seemed to reanimate towards them all and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible he was not in spirits however he praised their house admired its prospect was attentive and kind but still he was not in spirits the whole family perceived it and mrs dashwood attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents,1,1,0.9959583573382496
as moderate as those of the rest of the world i believe i wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy but like every body else it must be in my own way greatness will not make me so,1,1,0.7013236408991178
oh dear cried margaret how happy i should be i wonder what i should do with it,1,1,0.8715161804987895
i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself said mrs dashwood if my children were all to be rich my help,1,1,0.8292060355947164
i love to be reminded of the past edward -- whether it be melancholy or gay i love to recall it -- and you will never offend me by talking of former times you are very right in supposing how my money would be spent -- some of it at least -- my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books,1,1,0.8017622563828259
marianne is as steadfast as ever you see said elinor she is not at all altered,1,1,0.9010228856080914
edward started -- reserved am i reserved marianne,1,1,0.8928436542876608
i do not understand you replied he colouring reserved -- how in what manner what am i to tell you what can you suppose,1,1,0.6655309551967981
elinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend his visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect it was evident that he was unhappy she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one,1,1,0.9888467865939092
sir john never came to the dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day or to drink tea with them that evening on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their visitor towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute he wished to engage them for both,1,1,0.9224606703066889
you must drink tea with us to night said he for we shall be quite alone -- and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us for we shall be a large party,1,0,0.4474758856497471
who why yourselves and the careys and whitakers to be sure -- what you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone,1,0,0.481015001402438
i do not doubt it replied he rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general founded only on a something or a nothing between mr willoughby and herself he would not have ventured to mention it,1,1,0.9835250509361686
i do assure you he replied that i have long thought on this point as you think now it has been and is and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me that i have had no necessary business to engage me no profession to give me employment or afford me any thing like independence but unfortunately my own nicety and the nicety of my friends have made me what i am an idle helpless being we never could agree in our choice of a profession i always preferred the church as i still do but that was not smart enough for my family they recommended the army that was a great deal too smart for me the law was allowed to be genteel enough many young men who had chambers in the temple made a very good appearance in the first circles and drove about town in very knowing gigs but i had no inclination for the law even in this less abstruse study of it which my family approved as for the navy it had fashion on its side but i was too old when the subject was first started to enter it -- and at length as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all as i might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing i was therefore entered at oxford and have been properly idle ever since,1,1,0.9292655319826603
elinor was obliged to turn from her in the middle of her story to receive the rest of the party lady middleton introduced the two strangers mrs dashwood and margaret came down stairs at the same time and they all sat down to look at one another while mrs jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour attended by sir john,1,1,0.9809993495898365
sir john had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park mrs dashwood who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage absolutely refused on her own account her daughters might do as they pleased but they had no curiosity to see how mr and mrs palmer ate their dinner and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way they attempted therefore likewise to excuse themselves the weather was uncertain and not likely to be good but sir john would not be satisfied -- the carriage should be sent for them and they must come lady middleton too though she did not press their mother pressed them mrs jennings and mrs palmer joined their entreaties all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party and the young ladies were obliged to yield,1,1,0.9996191294386313
they were obliged to put an end to such an expectation,1,1,0.779587018982397
they thanked her but were obliged to resist all her entreaties,1,1,0.8927296943858425
how horrid all this is said he such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting dullness is as much produced within doors as without by rain it makes one detest all one's acquaintance what the devil does sir john mean by not having a billiard room in his house how few people know what comfort is sir john is as stupid as the weather,1,1,0.8306363786255193
did not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me about it before that it could not be done they dined with us last,1,1,0.710093712841522
i did not know i contradicted any body in calling your mother ill-bred,1,1,0.8033383542736489
there now -- said his lady you see mr palmer expects you so you cannot refuse to come,1,1,0.7343022232929967
she surprised elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room by asking her whether she did not like mr palmer excessively,1,1,0.9783114219007545
but i do assure you it was so for all that and i will tell you how it happened when we met him he turned back and walked with us and so we began talking of my brother and sister and one thing and another and i said to him 'so colonel there is a new family come to barton cottage i hear and mama sends me word they are very pretty and that one of them is going to be married to mr willoughby of combe magna is it true pray for of course you must know as you have been in devonshire so lately ',1,1,0.9615276533301758
i am flattered by his commendation he seems an excellent man and i think him uncommonly pleasing,1,1,0.6966712240605304
so do i -- he is such a charming man that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull mamma says he was in love with your sister too -- i assure you it was a great compliment if he was for he hardly ever falls in love with any body,1,1,0.8563279050861637
you have been long acquainted with colonel brandon have not you,1,1,0.9316794750562403
what a sweet woman lady middleton is said lucy steele,1,1,0.9359481120732556
here too miss dashwood's commendation being only simple and just came in without any eclat she merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly,1,1,0.9187607999888993
i should guess so said elinor with a smile from what i have witnessed this morning,1,1,0.8455335355784582
in some surprise at the familiarity of this question or at least of the manner in which it was spoken elinor replied that she was,1,1,0.8462509510353898
norland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it added miss steele,1,1,0.8601881497854643
we have heard sir john admire it excessively said lucy who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister,1,1,0.9414441812284232
oh dear one never thinks of married men's being beaux -- they have something else to do,1,1,0.846483853120984
this specimen of the miss steeles was enough the vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation and as elinor was not blinded by the beauty or the shrewd look of the youngest to her want of real elegance and artlessness she left the house without any wish of knowing them better,1,1,0.9497339713524129
to do him justice he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve by making the miss steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins' situations in the most delicate particulars -- and elinor had not seen them more than twice before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to barton,1,1,0.9942482779522221
his name is ferrars said he in a very audible whisper but pray do not tell it for it's a great secret,1,1,0.6241010000795113
lucy was naturally clever her remarks were often just and amusing and as a companion for half an hour elinor frequently found her agreeable but her powers had received no aid from education she was ignorant and illiterate and her deficiency of all mental improvement her want of information in the most common particulars could not be concealed from miss dashwood in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage elinor saw and pitied her for the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable but she saw with less tenderness of feeling the thorough want of delicacy of rectitude and integrity of mind which her attentions her assiduities her flatteries at the park betrayed and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality and whose conduct toward others made every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless,1,1,0.9980803936305156
indeed replied lucy i wonder at that for i thought you must have seen her at norland sometimes then perhaps you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is,1,1,0.9109241516147811
you are quite in the right replied elinor calmly they then proceeded a few paces in silence lucy spoke first,1,1,0.7337821720926928
to be sure continued lucy after a few minutes silence on both sides his mother must provide for him sometime or other but poor edward is so cast down by it did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at barton he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple to go to you that i was afraid you would think him quite ill,1,1,0.8989295149217812
did not you think him sadly out of spirits repeated lucy,1,1,0.7544275555890058
i begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter but it made him so melancholy not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us and seeing me so much affected -- poor fellow -- i am afraid it is just the same with him now for he writes in wretched spirits i heard from him just before i left exeter taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to elinor you know his hand i dare say a charming one it is but that is not written so well as usual -- he was tired i dare say for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible,1,1,0.9473681945013799
at this point in the first and second editions volume 1 ends,1,0,0.24475340039938281
however small elinor's general dependence on lucy's veracity might be it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description what lucy had asserted to be true therefore elinor could not dared not longer doubt supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of mr pratt was a foundation for the rest at once indisputable and alarming and edward's visit near plymouth his melancholy state of mind his dissatisfaction at his own prospects his uncertain behaviour towards herself the intimate knowledge of the miss steeles as to norland and their family connections which had often surprised her the picture the letter the ring formed altogether such a body of evidence as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly and established as a fact which no partiality could set aside his ill-treatment of herself -- her resentment of such behaviour her indignation at having been its dupe for a short time made her feel only for herself but other ideas other considerations soon arose had edward been intentionally deceiving her had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel was his engagement to lucy an engagement of the heart no whatever it might once have been she could not believe it such at present his affection was all her own she could not be deceived in that her mother sisters fanny all had been conscious of his regard for her at norland it was not an illusion of her own vanity he certainly loved her what a softener of the heart was this persuasion how much could it not tempt her to forgive he had been blamable highly blamable in remaining at norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be in that he could not be defended but if he had injured her how much more had he injured himself if her case were pitiable his was hopeless his imprudence had made her miserable for a while but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise she might in time regain tranquillity but he what had he to look forward to could he ever be tolerably happy with lucy steele could he were his affection for herself out of the question with his integrity his delicacy and well-informed mind be satisfied with a wife like her -- illiterate artful and selfish,1,1,0.9996766398108714
but it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be commanded though lucy was as well disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred for the weather was not often fine enough to allow of their joining in a walk where they might most easily separate themselves from the others and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or cottage and chiefly at the former they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation such a thought would never enter either sir john or lady middleton's head and therefore very little leisure was ever given for a general chat and none at all for particular discourse they met for the sake of eating drinking and laughing together playing at cards or consequences or any other game that was sufficiently noisy,1,1,0.9843062502178528
perhaps continued elinor if i should happen to cut out i may be of some use to miss lucy steele in rolling her papers for her and there is so much still to be done to the basket that it must be impossible i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening i should like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it,1,1,0.9335643699442282
thank you cried lucy warmly for breaking the ice you have set my heart at ease by it for i was somehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i told you that monday,1,1,0.6512219123064298
indeed i can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you to acknowledge your situation to me and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it your case is a very unfortunate one you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them mr ferrars i believe is entirely dependent on his mother,1,1,0.9589434644652909
but mrs john dashwood would not much approve of edward's going into orders,1,1,0.9834275244787477
i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement we seem so beset with difficulties on every side that though it would make us miserable for a time we should be happier perhaps in the end but you will not give me your advice miss dashwood,1,1,0.941501208481785
mrs dashwood smiled and said nothing marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment and elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue,1,1,0.9208044139221868
after very little farther discourse it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted mrs jennings received the information with a great deal of joy and many assurances of kindness and care nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her sir john was delighted for to a man whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone the acquisition of two to the number of inhabitants in london was something even lady middleton took the trouble of being delighted which was putting herself rather out of her way and as for the miss steeles especially lucy they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them,1,1,0.9946225812592783
their departure took place in the first week in january the middletons were to follow in about a week the miss steeles kept their station at the park and were to quit it only with the rest of the family,1,1,0.865267308726368
the house was handsome and handsomely fitted up and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment it had formerly been charlotte's and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect,1,1,0.9521127376509698
i am not going to write to my mother replied marianne hastily and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry elinor said no more it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to willoughby and the conclusion which as instantly followed was that however mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair they must be engaged this conviction though not entirely satisfactory gave her pleasure and she continued her letter with greater alacrity marianne's was finished in a very few minutes in length it could be no more than a note it was then folded up sealed and directed with eager rapidity elinor thought she could distinguish a large w in the direction and no sooner was it complete than marianne ringing the bell requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post this decided the matter at once,1,1,0.9945403380855861
elinor answered in some distress that she was and then talked of head-aches low spirits and over fatigues and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sister's behaviour,1,1,0.9417964354143274
after her entrance colonel brandon became more thoughtful and silent than he had been before and mrs jennings could not prevail on him to stay long no other visitor appeared that evening and the ladies were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed,1,1,0.9734687236515935
wherever they went she was evidently always on the watch in bond street especially where much of their business lay her eyes were in constant inquiry and in whatever shop the party were engaged her mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them from all that interested and occupied the others restless and dissatisfied every where her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase however it might equally concern them both she received no pleasure from anything was only impatient to be at home again and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of mrs palmer whose eye was caught by every thing pretty expensive or new who was wild to buy all could determine on none and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision,1,1,0.9770944154901714
has no letter been left here for me since we went out said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels she was answered in the negative are you quite sure of it she replied are you certain that no servant no porter has left any letter or note,1,1,0.6334832933804492
she determined after some consideration that if appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were she would represent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the affair,1,1,0.9268543643339348
don't you find it colder than it was in the morning elinor there seems to me a very decided difference i can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff it was not so yesterday i think the clouds seem parting too the sun will be out in a moment and we shall have a clear afternoon,1,1,0.5546432872459504
colonel brandon who had a general invitation to the house was with them almost every day he came to look at marianne and talk to elinor who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister she feared it was a strengthening regard it grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched marianne and his spirits were certainly worse than when at barton,1,1,0.9921357615922167
this event while it raised the spirits of elinor restored to those of her sister all and more than all their former agitation from this moment her mind was never quiet the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day made her unfit for any thing she insisted on being left behind the next morning when the others went out,1,1,0.9767463305788361
elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing in berkeley street during their absence but a moment's glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her that willoughby had paid no second visit there a note was just then brought in and laid on the table,1,1,0.9519437286331903
elinor distressed by this charge of reserve in herself which she was not at liberty to do away knew not how under such circumstances to press for greater openness in marianne,1,1,0.9632667347591042
mrs jennings soon appeared and the note being given her she read it aloud it was from lady middleton announcing their arrival in conduit street the night before and requesting the company of her mother and cousins the following evening business on sir john's part and a violent cold on her own prevented their calling in berkeley street the invitation was accepted but when the hour of appointment drew near necessary as it was in common civility to mrs jennings that they should both attend her on such a visit elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go for still she had seen nothing of willoughby and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence,1,1,0.9982953296699636
aye aye said mrs jennings we know the reason of all that very well if a certain person who shall be nameless had been there you would not have been a bit tired and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited,1,1,0.8971458595057735
so my daughter middleton told me for it seems sir john met him somewhere in the street this morning marianne said no more but looked exceedingly hurt impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister's relief elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of marianne to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow that marianne was again writing to willoughby for she could not suppose it to be to any other person,1,1,0.9946718664984863
they arrived in due time at the place of destination and as soon as the string of carriages before them would allow alighted ascended the stairs heard their names announced from one landing-place to another in an audible voice and entered a room splendidly lit up quite full of company and insufferably hot when they had paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house they were permitted to mingle in the crowd and take their share of the heat and inconvenience to which their arrival must necessarily add after some time spent in saying little or doing less lady middleton sat down to cassino and as marianne was not in spirits for moving about she and elinor luckily succeeding to chairs placed themselves at no great distance from the table,1,1,0.9121431397177885
good heavens she exclaimed he is there -- he is there -- oh why does he not look at me why cannot i speak to him,1,0,0.41492978224716287
but have you not received my notes cried marianne in the wildest anxiety here is some mistake i am sure -- some dreadful mistake what can be the meaning of it tell me willoughby for heaven's sake tell me what is the matter,1,1,0.7492759759547842
he made no reply his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned but as if on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking he felt the necessity of instant exertion he recovered himself again and after saying yes i had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so good as to send me turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined his friend,1,1,0.9179827063146048
with difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself and to persuade her to check her agitation to wait at least with the appearance of composure till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect was impossible for marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings by exclamations of wretchedness in a short time elinor saw willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase and telling marianne that he was gone urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening as a fresh argument for her to be calm she instantly begged her sister would entreat lady middleton to take them home as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer,1,1,0.9954994023959411
for shame for shame miss dashwood how can you talk so don't we all know that it must be a match that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met did not i see them together in devonshire every day and all day long and did not i know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes come come this won't do because you are so sly about it yourself you think nobody else has any senses but it is no such thing i can tell you for it has been known all over town this ever so long i tell every body of it and so does charlotte,1,1,0.7746818970426975
mrs jennings laughed again but elinor had not spirits to say more and eager at all events to know what willoughby had written hurried away to their room where on opening the door she saw marianne stretched on the bed almost choked by grief one letter in her hand and two or three others laying by her elinor drew near but without saying a word and seating herself on the bed took her hand kissed her affectionately several times and then gave way to a burst of tears which at first was scarcely less violent than marianne's the latter though unable to speak seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour and after some time thus spent in joint affliction she put all the letters into elinor's hands and then covering her face with her handkerchief almost screamed with agony elinor who knew that such grief shocking as it was to witness it must have its course watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself and then turning eagerly to willoughby's letter read as follows,1,1,0.9892846930334918
do you call me happy marianne ah if you knew -- and can you believe me to be so while i see you so wretched,1,1,0.7787057445540895
no no no cried marianne wildly he loves you and only you you can have no grief,1,1,0.6931398345555314
yes -- no -- never absolutely it was every day implied but never professedly declared sometimes i thought it had been -- but it never was,1,1,0.8612101350258327
dearest marianne who but himself by whom can he have been instigated,1,1,0.8839740094868452
by all the world rather than by his own heart i could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion than believe his nature capable of such cruelty this woman of whom he writes -- whoever she be -- or any one in short but your own dear self mama and edward may have been so barbarous to bely me beyond you three is there a creature in the world whom i would not rather suspect of evil than willoughby whose heart i know so well,1,1,0.9510059097477062
mrs jennings came immediately to their room on her return and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern,1,1,0.895246725218643
how do you do my dear -- said she in a voice of great compassion to marianne who turned away her face without attempting to answer,1,1,0.8300641913528246
elinor who did justice to mrs jennings's kindness though its effusions were often distressing and sometimes almost ridiculous made her those acknowledgments and returned her those civilities which her sister could not make or return for herself their good friend saw that marianne was unhappy and felt that every thing was due to her which might make her at all less so she treated her therefore with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its holidays marianne was to have the best place by the fire was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day had not elinor in the sad countenance of her sister seen a check to all mirth she could have been entertained by mrs jennings's endeavours to cure a disappointment in love by a variety of sweetmeats and olives and a good fire as soon however as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on marianne she could stay no longer with a hasty exclamation of misery and a sign to her sister not to follow her she directly got up and hurried out of the room,1,1,0.9977971427533355
the lady then -- miss grey i think you called her -- is very rich,1,1,0.6591067594866291
her guardians my dear but now she is of age and may choose for herself and a pretty choice she has made -- what now after pausing a moment -- your poor sister is gone to her own room i suppose to moan by herself is there nothing one can get to comfort her poor dear it seems quite cruel to let her be alone well by-and-by we shall have a few friends and that will amuse her a little what shall we play at she hates whist i know but is there no round game she cares for,1,1,0.8701361392594849
in this affair it can only do harm more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind for it has been attended by circumstances which for the sake of every one concerned in it make it unfit to become the public conversation i must do this justice to mr willoughby -- he has broken no positive engagement with my sister,1,1,0.9569548326063201
ay if we can do that ma'am said elinor we shall do very well with or without colonel brandon and then rising she went away to join marianne whom she found as she expected in her own room leaning in silent misery over the small remains of a fire which till elinor's entrance had been her only light,1,1,0.9558224857106733
in the drawing-room whither she then repaired she was soon joined by mrs jennings with a wine-glass full of something in her hand,1,1,0.7987729866493637
colonel brandon came in while the party were at tea and by his manner of looking round the room for marianne elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see her there and in short that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence mrs jennings was not struck by the same thought for soon after his entrance she walked across the room to the tea-table where elinor presided and whispered -- the colonel looks as grave as ever you see he knows nothing of it do tell him my dear,1,1,0.9842095796305798
that a gentleman whom i had reason to think -- in short that a man whom i knew to be engaged -- but how shall i tell you if you know it already as surely you must i may be spared,1,1,0.6902472114059051
her sufferings have been very severe i have only to hope that they may be proportionately short it has been it is a most cruel affliction till yesterday i believe she never doubted his regard and even now perhaps -- but i am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her he has been very deceitful and in some points there seems a hardness of heart about him,1,1,0.959755712906717
he made no answer and soon afterwards by the removal of the tea-things and the arrangement of the card parties the subject was necessarily dropped mrs jennings who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking and who expected to see the effect of miss dashwood's communication in such an instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandon's side as might have become a man in the bloom of youth of hope and happiness saw him with amazement remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual,1,1,0.980717282539623
the cruelty of mrs jennings no language within her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence could have expressed and now she could reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence -- a reproach however so entirely lost on its object that after many expressions of pity she withdrew still referring her to the letter of comfort but the letter when she was calm enough to read it brought little comfort willoughby filled every page her mother still confident of their engagement and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy had only been roused by elinor's application to intreat from marianne greater openness towards them both and this with such tenderness towards her such affection for willoughby and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other that she wept with agony through the whole of it,1,1,0.9953419862913173
all her impatience to be at home again now returned her mother was dearer to her than ever dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in willoughby and she was wildly urgent to be gone elinor unable herself to determine whether it were better for marianne to be in london or at barton offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known and at length she obtained her sister's consent to wait for that knowledge,1,1,0.9933380486025069
he will not come in as mrs jennings is from home,1,1,0.941315677978641
indeed answered elinor i have not forgotten it he looked pleased by this remembrance and added,1,1,0.8419592912148268
he could say no more and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room elinor affected by his relation and still more by his distress could not speak he saw her concern and coming to her took her hand pressed it and kissed it with grateful respect a few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure,1,1,0.9630163488255418
again he stopped to recover himself and elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern at the fate of his unfortunate friend,1,1,0.9099941767970621
such said colonel brandon after a pause has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust,1,1,0.8454973745159879
to give the feelings or the language of mrs dashwood on receiving and answering elinor's letter would be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said of a disappointment hardly less painful than marianne's and an indignation even greater than elinor's long letters from her quickly succeeding each other arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought to express her anxious solicitude for marianne and entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune bad indeed must the nature of marianne's affliction be when her mother could talk of fortitude mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets which she could wish her not to indulge,1,1,0.998617443894245
but it was a matter of great consolation to her that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister and elinor on the other hand suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid edward entirely comforted herself by thinking that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness it would be better for marianne than an immediate return into devonshire,1,1,0.9925432415690832
she received the news with resolute composure made no observation on it and at first shed no tears but after a short time they would burst out and for the rest of the day she was in a state hardly less pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event,1,1,0.8770401054861885
the willoughbys left town as soon as they were married and elinor now hoped as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them to prevail on her sister who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell to go out again by degrees as she had done before,1,1,0.9475452255774798
not in the stage i assure you replied miss steele with quick exultation we came post all the way and had a very smart beau to attend us dr davies was coming to town and so we thought we'd join him in a post-chaise and he behaved very genteelly and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did,1,1,0.8455470473546479
there now said miss steele affectedly simpering everybody laughs at me so about the doctor and i cannot think why my cousins say they are sure i have made a conquest but for my part i declare i never think about him from one hour's end to another 'lord here comes your beau nancy ' my cousin said t'other day when she saw him crossing the street to the house my beau indeed said i -- i cannot think who you mean the doctor is no beau of mine,1,1,0.6439805219785599
oh if that's all cried miss steele we can just as well go and see her,1,1,0.7678047678401965
elinor found that he and fanny had been in town two days,1,1,0.9403223078729785
after staying with them half an hour he asked elinor to walk with him to conduit street and introduce him to sir john and lady middleton the weather was remarkably fine and she readily consented as soon as they were out of the house his enquiries began,1,1,0.9736892401640725
more than you think it really and intrinsically worth,1,1,0.5279979336646577
certainly said elinor and assisted by her liberality i hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances,1,1,0.9442151439100399
the same manners however which recommended mrs john dashwood to the good opinion of lady middleton did not suit the fancy of mrs jennings and to her she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address who met her husband's sisters without any affection and almost without having anything to say to them for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on berkeley street she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence,1,1,0.9952855690313462
the dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the middletons that though not much in the habit of giving anything they determined to give them -- a dinner and soon after their acquaintance began invited them to dine in harley street where they had taken a very good house for three months their sisters and mrs jennings were invited likewise and john dashwood was careful to secure colonel brandon who always glad to be where the miss dashwoods were received his eager civilities with some surprise but much more pleasure they were to meet mrs ferrars but elinor could not learn whether her sons were to be of the party the expectation of seeing her however was enough to make her interested in the engagement for though she could now meet edward's mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself her desire of being in company with mrs ferrars her curiosity to know what she was like was as lively as ever,1,1,0.9997510938697272
the interest with which she thus anticipated the party was soon afterwards increased more powerfully than pleasantly by her hearing that the miss steeles were also to be at it,1,1,0.936357973306463
these apprehensions perhaps were not founded entirely on reason and certainly not at all on truth they were relieved however not by her own recollection but by the good will of lucy who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that edward certainly would not be in harley street on tuesday and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme affection for herself which he could not conceal when they were together,1,1,0.9873902492940042
mrs ferrars was a little thin woman upright even to formality in her figure and serious even to sourness in her aspect her complexion was sallow and her features small without beauty and naturally without expression but a lucky contraction of the brow had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature she was not a woman of many words for unlike people in general she proportioned them to the number of her ideas and of the few syllables that did escape her not one fell to the share of miss dashwood whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events,1,1,0.9314454468199836
when the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner this poverty was particularly evident for the gentlemen had supplied the discourse with some variety -- the variety of politics inclosing land and breaking horses -- but then it was all over and one subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in which was the comparative heights of harry dashwood and lady middleton's second son william who were nearly of the same age,1,1,0.8834986460672754
these are done by my eldest sister said he and you as a man of taste will i dare say be pleased with them i do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well,1,1,0.9133986779060393
perhaps fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough -- for colouring a little she immediately said,1,1,0.8842356360825215
mrs ferrars looked exceedingly angry and drawing herself up more stiffly than ever pronounced in retort this bitter philippic miss morton is lord morton's daughter,1,1,0.9095273145340345
fanny looked very angry too and her husband was all in a fright at his sister's audacity elinor was much more hurt by marianne's warmth than she had been by what produced it but colonel brandon's eyes as they were fixed on marianne declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point,1,1,0.9920534714912169
she wondered that lucy's spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of mrs ferrars -- that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was not elinor appear a compliment to herself -- or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her because her real situation was unknown but that it was so had not only been declared by lucy's eyes at the time but was declared over again the next morning more openly for at her particular desire lady middleton set her down in berkeley street on the chance of seeing elinor alone to tell her how happy she was,1,1,0.9980880584549316
to this elinor had no answer to make and did not attempt any,1,1,0.8902097416198123
i am sure i should have seen it in a moment if mrs ferrars had took a dislike to me if she had only made me a formal courtesy for instance without saying a word and never after had took any notice of me and never looked at me in a pleasant way -- you know what i mean -- if i had been treated in that forbidding sort of way i should have gave it all up in despair i could not have stood it for where she does dislike i know it is most violent,1,1,0.8415934469845503
but elinor had more to do and so anxious was she for his sake and her own to do it well that she forced herself after a moment's recollection to welcome him with a look and manner that were almost easy and almost open and another struggle another effort still improved them she would not allow the presence of lucy nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him and that she had very much regretted being from home when he called before in berkeley street she would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which as a friend and almost a relation were his due by the observant eyes of lucy though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her,1,1,0.9925953332604853
we spent such a day edward in harley street yesterday so dull so wretchedly dull -- but i have much to say to you on that head which cannot be said now,1,1,0.7769969425072936
not so indeed for seriously speaking i am very sure that conscience only kept edward from harley street and i really believe he has the most delicate conscience in the world the most scrupulous in performing every engagement however minute and however it may make against his interest or pleasure he is the most fearful of giving pain of wounding expectation and the most incapable of being selfish of any body i ever saw edward it is so and i will say it what are you never to hear yourself praised -- then you must be no friend of mine for those who will accept of my love and esteem must submit to my open commendation,1,1,0.9587683865373727
why so -- we were all his friends and lucy has been the longest known to him of any it is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves,1,1,0.7945377528640191
this event highly important to mrs jennings's happiness produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time and influenced in a like degree the engagements of her young friends for as she wished to be as much as possible with charlotte she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed and did not return till late in the evening and the miss dashwoods at the particular request of the middletons spent the whole of every day in every day in conduit street for their own comfort they would much rather have remained at least all the morning in mrs jennings's house but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody their hours were therefore made over to lady middleton and the two miss steeles by whom their company in fact was as little valued as it was professedly sought,1,1,0.9979408362702313
their presence was a restraint both on her and on lucy it checked the idleness of one and the business of the other lady middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them and the flattery which lucy was proud to think of and administer at other times she feared they would despise her for offering miss steele was the least discomposed of the three by their presence and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between marianne and mr willoughby she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner which their arrival occasioned but this conciliation was not granted for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to elinor and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before marianne no effect was produced but a look of indifference from the former or of disgust in the latter an effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend would they only have laughed at her about the doctor but so little were they anymore than the others inclined to oblige her that if sir john dined from home she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself,1,1,0.9951349824739691
with such encouragement as this was she dismissed on the present occasion to her brother's carriage which they were ready to enter five minutes after it stopped at the door a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister-in-law who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman,1,1,0.979343133853154
elinor set him right as to its situation and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody could live in devonshire without living near dawlish he bestowed his hearty approbation however on their species of house,1,1,0.9150758806815735
for my own part said he i am excessively fond of a cottage there is always so much comfort so much elegance about them and i protest if i had any money to spare i should buy a little land and build one myself within a short distance of london where i might drive myself down at any time and collect a few friends about me and be happy i advise every body who is going to build to build a cottage my friend lord courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice and laid before me three different plans of bonomi's i was to decide on the best of them 'my dear courtland ' said i immediately throwing them all into the fire 'do not adopt either of them but by all means build a cottage ' and that i fancy will be the end of it,1,1,0.8450752442497217
her husband but with great humility did not see the force of her objection they had already spent a week in this manner in conduit street and lady middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations,1,1,0.9529321998838652
here mrs jennings ceased and as elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts she was able to give such an answer and make such observations as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it that mrs jennings as she had of late often hoped might be the case had ceased to imagine her at all attached to edward and happy above all the rest in the absence of marianne she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment and to give her judgment as she believed with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it,1,1,0.9984332017591077
elinor's office was a painful one -- she was going to remove what she really believed to be her sister's chief consolation -- to give such particulars of edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion -and to make marianne by a resemblance in their situations which to her fancy would seem strong feel all her own disappointment over again but unwelcome as such a task must be it was necessary to be done and elinor therefore hastened to perform it,1,1,0.9959193958123681
she was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings or to represent herself as suffering much any otherwise than as the self-command she had practised since her first knowledge of edward's engagement might suggest a hint of what was practicable to marianne her narration was clear and simple and though it could not be given without emotion it was not accompanied by violent agitation nor impetuous grief -- that belonged rather to the hearer for marianne listened with horror and cried excessively elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses no less than in theirs and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind and a very earnest vindication of edward from every charge but of imprudence was readily offered,1,1,0.9967949527416545
but marianne for some time would give credit to neither edward seemed a second willoughby and acknowledging as elinor did that she had loved him most sincerely could she feel less than herself as for lucy steele she considered her so totally unamiable so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man that she could not be persuaded at first to believe and afterwards to pardon any former affection of edward for her she would not even admit it to have been natural and elinor left her to be convinced that it was so by that which only could convince her a better knowledge of mankind,1,1,0.9990190747997597
how long has this been known to you elinor has he written to you,1,1,0.7946603934248859
four months -- have you known of this four months,1,1,0.753900753601202
what -- while attending me in all my misery has this been on your heart -- and i have reproached you for being happy --,1,1,0.832843612924178
i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother added elinor and once or twice i have attempted it -- but without betraying my trust i never could have convinced you,1,1,0.9391008792717951
yes but i did not love only him -- and while the comfort of others was dear to me i was glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt now i can think and speak of it with little emotion i would not have you suffer on my account for i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself i have many things to support me i am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own i have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther i acquit edward of essential misconduct i wish him very happy and i am so sure of his always doing his duty that though now he may harbour some regret in the end he must become so lucy does not want sense and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built -- and after all marianne after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment and all that can be said of one's happiness depending entirely on any particular person it is not meant -- it is not fit -- it is not possible that it should be so -- edward will marry lucy he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to her --,1,1,0.9961110135885051
oh elinor she cried you have made me hate myself for ever -- how barbarous have i been to you -- you who have been my only comfort who have borne with me in all my misery who have seemed to be only suffering for me -- is this my gratitude -- is this the only return i can make you -- because your merit cries out upon myself i have been trying to do it away,1,1,0.8134298978813799
the tenderest caresses followed this confession in such a frame of mind as she was now in elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required and at her request marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness -- to meet lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her -- and even to see edward himself if chance should bring them together without any diminution of her usual cordiality -- these were great concessions -- but where marianne felt that she had injured no reparation could be too much for her to make,1,1,0.9912787771167901
they all looked their assent it seemed too awful a moment for speech,1,0,0.2901171219879688
here he stopped to be thanked which being done he went on,1,1,0.6037603636796498
marianne was going to retort but she remembered her promises and forbore,1,1,0.7748041328017332
then cried mrs jennings with blunt sincerity no longer able to be silent he has acted like an honest man i beg your pardon mr dashwood but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him a rascal i have some little concern in the business as well as yourself for lucy steele is my cousin and i believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one who more deserves a good husband,1,1,0.9581291197970458
if he would only have done as well by himself said john dashwood as all his friends were disposed to do by him he might now have been in his proper situation and would have wanted for nothing but as it is it must be out of anybody's power to assist him and there is one thing more preparing against him which must be worse than all -- his mother has determined with a very natural kind of spirit to settle that estate upon robert immediately which might have been edward's on proper conditions i left her this morning with her lawyer talking over the business,1,1,0.9900129822522271
mrs jennings was very warm in her praise of edward's conduct but only elinor and marianne understood its true merit they only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient and how small was the consolation beyond the consciousness of doing right that could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune elinor gloried in his integrity and marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his punishment but though confidence between them was by this public discovery restored to its proper state it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone elinor avoided it upon principle as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts by the too warm too positive assurances of marianne that belief of edward's continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away and marianne's courage soon failed her in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever by the comparison it necessarily produced between elinor's conduct and her own,1,1,0.9991007085912488
i never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before i assure you said elinor,1,1,0.8948736967313121
i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them said elinor you were all in the same room together were not you,1,1,0.6294540136730528
wait for his having a living -- ay we all know how that will end -- they will wait a twelvemonth and finding no good comes of it will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year with the interest of his two thousand pounds and what little matter mr steele and mr pratt can give her -- then they will have a child every year and lord help 'em how poor they will be -- i must see what i can give them towards furnishing their house two maids and two men indeed -- as i talked of t'other day -- no no they must get a stout girl of all works -- betty's sister would never do for them now,1,1,0.8574335318507474
you forget said elinor gently that its situation is not that it is not in the neighbourhood of,1,1,0.7620469979611398
i have heard said he with great compassion of the injustice your friend mr ferrars has suffered from his family for if i understand the matter right he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman -- have i been rightly informed -- is it so --,1,1,0.9355569728007617
this little rectory can do no more than make mr ferrars comfortable as a bachelor it cannot enable him to marry i am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this and my interest is hardly more extensive if however by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther i must think very differently of him from what i now do if i am not as ready to be useful to him then as i sincerely wish i could be at present what i am now doing indeed seems nothing at all since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal his only object of happiness his marriage must still be a distant good -- at least i am afraid it cannot take place very soon --,1,1,0.9639029762173857
lord my dear you are very modest i an't the least astonished at it in the world for i have often thought of late there was nothing more likely to happen,1,1,0.6815065764018686
well my dear i must be gone before i have had half my talk out but however we may have it all over in the evening for we shall be quite alone i do not ask you to go with me for i dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company and besides you must long to tell your sister all about it,1,1,0.7433515865272345
marianne had left the room before the conversation began,1,1,0.8608982118927546
oh very well said mrs jennings rather disappointed then you would not have me tell it to lucy for i think of going as far as holborn to-day,1,1,0.955021113306333
and away she went but returning again in a moment,1,1,0.5254040253550817
no replied be with sudden consciousness not to find it in you for i cannot be ignorant that to you to your goodness i owe it all -- i feel it -- i would express it if i could -- but as you well know i am no orator,1,1,0.7796956218392355
edward made no answer but when she had turned away her head gave her a look so serious so earnest so uncheerful as seemed to say that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion-house much greater,1,1,0.9143241678384655
well my dear she cried i sent you up to the young man did not i do right -- and i suppose you had no great difficulty -- you did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal,1,1,0.7689307881041656
well and how soon will he be ready -- for it seems all to depend upon that,1,1,0.7725448646552051
really said elinor i know so little of these kind of forms that i can hardly even conjecture as to the time or the preparation necessary but i suppose two or three months will complete his ordination,1,1,0.7735144255077665
my dear ma'am said elinor what can you be thinking of -- why colonel brandon's only object is to be of use to mr ferrars,1,1,0.9809231691929681
i am not sorry to see you alone he replied for i have a good deal to say to you this living of colonel brandon's -- can it be true -- has he really given it to edward -- i heard it yesterday by chance and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it,1,1,0.916727648581385
mrs ferrars added he lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject knows nothing about it at present and i believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be -- when the marriage takes place i fear she must hear of it all,1,1,0.8830092571854241
but why should such precaution be used -- though it is not to be supposed that mrs ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon -- for that must be quite out of the question yet why upon her late behaviour is she supposed to feel at all -- she has done with her son she cast him off for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise surely after doing so she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account -- she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him -- she would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child and yet retain the anxiety of a parent,1,1,0.9538404381499535
elinor said no more and john was also for a short time silent -- his reflections ended thus,1,1,0.8178182706791399
of one thing my dear sister kindly taking her hand and speaking in an awful whisper -- i may assure you -- and i will do it because i know it must gratify you i have good reason to think -- indeed i have it from the best authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it -- but i have it from the very best authority -- not that i ever precisely heard mrs ferrars say it herself -- but her daughter did and i have it from her -- that in short whatever objections there might be against a certain -- a certain connection -- you understand me -- it would have been far preferable to her it would not have given her half the vexation that this does i was exceedingly pleased to hear that mrs ferrars considered it in that light -- a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all 'it would have been beyond comparison ' she said 'the least evil of the two and she would be glad to compound now for nothing worse ' but however all that is quite out of the question -- not to be thought of or mentioned -- as to any attachment you know -- it never could be -- all that is gone by but i thought i would just tell you of this because i knew how much it must please you not that you have any reason to regret my dear elinor there is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well -- quite as well or better perhaps all things considered has colonel brandon been with you lately,1,1,0.9908407856606773
very early in april and tolerably early in the day the two parties from hanover square and berkeley street set out from their respective homes to meet by appointment on the road for the convenience of charlotte and her child they were to be more than two days on their journey and mr palmer travelling more expeditiously with colonel brandon was to join them at cleveland soon after their arrival,1,1,0.9555708010260234
she returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house on an excursion through its more immediate premises and the rest of the morning was easily whiled away in lounging round the kitchen garden examining the bloom upon its walls and listening to the gardener's lamentations upon blights in dawdling through the green-house where the loss of her favourite plants unwarily exposed and nipped by the lingering frost raised the laughter of charlotte -- and in visiting her poultry-yard where in the disappointed hopes of her dairy-maid by hens forsaking their nests or being stolen by a fox or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood she found fresh sources of merriment,1,1,0.6969327273830944
the two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner affording a pleasant enlargement of the party and a very welcome variety to their conversation which a long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low,1,1,0.8407276212283571
a very restless and feverish night however disappointed the expectation of both and when marianne after persisting in rising confessed herself unable to sit up and returned voluntarily to her bed elinor was very ready to adopt mrs jennings's advice of sending for the palmers' apothecary,1,1,0.9842869295143697
poor marianne languid and low from the nature of her malady and feeling herself universally ill could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced but for this unlucky illness made every ailment severe for on that day they were to have begun their journey home and attended the whole way by a servant of mrs jennings were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon the little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay though elinor tried to raise her spirits and make her believe as she then really believed herself that it would be a very short one,1,1,0.9904802074076678
not yet cried the other concealing her terror and assisting marianne to lie down again but she will be here i hope before it is long it is a great way you know from hence to barton,1,1,0.6656943889119625
it was no time for hesitation her fears and her difficulties were immediately before him her fears he had no courage no confidence to attempt the removal of -- he listened to them in silent despondence -- but her difficulties were instantly obviated for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion and the service pre-arranged in his mind he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch mrs dashwood elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome she thanked him with brief though fervent gratitude and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to mr harris and an order for post-horses directly she wrote a few lines to her mother,1,1,0.9884085304811786
marianne was in every respect materially better and he declared her entirely out of danger mrs jennings perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm allowed herself to trust in his judgment and admitted with unfeigned joy and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness the probability of an entire recovery,1,1,0.9886782640536187
the time was now drawing on when colonel brandon might be expected back at ten o'clock she trusted or at least not much later her mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be travelling towards them the colonel too -- perhaps scarcely less an object of pity -- oh -- how slow was the progress of time which yet kept them in ignorance,1,1,0.9398799857354565
the clock struck eight had it been ten elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house and so strong was the persuasion that she did in spite of the almost impossibility of their being already come that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter to be satisfied of the truth she instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her the flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view by their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn by four horses and this while it told the excess of her poor mother's alarm gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity,1,1,0.9580813819882361
no sir she replied with firmness i shall not stay your business cannot be with me the servants i suppose forgot to tell you that mr palmer was not in the house,1,1,0.8567866765824094
your sister said he with abruptness a moment afterwards -- is out of danger i heard it from the servant god be praised -- but is it true is it really true,1,1,0.5661895132303806
elinor would not speak he repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness,1,1,0.8275700190753417
had i known as much half an hour ago -- but since i am here -- speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat -- what does it signify -- for once miss dashwood -- it will be the last time perhaps -- let us be cheerful together -- i am in a fine mood for gaiety -- tell me honestly -- a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks -- do you think me most a knave or a fool,1,1,0.7777240661505702
at marlborough -- cried elinor more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at,1,1,0.875539462751354
yes -- i left london this morning at eight o'clock and the only ten minutes i have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at marlborough,1,1,0.83322046715589
mr willoughby you ought to feel and i certainly do -- that after what has passed -- your coming here in this manner and forcing yourself upon my notice requires a very particular excuse -- what is it that you mean by it --,1,1,0.8869961763959824
has she -- he cried in the same eager tone -- then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it but she shall forgive me again and on more reasonable grounds -- now will you listen to me,1,1,0.7600755091884563
they were both silent for a few moments elinor first spoke,1,1,0.7892502604893034
i do not know what i told her he replied impatiently less than was due to the past beyond a doubt and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future i cannot think of it -- it won't do -- then came your dear mother to torture me farther with all her kindness and confidence thank heaven it did torture me i was miserable miss dashwood you cannot have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery i owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid rascally folly of my own heart that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now well i went left all that i loved and went to those to whom at best i was only indifferent my journey to town -- travelling with my own horses and therefore so tediously -- no creature to speak to -- my own reflections so cheerful -- when i looked forward every thing so inviting -- when i looked back at barton the picture so soothing -- oh it was a blessed journey,1,1,0.9317030201116494
ah -- no -- have you forgot what passed in town -- that infamous letter -- did she shew it you,1,1,0.7745886111474696
this is not right mr willoughby -- remember that you are married relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear,1,1,0.8824912394120038
even so you would be surprised to hear how often i watched you how often i was on the point of falling in with you i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight as the carriage drove by lodging as i did in bond street there was hardly a day in which i did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight could have separated us so long i avoided the middletons as much as possible as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common not aware of their being in town however i blundered on sir john i believe the first day of his coming and the day after i had called at mrs jennings's he asked me to a party a dance at his house in the evening -- had he not told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there i should have felt it too certain a thing to trust myself near him the next morning brought another short note from marianne -- still affectionate open artless confiding -- everything that could make my conduct most hateful i could not answer it i tried -- but could not frame a sentence but i thought of her i believe every moment of the day if you can pity me miss dashwood pity my situation as it was then with my head and heart full of your sister i was forced to play the happy lover to another woman -- those three or four weeks were worse than all well at last as i need not tell you you were forced on me and what a sweet figure i cut -- what an evening of agony it was -- marianne beautiful as an angel on one side calling me willoughby in such a tone -- oh god -- holding out her hand to me asking me for an explanation with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face -- and sophia jealous as the devil on the other hand looking all that was -- well it does not signify it is over now -- such an evening -- i ran away from you all as soon as i could but not before i had seen marianne's sweet face as white as death -- that was the last last look i ever had of her -- the last manner in which she appeared to me it was a horrid sight -- yet when i thought of her to-day as really dying it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that i knew exactly how she would appear to those who saw her last in this world she was before me constantly before me as i travelled in the same look and hue,1,1,0.9613145578059389
elinor made no answer her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness dissipation and luxury had made in the mind the character the happiness of a man who to every advantage of person and talents united a disposition naturally open and honest and a feeling affectionate temper the world had made him extravagant and vain -- extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish vanity while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another had involved him in a real attachment which extravagance or at least its offspring necessity had required to be sacrificed each faulty propensity in leading him to evil had led him likewise to punishment the attachment from which against honour against feeling against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself now when no longer allowable governed every thought and the connection for the sake of which he had with little scruple left her sister to misery was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature from a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by willoughby who rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful started up in preparation for going and said --,1,1,0.9884106173996655
well -- he replied -- once more good bye i shall now go away and live in dread of one event,1,1,0.6097700683091195
you are very wrong she can never be more lost to you than she is now,1,1,0.6179581677951208
when at last she returned to the unconscious marianne she found her just awaking refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes elinor's heart was full the past the present the future willoughby's visit marianne's safety and her mother's expected arrival threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister short was the time however in which that fear could affect her for within half an hour after willoughby's leaving the house she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage -- eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment's horrible suspense she ran immediately into the hall and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it,1,1,0.9876820708723157
the shock of colonel brandon's errand at barton had been much softened to mrs dashwood by her own previous alarm for so great was her uneasiness about marianne that she had already determined to set out for cleveland on that very day without waiting for any further intelligence and had so far settled her journey before his arrival that the careys were then expected every moment to fetch margaret away as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection,1,1,0.9967389563355133
you are never like me dear elinor or i should wonder at your composure now had i sat down to wish for any possible good to my family i should have fixed on colonel brandon's marrying one of you as the object most desirable and i believe marianne will be the most happy with him of the two,1,1,0.9854200529369406
poor elinor -- here was a new scheme for getting her to delaford -- but her spirit was stubborn,1,1,0.8882012940922054
here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person and elinor withdrew to think it all over in private to wish success to her friend and yet in wishing it to feel a pang for willoughby,1,1,0.9110107444278341
when the weather is settled and i have recovered my strength said she we will take long walks together every day we will walk to the farm at the edge of the down and see how the children go on we will walk to sir john's new plantations at barton cross and the abbeyland and we will often go the old ruins of the priory and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached i know we shall be happy i know the summer will pass happily away i mean never to be later in rising than six and from that time till dinner i shall divide every moment between music and reading i have formed my plan and am determined to enter on a course of serious study our own library is too well known to me to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement but there are many works well worth reading at the park and there are others of more modern production which i know i can borrow of colonel brandon by reading only six hours a-day i shall gain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction which i now feel myself to want,1,1,0.7671276376820443
the sisters set out at a pace slow as the feebleness of marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her illness required -- and they had advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill the important hill behind when pausing with her eyes turned towards it marianne calmly said,1,1,0.7066815394942842
there exactly there -- pointing with one hand on that projecting mound -- there i fell and there i first saw willoughby,1,0,0.3099760551501157
no i compare it with what it ought to have been i compare it with yours,1,1,0.5617763102391682
you are very good -- the future must be my proof i have laid down my plan and if i am capable of adhering to it -- my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved they shall no longer worry others nor torture myself i shall now live solely for my family you my mother and margaret must henceforth be all the world to me you will share my affections entirely between you from you from my home i shall never again have the smallest incitement to move and if i do mix in other society it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled my heart amended and that i can practise the civilities the lesser duties of life with gentleness and forbearance as for willoughby -- to say that i shall soon or that i shall ever forget him would be idle his remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions but it shall be regulated it shall be checked by religion by reason by constant employment,1,1,0.881884774694429
elinor dreading her being tired led her towards home and till they reached the door of the cottage easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it talked of nothing but willoughby and their conversation together and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look where minuteness could be safely indulged as soon as they entered the house marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears tell mama withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up stairs elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its result and a resolution of reviving the subject again should marianne fail to do it she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting injunction,1,1,0.9886002293404578
mrs dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite she rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt -- she was sorry for him -- she wished him happy but the feelings of the past could not be recalled -- nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken -- a character unblemished to marianne nothing could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his means nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards eliza nothing could replace him therefore in her former esteem nor injure the interests of colonel brandon,1,1,0.9853577227260215
i know it -- i know it cried her mother happy with a man of libertine practices -- with one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends and the best of men -- no -- my marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man -- her conscience her sensitive conscience would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt,1,1,0.8302487845079775
it is very true my happiness never was his object,1,1,0.7939684190371344
at present continued elinor he regrets what he has done and why does he regret it -- because he finds it has not answered towards himself it has not made him happy his circumstances are now unembarrassed -- he suffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself but does it follow that had he married you he would have been happy -- the inconveniences would have been different he would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which because they are removed he now reckons as nothing he would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint but he would have been always necessitous -- always poor and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance even to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a wife,1,1,0.95760418857696
rather say your mother's imprudence my child said mrs dashwood she must be answerable,1,1,0.9375930585376598
marianne would not let her proceed -- and elinor satisfied that each felt their own error wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister's spirits she therefore pursuing the first subject immediately continued,1,1,0.9879858351050371
elinor grew impatient for some tidings of edward she had heard nothing of him since her leaving london nothing new of his plans nothing certain even of his present abode some letters had passed between her and her brother in consequence of marianne's illness and in the first of john's there had been this sentence -- we know nothing of our unfortunate edward and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject but conclude him to be still at oxford which was all the intelligence of edward afforded her by the correspondence for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters she was not doomed however to be long in ignorance of his measures,1,1,0.9917771090722112
i see mr ferrars myself ma'am this morning in exeter and his lady too miss steele as was they was stopping in a chaise at the door of the new london inn as i went there with a message from sally at the park to her brother who is one of the post-boys i happened to look up as i went by the chaise and so i see directly it was the youngest miss steele so i took off my hat and she knew me and called to me and inquired after you ma'am and the young ladies especially miss marianne and bid me i should give her compliments and mr ferrars's their best compliments and service and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you but they was in a great hurry to go forwards for they was going further down for a little while but howsever when they come back they'd make sure to come and see you,1,1,0.9484620099961238
elinor's heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward and mrs dashwood probably found the same explanation,1,1,0.9610825666308853
this was gaining something something to look forward to colonel brandon must have some information to give,1,1,0.8203153732372469
i meant said elinor taking up some work from the table to inquire for mrs edward ferrars,1,1,0.9664259724995101
mrs robert ferrars -- was repeated by marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement -- and though elinor could not speak even her eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder he rose from his seat and walked to the window apparently from not knowing what to do took up a pair of scissors that lay there and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke said in a hurried voice,1,1,0.8660052361068341
perhaps you do not know -- you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to -- to the youngest -- to miss lucy steele,1,1,0.9639051500412847
unaccountable however as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family it was certain that edward was free and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre-determined by all -- for after experiencing the blessings of one imprudent engagement contracted without his mother's consent as he had already done for more than four years nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of that than the immediate contraction of another,1,1,0.9462564740682149
it was a foolish idle inclination on my side said he the consequence of ignorance of the world -- and want of employment had my brother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr pratt i think -- nay i am sure it would never have happened for though i left longstaple with what i thought at the time a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months i should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing more with the world as in such case i must have done but instead of having any thing to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself i returned home to be completely idle and for the first twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen i had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy myself in love and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and was always sure of a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging she was pretty too -- at least i thought so then and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no comparisons and see no defects considering everything therefore i hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly,1,1,0.9944139898671156
edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week -- for whatever other claims might be made on him it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of elinor's company or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past the present and the future -- for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures yet with lovers it is different between them no subject is finished no communication is even made till it has been made at least twenty times over,1,1,0.9633496292023247
that was exactly like robert -- was his immediate observation -- and that he presently added might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began and lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour other designs might afterward arise,1,1,0.9321179188937154
she will be more hurt by it for robert always was her favourite -- she will be more hurt by it and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner,1,1,0.8423356331474966
in what state the affair stood at present between them edward knew not for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him he had quitted oxford within four and twenty hours after lucy's letter arrived and with only one object before him the nearest road to barton had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection he could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with miss dashwood and by his rapidity in seeking that fate it is to be supposed in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of colonel brandon in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts he did not upon the whole expect a very cruel reception it was his business however to say that he did and he said it very prettily what he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives,1,1,0.9862466997091914
a three weeks' residence at delaford where in his evening hours at least he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six and seventeen brought him to barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in marianne's looks all the kindness of her welcome and all the encouragement of her mother's language to make it cheerful among such friends however and such flattery he did revive no rumour of lucy's marriage had yet reached him -- he knew nothing of what had passed and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering every thing was explained to him by mrs dashwood and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for mr ferrars since eventually it promoted the interest of elinor,1,1,0.9964543158032593
it would be needless to say that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other as they advanced in each other's acquaintance for it could not be otherwise their resemblance in good principles and good sense in disposition and manner of thinking would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship without any other attraction but their being in love with two sisters and two sisters fond of each other made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment,1,1,0.947109606261076
the letters from town which a few days before would have made every nerve in elinor's body thrill with transport now arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth mrs jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl and pour forth her compassion towards poor mr edward who she was sure had quite doted upon the worthless hussy and was now by all accounts almost broken-hearted at oxford -- i do think she continued nothing was ever carried on so sly for it was but two days before lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me not a soul suspected anything of the matter not even nancy who poor soul came crying to me the day after in a great fright for fear of mrs ferrars as well as not knowing how to get to plymouth for lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married on purpose we suppose to make a show with and poor nancy had not seven shillings in the world -- so i was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to exeter where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with mrs burgess in hopes as i tell her to fall in with the doctor again and i must say that lucy's crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all poor mr edward i cannot get him out of my head but you must send for him to barton and miss marianne must try to comfort him,1,1,0.9885647189034206
you may certainly ask to be forgiven said elinor because you have offended -- and i should think you might now venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother's anger,1,1,0.914624457625093
and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first,1,1,0.8732410384224154
her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating for many years of her life she had had two sons but the crime and annihilation of edward a few weeks ago had robbed her of one the similar annihilation of robert had left her for a fortnight without any and now by the resuscitation of edward she had one again,1,1,0.9382732947281498
they were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations and friends mrs ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed of having authorised and even the dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from sussex to do them honour,1,1,0.9641036135395729
what edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son might have puzzled many people to find out and what robert had done to succeed to it might have puzzled them still more it was an arrangement however justified in its effects if not in its cause for nothing ever appeared in robert's style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income as either leaving his brother too little or bringing himself too much -- and if edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits he might be supposed no less contented with his lot no less free from every wish of an exchange,1,1,0.973511511402048

down down down would the fall never come to an end 'i wonder how many miles i've fallen by this time ' she said aloud 'i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think -- ' for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over ' -- yes that's about the right distance -- but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i've got to ' alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say,0,0,0.16420001758174688
it was all very well to say 'drink me ' but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry 'no i'll look first ' she said 'and see whether it's marked poison or not' for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison ' it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later,0,0,0.14961807756424303

and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this 'for it might end you know ' said alice to herself 'in my going out altogether like a candle i wonder what i should be like then ' and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing,0,0,0.42159969818873705
soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words 'eat me' were beautifully marked in currants 'well i'll eat it ' said alice 'and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way i'll get into the garden and i don't care which happens ',0,0,0.04903294969377507
'you ought to be ashamed of yourself ' said alice 'a great girl like you ' she might well say this 'to go on crying in this way stop this moment i tell you ' but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall,0,0,0.17317532818995832
'perhaps it doesn't understand english ' thought alice 'i daresay it's a french mouse come over with william the conqueror ' for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened so she began again 'ou est ma chatte ' which was the first sentence in her french lesson-book the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright 'oh i beg your pardon ' cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings 'i quite forgot you didn't like cats ',0,0,0.05096997613789546
'i won't indeed ' said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation 'are you -- are you fond -- of -- of dogs ' the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly 'there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you a little bright-eyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair and it'll fetch things when you throw them and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of things -- i can't remember half of them -- and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says it's so useful it's worth a hundred pounds he says it kills all the rats and -- oh dear ' cried alice in a sorrowful tone 'i'm afraid i've offended it again ' for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went,0,0,0.0536315874161322

by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass there was no label this time with the words 'drink me ' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips 'i know something interesting is sure to happen ' she said to herself 'whenever i eat or drink anything so i'll just see what this bottle does i do hope it'll make me grow large again for really i'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing ',0,0,0.16998686655711773
it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself 'that's quite enough -- i hope i shan't grow any more -- as it is i can't get out at the door -- i do wish i hadn't drunk quite so much ',0,0,0.46077677974434395
'that you won't' thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of the sort,0,0,0.07466874671701886

she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else,0,0,0.1943623181636952

she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit,0,0,0.4919011489415051
as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings,0,0,0.28018746620629187

'well be off then ' said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height,0,0,0.18965027281652957

there was however another man on board so to speak at the time him also by a curious coincidence the professor had not invented and him he had not even very greatly improved though he had fished him up with a lasso out of his own back garden in western bulgaria with the pure object of improving him he was an exceedingly holy man almost entirely covered with white hair you could see nothing but his eyes and he seemed to talk with them a monk of immense learning and acute intellect he had made himself happy in a little stone hut and a little stony garden in the balkans chiefly by writing the most crushing refutations of exposures of certain heresies the last professors of which had been burnt generally by each other precisely 1 119 years previously they were really very plausible and thoughtful heresies and it was really a creditable or even glorious circumstance that the old monk had been intellectual enough to detect their fallacy the only misfortune was that nobody in the modern world was intellectual enough even to understand their argument the old monk one of whose names was michael and the other a name quite impossible to remember or repeat in our western civilization had however as i have said made himself quite happy while he was in a mountain hermitage in the society of wild animals and now that his luck had lifted him above all the mountains in the society of a wild physicist he made himself happy still,0,0,0.20965456279957487

as i was observing continued michael this man also took the view that the symbol of christianity was a symbol of savagery and all unreason his history is rather amusing it is also a perfect allegory of what happens to rationalists like yourself he began of course by refusing to allow a crucifix in his house or round his wife's neck or even in a picture he said as you say that it was an arbitrary and fantastic shape that it was a monstrosity loved because it was paradoxical then he began to grow fiercer and more eccentric he would batter the crosses by the roadside for he lived in a roman catholic country finally in a height of frenzy he climbed the steeple of the parish church and tore down the cross waving it in the air and uttering wild soliloquies up there under the stars then one still summer evening as he was wending his way homewards along a lane the devil of his madness came upon him with a violence and transfiguration which changes the world he was standing smoking for a moment in the front of an interminable line of palings when his eyes were opened not a light shifted not a leaf stirred but he saw as if by a sudden change in the eyesight that this paling was an army of innumerable crosses linked together over hill and dale and he whirled up his heavy stick and went at it as if at an army mile after mile along his homeward path he broke it down and tore it up for he hated the cross and every paling is a wall of crosses when he returned to his house he was a literal madman he sat upon a chair and then started up from it for the cross-bars of the carpentry repeated the intolerable image he flung himself upon a bed only to remember that this too like all workmanlike things was constructed on the accursed plan he broke his furniture because it was made of crosses he burnt his house because it was made of crosses he was found in the river,0,0,0.026330418292624724

michael certainly could not have given any sort of rational account of this vast unmeaning satisfaction which soaked through him and filled him to the brim he felt with a sort of half-witted lucidity that the cross was there and the ball was there and the dome was there that he was going to climb down from them and that he did not mind in the least whether he was killed or not this mysterious mood lasted long enough to start him on his dreadful descent and to force him to continue it but six times before he reached the highest of the outer galleries terror had returned on him like a flying storm of darkness and thunder by the time he had reached that place of safety he almost felt as in some impossible fit of drunkenness that he had two heads one was calm careless and efficient the other saw the danger like a deadly map was wise careful and useless he had fancied that he would have to let himself vertically down the face of the whole building when he dropped into the upper gallery he still felt as far from the terrestrial globe as if he had only dropped from the sun to the moon he paused a little panting in the gallery under the ball and idly kicked his heels moving a few yards along it and as he did so a thunderbolt struck his soul a man a heavy ordinary man with a composed indifferent face and a prosaic sort of uniform with a row of buttons blocked his way michael had no mind to wonder whether this solid astonished man with the brown moustache and the nickel buttons had also come on a flying ship he merely let his mind float in an endless felicity about the man he thought how nice it would be if he had to live up in that gallery with that one man for ever he thought how he would luxuriate in the nameless shades of this man's soul and then hear with an endless excitement about the nameless shades of the souls of all his aunts and uncles a moment before he had been dying alone now he was living in the same world with a man an inexhaustible ecstasy in the gallery below the ball father michael had found that man who is the noblest and most divine and most lovable of all men better than all the saints greater than all the heroes -- man friday,0,0,0.04026312201368457

if you pressed that point i might reply that it was very probable answered macian calmly i often fancy that your historical generalizations rest frequently on random instances i should not be surprised if your vague notions of the church as the persecutor of science was a generalization from galileo i should not be at all surprised if when you counted the scientific investigations and discoveries since the fall of rome you found that a great mass of them had been made by monks but the matter is irrelevant to my meaning i say that if you want an example of anything which has progressed in the moral world by the same method as science in the material world by continually adding to without unsettling what was there before then i say that there is only one example of it and that is us,0,0,0.2969496773156749
who talked of such folly asked macian disdainfully do you suppose that the catholic church ever held that christians were the only good men why the catholics of the catholic middle ages talked about the virtues of all the virtuous pagans until humanity was sick of the subject no if you really want to know what we mean when we say that christianity has a special power of virtue i will tell you the church is the only thing on earth that can perpetuate a type of virtue and make it something more than a fashion the thing is so plain and historical that i hardly think you will ever deny it you cannot deny that it is perfectly possible that tomorrow morning in ireland or in italy there might appear a man not only as good but good in exactly the same way as st francis of assisi very well now take the other types of human virtue many of them splendid the english gentleman of elizabeth was chivalrous and idealistic but can you stand still here in this meadow and be an english gentleman of elizabeth the austere republican of the eighteenth century with his stern patriotism and his simple life was a fine fellow but have you ever seen him have you ever seen an austere republican only a hundred years have passed and that volcano of revolutionary truth and valour is as cold as the mountains of the moon and so it is and so it will be with the ethics which are buzzing down fleet street at this instant as i speak what phrase would inspire the london clerk or workman just now perhaps that he is a son of the british empire on which the sun never sets perhaps that he is a prop of his trades union or a class-conscious proletarian something or other perhaps merely that he is a gentleman when he obviously is not those names and notions are all honourable but how long will they last empires break industrial conditions change the suburbs will not last for ever what will remain i will tell you the catholic saint will remain,0,0,0.09716874498180397

a rainy twilight was clearing to cold silver over the moaning sea when the battered boat that had rolled and drifted almost aimlessly all night came within sight of land though of land which looked almost as lost and savage as the waves all night there had been but little lifting in the leaden sea only now and then the boat had been heaved up as on a huge shoulder which slipped from under it such occasional sea-quakes came probably from the swell of some steamer that had passed it in the dark otherwise the waves were harmless though restless but it was piercingly cold and there was from time to time a splutter of rain like the splutter of the spray which seemed almost to freeze as it fell macian more at home than his companion in this quite barbarous and elemental sort of adventure had rowed toilsomely with the heavy oars whenever he saw anything that looked like land but for the most part had trusted with grim transcendentalism to wind and tide among the implements of their first outfit the brandy alone had remained to him and he gave it to his freezing companion in quantities which greatly alarmed that temperate londoner but macian came from the cold seas and mists where a man can drink a tumbler of raw whisky in a boat without it making him wink,0,0,0.04486385461310951

we must break away from him here he cried briefly and went like a whirlwind over the sand ridge in a straight line and at a particular angle when the policeman had finished his admirable railway curve he found a wall of failing sand between him and the pursued by the time he had scaled it thrice slid down twice and crested it in the third effort the two flying figures were far in front they found the sand harder farther on it began to be crusted with scraps of turf and in a few moments they were flying easily over an open common of rank sea-grass they had no easy business however for the bottle which they had so innocently sent into the chief gate of thanet had called to life the police of half a county on their trail from every side across the grey-green common figures could be seen running and closing in and it was only when macian with his big body broke down the tangled barrier of a little wood as men break down a door with the shoulder it was only when they vanished crashing into the underworld of the black wood that their hunters were even instantaneously thrown off the scent,0,0,0.01274791561112847

a wash of weary daylight was breaking over the country-side and the fields and roads were full of white mist -- the kind of white mist that clings in corners like cotton wool the empty road along which the chase had taken its turn was overshadowed on one side by a very high discoloured wall stained and streaked green as with seaweed -- evidently the high-shouldered sentinel of some great gentleman's estate a yard or two from the wall ran parallel to it a linked and tangled line of lime-trees forming a kind of cloister along the side of the road it was under this branching colonnade that the two fugitives fled almost concealed from their pursuers by the twilight the mist and the leaping zoetrope of shadows their feet though beating the ground furiously made but a faint noise for they had kicked away their boots in the wood their long antiquated weapons made no jingle or clatter for they had strapped them across their backs like guitars they had all the advantages that invisibility and silence can add to speed,0,0,0.00996927451103968

the consulting-rooms of dr orion hood the eminent criminologist and specialist in certain moral disorders lay along the sea-front at scarborough in a series of very large and well-lighted french windows which showed the north sea like one endless outer wall of blue-green marble in such a place the sea had something of the monotony of a blue-green dado for the chambers themselves were ruled throughout by a terrible tidiness not unlike the terrible tidiness of the sea it must not be supposed that dr hood's apartments excluded luxury or even poetry these things were there in their place but one felt that they were never allowed out of their place luxury was there there stood upon a special table eight or ten boxes of the best cigars but they were built upon a plan so that the strongest were always nearest the wall and the mildest nearest the window a tantalus containing three kinds of spirit all of a liqueur excellence stood always on this table of luxury but the fanciful have asserted that the whisky brandy and rum seemed always to stand at the same level poetry was there the left-hand corner of the room was lined with as complete a set of english classics as the right hand could show of english and foreign physiologists but if one took a volume of chaucer or shelley from that rank its absence irritated the mind like a gap in a man's front teeth one could not say the books were never read probably they were but there was a sense of their being chained to their places like the bibles in the old churches dr hood treated his private book-shelf as if it were a public library and if this strict scientific intangibility steeped even the shelves laden with lyrics and ballads and the tables laden with drink and tobacco it goes without saying that yet more of such heathen holiness protected the other shelves that held the specialist's library and the other tables that sustained the frail and even fairylike instruments of chemistry or mechanics,0,0,0.023059728666554837

as modern newspapers are conducted the most honest and most important news is the police news if it be true that in the twentieth century more space is given to murder than to politics it is for the excellent reason that murder is a more serious subject but even this would hardly explain the enormous omnipresence and widely distributed detail of the bruno case or the passage mystery in the press of london and the provinces so vast was the excitement that for some weeks the press really told the truth and the reports of examination and cross-examination if interminable even if intolerable are at least reliable the true reason of course was the coincidence of persons the victim was a popular actress the accused was a popular actor and the accused had been caught red-handed as it were by the most popular soldier of the patriotic season in those extraordinary circumstances the press was paralysed into probity and accuracy and the rest of this somewhat singular business can practically be recorded from reports of bruno's trial,0,0,0.10702332234629158

captain cutler was a far less plausible and composed witness than sir wilson but his account of the opening incidents was solidly the same he described the return of bruno to his dressing-room the dispatching of himself to buy a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley his return to the upper end of the passage the thing he saw in the passage his suspicion of seymour and his struggle with bruno but he could give little artistic assistance about the black figure that he and seymour had seen asked about its outline he said he was no art critic -- with a somewhat too obvious sneer at seymour asked if it was a man or a woman he said it looked more like a beast -- with a too obvious snarl at the prisoner but the man was plainly shaken with sorrow and sincere anger and cowdray quickly excused him from confirming facts that were already fairly clear,0,0,0.11204214641189918
the third witness called by sir walter cowdray was the little catholic clergyman so little compared with the others that his head seemed hardly to come above the box so that it was like cross-examining a child but unfortunately sir walter had somehow got it into his head mostly by some ramifications of his family's religion that father brown was on the side of the prisoner because the prisoner was wicked and foreign and even partly black therefore he took father brown up sharply whenever that proud pontiff tried to explain anything and told him to answer yes or no and tell the plain facts without any jesuitry when father brown began in his simplicity to say who he thought the man in the passage was the barrister told him that he did not want his theories,0,0,0.06333299727581275

that's how the whole thing looks supposing this rian made for pilgrim's pond to kill todd so it looked to me till another little discovery woke up what i have of the detective in me when i had my prisoner safe i picked up my cane again and strolled down the two or three turns of country road that brought me to one of the side entrances of todd's grounds the one nearest to the pool or lake after which the place is named it was some two hours ago about seven by this time the moonlight was more luminous and i could see the long white streaks of it lying on the mysterious mere with its grey greasy half-liquid shores in which they say our fathers used to make witches walk until they sank i'd forgotten the exact tale but you know the place i mean it lies north of todd's house towards the wilderness and has two queer wrinkled trees so dismal that they look more like huge fungoids than decent foliage as i stood peering at this misty pool i fancied i saw the faint figure of a man moving from the house towards it but it was all too dim and distant for one to be certain of the fact and still less of the details besides my attention was very sharply arrested by something much closer i crouched behind the fence which ran not more than two hundred yards from one wing of the great mansion and which was fortunately split in places as if specially for the application of a cautious eye a door had opened in the dark bulk of the left wing and a figure appeared black against the illuminated interior -- a muffled figure bending forward evidently peering out into the night it closed the door behind it and i saw it was carrying a lantern which threw a patch of imperfect light on the dress and figure of the wearer it seemed to be the figure of a woman wrapped up in a ragged cloak and evidently disguised to avoid notice there was something very strange both about the rags and the furtiveness in a person coming out of those rooms lined with gold she took cautiously the curved garden path which brought her within half a hundred yards of me -- then she stood up for an instant on the terrace of turf that looks towards the slimy lake and holding her flaming lantern above her head she deliberately swung it three times to and fro as for a signal as she swung it the second time a flicker of its light fell for a moment on her own face a face that i knew she was unnaturally pale and her head was bundled in her borrowed plebeian shawl but i am certain it was etta todd the millionaire's daughter,0,0,0.00793147913989733

father brown was in no mood for adventures he had lately fallen ill with over-work and when he began to recover his friend flambeau had taken him on a cruise in a small yacht with sir cecil fanshaw a young cornish squire and an enthusiast for cornish coast scenery but brown was still rather weak he was no very happy sailor and though he was never of the sort that either grumbles or breaks down his spirits did not rise above patience and civility when the other two men praised the ragged violet sunset or the ragged volcanic crags he agreed with them when flambeau pointed out a rock shaped like a dragon he looked at it and thought it very like a dragon when fanshaw more excitedly indicated a rock that was like merlin he looked at it and signified assent when flambeau asked whether this rocky gate of the twisted river was not the gate of fairyland he said yes he heard the most important things and the most trivial with the same tasteless absorption he heard that the coast was death to all but careful seamen he also heard that the ship's cat was asleep he heard that fanshaw couldn't find his cigar-holder anywhere he also heard the pilot deliver the oracle both eyes bright she's all right one eye winks down she sinks he heard flambeau say to fanshaw that no doubt this meant the pilot must keep both eyes open and be spry and he heard fanshaw say to flambeau that oddly enough it didn't mean this it meant that while they saw two of the coast lights one near and the other distant exactly side by side they were in the right river-channel but that if one light was hidden behind the other they were going on the rocks he heard fanshaw add that his country was full of such quaint fables and idioms it was the very home of romance he even pitted this part of cornwall against devonshire as a claimant to the laurels of elizabethan seamanship according to him there had been captains among these coves and islets compared with whom drake was practically a landsman he heard flambeau laugh and ask if perhaps the adventurous title of westward ho only meant that all devonshire men wished they were living in cornwall he heard fanshaw say there was no need to be silly that not only had cornish captains been heroes but that they were heroes still that near that very spot there was an old admiral now retired who was scarred by thrilling voyages full of adventures and who had in his youth found the last group of eight pacific islands that was added to the chart of the world this cecil fanshaw was in person of the kind that commonly urges such crude but pleasing enthusiasms a very young man light-haired high-coloured with an eager profile with a boyish bravado of spirits but an almost girlish delicacy of tint and type the big shoulders black brows and black mousquetaire swagger of flambeau were a great contrast,0,0,0.02602900949739397

ah replied the sceptical traveller but you don't know how much of the old legend may have been made up from the old figures besides it isn't the only old legend fanshaw here who is fond of such things will tell you there are other versions of the tale and much more horrible ones one story credits my unfortunate ancestor with having had the spaniard cut in two and that will fit the pretty picture also another obligingly credits our family with the possession of a tower full of snakes and explains those little wriggly things in that way and a third theory supposes the crooked line on the ship to be a conventionalized thunderbolt but that alone if seriously examined would show what a very little way these unhappy coincidences really go,0,0,0.09736092593453262

then there fell upon him the great temptation that was to torment him for many days in the presence of these powerful and repulsive men who were the princes of anarchy he had almost forgotten the frail and fanciful figure of the poet gregory the mere aesthete of anarchism he even thought of him now with an old kindness as if they had played together when children but he remembered that he was still tied to gregory by a great promise he had promised never to do the very thing that he now felt himself almost in the act of doing he had promised not to jump over that balcony and speak to that policeman he took his cold hand off the cold stone balustrade his soul swayed in a vertigo of moral indecision he had only to snap the thread of a rash vow made to a villainous society and all his life could be as open and sunny as the square beneath him he had on the other hand only to keep his antiquated honour and be delivered inch by inch into the power of this great enemy of mankind whose very intellect was a torture-chamber whenever he looked down into the square he saw the comfortable policeman a pillar of common sense and common order whenever he looked back at the breakfast-table he saw the president still quietly studying him with big unbearable eyes,0,0,0.08324437424284183

syme had gone quite red up to his yellow hair and his eyes were burning feverishly as he said he had an intuition and it had risen to a sort of lightheaded certainty resuming his symbolic taps he signalled to his friend you scarcely realise how poetic my intuition is it has that sudden quality we sometimes feel in the coming of spring,0,0,0.12061044733803278

the professor seized syme roughly by the waistcoat,0,0,0.03238402624102455
my remarks are almost painfully practical answered syme in an unhurried manner the house of st eustache also is very ancient the marquis cannot deny that he is a gentleman he cannot deny that i am a gentleman and in order to put the matter of my social position quite beyond a doubt i propose at the earliest opportunity to knock his hat off but here we are in the harbour,0,0,0.05452102242992606
syme sat down at a cafe table with his companions his blue eyes sparkling like the bright sea below and ordered a bottle of saumur with a pleased impatience he was for some reason in a condition of curious hilarity his spirits were already unnaturally high they rose as the saumur sank and in half an hour his talk was a torrent of nonsense he professed to be making out a plan of the conversation which was going to ensue between himself and the deadly marquis he jotted it down wildly with a pencil it was arranged like a printed catechism with questions and answers and was delivered with an extraordinary rapidity of utterance,0,0,0.11103744130666271
i shall approach before taking off his hat i shall take off my own i shall say 'the marquis de saint eustache i believe ' he will say 'the celebrated mr syme i presume ' he will say in the most exquisite french 'how are you ' i shall reply in the most exquisite cockney 'oh just the syme -- ',0,0,0.06961050589586723
but what's the good of it all asked dr bull in exasperation,0,0,0.037825402695077566
it leads up to my challenge don't you see said syme beaming when the marquis has given the thirty-ninth reply which runs --,0,0,0.06721523589028627
it seems to me said the other that you are simply seeking a pretext to insult the marquis,0,0,0.12519132980088582
he had correctly calculated in this case the policy of his opponent when the marquis was informed by his seconds that syme could only fight in the morning he must fully have realised that an obstacle had suddenly arisen between him and his bomb-throwing business in the capital naturally he could not explain this objection to his friends so he chose the course which syme had predicted he induced his seconds to settle on a small meadow not far from the railway and he trusted to the fatality of the first engagement,0,0,0.2290622336384008
dr bull however having been carefully coached by syme upon this point of policy insisted with great dignity and in very bad french that it should continue until one of the combatants was disabled syme had made up his mind that he could avoid disabling the marquis and prevent the marquis from disabling him for at least twenty minutes in twenty minutes the paris train would have gone by,0,0,0.08659838152418389
to a man of the well-known skill and valour of monsieur de st eustache said the professor solemnly it must be a matter of indifference which method is adopted and our principal has strong reasons for demanding the longer encounter reasons the delicacy of which prevent me from being explicit but for the just and honourable nature of which i can --,0,0,0.24066089707921687
but the marquis's morbid energy over-reached itself twice syme parrying knocked his opponent's point far out of the fighting circle and the third time his riposte was so rapid that there was no doubt about the hit this time syme's sword actually bent under the weight of the marquis's body which it had pierced,0,0,0.04088170158089013
there was an instant of rigid silence and then syme in his turn fell furiously on the other filled with a flaming curiosity the marquis was probably in a general sense a better fencer than he as he had surmised at the beginning but at the moment the marquis seemed distraught and at a disadvantage he fought wildly and even weakly and he constantly looked away at the railway line almost as if he feared the train more than the pointed steel syme on the other hand fought fiercely but still carefully in an intellectual fury eager to solve the riddle of his own bloodless sword for this purpose he aimed less at the marquis's body and more at his throat and head a minute and a half afterwards he felt his point enter the man's neck below the jaw it came out clean half mad he thrust again and made what should have been a bloody scar on the marquis's cheek but there was no scar,0,0,0.014897687970165545
he fell to fighting again with a supernatural levity like a mohammedan panting for paradise as the train came nearer and nearer he fancied he could see people putting up the floral arches in paris he joined in the growing noise and the glory of the great republic whose gate he was guarding against hell his thoughts rose higher and higher with the rising roar of the train which ended as if proudly in a long and piercing whistle the train stopped,0,0,0.026483110666808956
suddenly to the astonishment of everyone the marquis sprang back quite out of sword reach and threw down his sword the leap was wonderful and not the less wonderful because syme had plunged his sword a moment before into the man's thigh,0,0,0.010391116266542615
it is certainly somewhat opposed to precedent said colonel ducroix looking wistfully at his principal there is i think one case on record captain bellegarde and the baron zumpt in which the weapons were changed in the middle of the encounter at the request of one of the combatants but one can hardly call one's nose a weapon,0,0,0.18017300984979787
syme had the feeling he had more than once had in these adventures -- the sense that a horrible and sublime wave lifted to heaven was just toppling over walking in a world he half understood he took two paces forward and seized the roman nose of this remarkable nobleman he pulled it hard and it came off in his hand,0,0,0.034586363404525595

some time or other cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me there now is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by wharves as indian isles by coral reefs -- commerce surrounds it with her surf right and left the streets take you waterward its extreme downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by waves and cooled by breezes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land look at the crowds of water-gazers there circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from corlears hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you see -- posted like silent sentinels all around the town stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries some leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pier-heads some looking over the bulwarks of ships from china some high aloft in the rigging as if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are all landsmen of week days pent up in lath and plaster -- tied to counters nailed to benches clinched to desks how then is this are the green fields gone what do they here but look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a dive strange nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice no they must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in and there they stand -- miles of them -- leagues inlanders all they come from lanes and alleys streets and avenues -- north east south and west yet here they all unite tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither once more say you are in the country in some high land of lakes take almost any path you please and ten to one it carries you down in a dale and leaves you there by a pool in the stream there is magic in it let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries -- stand that man on

happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor yes as every one knows meditation and water are wedded for ever but here is an artist he desires to paint you the dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the saco what is the chief element he employs there stand his trees each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were within and here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue but though the picture lies thus tranced and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd's head yet all were vain unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him go visit the prairies in june when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among tiger-lilies -- what is the one charm wanting -- water -- there is not a drop of water there were niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeks give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it all now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious of my lungs i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it besides passengers get sea-sick -- grow quarrelsome -- don't sleep of nights -- do not enjoy themselves much as a general thing -- no i never go as a passenger nor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea as a commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them for my part i abominate all honourable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind whatsoever it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself without taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what not and as for going as cook -- though i confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board -- yet somehow i never fancied broiling fowls -- though once broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids no when i go to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal mast-head true they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough it touches one's sense of honour particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster making the tallest boys stand in awe of you the transition is a keen one i assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wears off in time what of it if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks what does that indignity amount to weighed i mean in the scales of the new testament do you think the archangel gabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance who ain't a slave tell me that well then however the old sea-captains may order me about -- however they may thump and punch me about i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way -- either in a physical or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades and be content again i always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves must pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us but being paid -- what will compare with it the urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition finally i always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck for as in this world head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern that is if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it first but not so in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things at the same time that the leaders little suspect it but wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of the fates who has the constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences me in some unaccountable way -- he can better answer than any one else and doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago it came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this grand contested election for the presidency of the united states whaling voyage by one ishmael bloody battle in affghanistan though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers the fates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short and easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in farces -- though i cannot tell why this was exactly yet now that i recall all the circumstances i think i can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises induced me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with all the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds helped to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such things would not have been inducements but as for me i am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote i love to sail forbidden seas and land on barbarous coasts not ignoring what is good i am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with it -- would they let me -- since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in by reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air chapter 2 the carpet-bag i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag tucked it under my arm and started for cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city of old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it was a saturday night in december much was i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place would offer till the following monday as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may as well be related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind was made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there was a fine boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket was her great original -- the tyre of this carthage -- the place where the first dead american whale was stranded where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen the red-men first sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported cobblestones -- so goes the story -- to throw at the whales in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit now having a night a day and still another night following before me in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile it was a very dubious-looking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silver -- so wherever you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south -- wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire the price and don't be too particular with halting steps i paced the streets and passed the sign of the crossed harpoons -- but it looked too expensive and jolly there further on from the bright red windows of the sword-fish inn there came such fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard asphaltic pavement -- rather weary for me when i struck my foot against the flinty projections because from hard remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within but go on ishmael said i at last don't you hear get away from before the door your patched boots are stopping the way so on i went i now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inns such dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly open it had a careless look as if it were meant for the uses of the public so entering the first thing i did was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch ha thought i ha as the flying particles almost choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city gomorrah but the crossed harpoons and the sword-fish -- this then must needs be the sign of the trap however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a second interior door it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel of doom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of 'the trap ' moving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words underneath -- the spouter inn -- peter coffin coffin -- spouter -- rather ominous in that particular connexion thought i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there as the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffee it was a queer sort of place -- a gable-ended old house one side palsied as it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor paul's tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind called euroclydon says an old writer -- of whose works i possess the only copy extant -- it maketh a marvellous difference whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both sides and of which the wight death is the only glazier true enough thought i as this passage occurred to my mind -- old black-letter thou reasonest well yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is the house what a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the crannies though and thrust in a little lint here and there but it's too late to make any improvements now the universe is finished the copestone is on and the chips were carted off a million years ago poor lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings he might plug up both ears with rags and put a corn-cob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous euroclydon euroclydon says old dives in his red silken wrapper -- he had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what a fine frosty night how orion glitters what northern lights let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals but what thinks lazarus can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights would not lazarus rather be in sumatra than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit itself in order to keep out this frost now that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the moluccas yet dives himself he too lives like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of a temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans but no more of this blubbering now we are going a-whaling and there is plenty of that yet to come let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet and see what sort of a place this spouter may be chapter 3 the spouter-inn entering that gable-ended spouter-inn you found yourself in a wide low straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new england hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted yet was there a sort of indefinite half-attained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant ever and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you through -- it's the black sea in a midnight gale -- it's the unnatural combat of the four primal elements -- it's a blasted heath -- it's a hyperborean winter scene -- it's the breaking-up of the icebound stream of time but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture's midst that once found out and all the rest were plain but stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself in fact the artist's design seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a cape-horner in a great hurricane the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with knots of human hair and one was sickle-shaped with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower you shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed some were storied weapons with this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoon -- so like a corkscrew now -- was flung in javan seas and run away with by a whale years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the hump crossing this dusky entry and on through yon low-arched way -- cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round -- you enter the public room a still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft's cockpits especially of such a howling night when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den -- the bar -- a rude attempt at a right whale's head be that how it may there stands the vast arched bone of the whale's jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it within are shabby shelves ranged round with old decanters bottles flasks and in those jaws of swift destruction like another cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him bustles a little withered old man who for their money dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison though true cylinders without -- within the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpads' goblets fill to this mark and your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so on to the full glass -- the cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about a table examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander i sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house was full -- not a bed unoccupied but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer's blanket have ye i s'pose you are goin' a-whalin' so you'd better get used to that sort of thing i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent man's blanket i thought so all right take a seat supper -- you want supper supper'll be ready directly i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the battery at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack-knife stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail but he didn't make much headway i thought at last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room it was cold as iceland -- no fire at all -- the landlord said he couldn't afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candles each in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jackets and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers but the fare was of the most substantial kind -- not only meat and potatoes but dumplings good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner my boy said the landlord you'll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty landlord i whispered that aint the harpooneer is it oh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumplings he don't -- he eats nothing but steaks and he likes 'em rare the devil he does says i where is that harpooneer is he here he'll be here afore long was the answer i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark complexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before i did supper over the company went back to the bar-room when knowing not what else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on presently a rioting noise was heard without starting up the landlord cried that's the grampus's crew i seed her reported in the offing this morning a three years' voyage and a full ship hurrah boys now we'll have the latest news from the feegees a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough enveloped in their shaggy watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters all bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they seemed an eruption of bears from labrador they had just landed from their boat and this was the first house they entered no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whale's mouth -- the bar -- when the wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round one complained of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the weather side of an ice-island the liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea and they began capering about most obstreperously i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest this man interested me at once and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleeping-partner one so far as this narrative is concerned i will here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six feet in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a coffer-dam i have seldom seen such brawn in a man his face was deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy his voice at once announced that he was a southerner and from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea in a few minutes however he was missed by his shipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised a cry of bulkington bulkington where's bulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of him it was now about nine o'clock and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen no man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother i don't know how it is but people like to be private when they are sleeping and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitely multiply nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated the thought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume that being a harpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of the tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over besides it was getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnight -- how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming landlord i've changed my mind about that harpooneer -- i shan't sleep with him i'll try the bench here just as you please i'm sorry i cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and it's a plaguy rough board here -- feeling of the knots and notches but wait a bit skrimshander i've got a carpenter's plane there in the bar -- wait i say and i'll make ye snug enough so saying he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning like an ape the shavings flew right and left till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord was near spraining his wrist and i told him for heaven's sake to quit -- the bed was soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the shavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a brown study i now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but that could be mended with a chair but it was a foot too narrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one -- so there was no yoking them i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night the devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop couldn't i steal a march on him -- bolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be wakened by the most violent knockings it seemed no bad idea but upon second thoughts i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next morning so soon as i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be standing in the entry all ready to knock me down still looking round me again and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed i began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer thinks i i'll wait awhile he must be dropping in before long i'll have a good look at him then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all -- there's no telling but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer landlord said i what sort of a chap is he -- does he always keep such late hours it was now hard upon twelve o'clock the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no he answered generally he's an early bird -- airley to bed and airley to rise -- yes he's the bird what catches the worm but to-night he went out a peddling you see and i don't see what on airth keeps him so late unless may be he can't sell his head can't sell his head -- what sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to say landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town that's precisely it said the landlord and i told him he couldn't sell it here the market's overstocked with what shouted i with heads to be sure ain't there too many heads in the world i tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly you'd better stop spinning that yarn to me -- i'm not green may be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i rayther guess you'll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin' his head i'll break it for him said i now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's it's broke a'ready said he broke said i -- broke do you mean sartain and that's the very reason he can't sell it i guess landlord said i going up to him as cool as mt hecla in a snow-storm -- landlord stop whittling you and i must understand one another and that too without delay i come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow -- a sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him and in the first place you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and i've no idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution wall said the landlord fetching a long breath that's a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then but be easy be easy this here harpooneer i have been tellin' you of has just arrived from the south seas where he bought up a lot of 'balmed new zealand heads great curios you know and he's sold all on 'em but one and that one he's trying to sell to-night cause to-morrow's sunday and it would not do to be sellin' human heads about the streets when folks is goin' to churches he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just as he was goin' out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the airth like a string of inions this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling me -- but at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man he pays reg'lar was the rejoinder but come it's getting dreadful late you had better be turning flukes -- it's a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced there's plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed it's an almighty big bed that why afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm arter that sal said it wouldn't do come along here i'll give ye a glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a clock in the corner he exclaimed i vum it's sunday -- you won't see that harpooneer to-night he's come to anchor somewhere -- come along then do come won't ye come i considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and i was ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast there said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table there make yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from eyeing the bed but he had disappeared folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale of things not properly belonging to the room there was a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seaman's bag containing the harpooneer's wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk likewise there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian moccasin there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat as you see the same in south american ponchos but could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the streets of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and i thought a little damp as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on the bed-side i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed as i was and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that night it being so very late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care of heaven whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door lord save me thinks i that must be the harpooneer the infernal head-peddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical new zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room i was all eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth this accomplished however he turned round -- when good heavens what a sight such a face it was of a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares yes it's just as i thought he's a terrible bedfellow he's been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all those black squares on his cheeks they were stains of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of a white man -- a whaleman too -- who falling among the cannibals had been tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure and what is it thought i after all it's only his outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the squares of tattooing to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one however i had never been in the south seas and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin now while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some difficulty having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new zealand head -- a ghastly thing enough -- and crammed it down into the bag he now took off his hat -- a new beaver hat -- when i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise there was no hair on his head -- none to speak of at least -- nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull had not the stranger stood between me and the door i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner even as it was i thought something of slipping out of the window but it was the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night in fact i was so afraid of him that i was not game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed his chest and arms as i live these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a thirty years' war and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt still more his very legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms it was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south seas and so landed in this christian country i quaked to think of it a peddler of heads too -- perhaps the heads of his own brothers he might take a fancy to mine -- heavens look at that tomahawk but there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back and exactly the colour of a three days' old congo baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner but seeing that it was not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place and removing the papered fire-board sets up this little hunch-backed image like a tenpin between the andirons the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease meantime -- to see what was next to follow first he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and places them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatches into the fire and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ashes a little he made a polite offer of it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips all these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations and jumping into bed with me i thought it was high time now or never before the light was put out to break the spell in which i had so long been bound but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke the next moment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning who-e debel you -- he at last said -- you no speak-e dam-me i kill-e and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark landlord for god's sake peter coffin shouted i landlord watch coffin angels save me speak-e tell-ee me who-ee be or dam-me i kill-e again growled the cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him don't be afraid now said he grinning again queequeg here wouldn't harm a hair of your head stop your grinning shouted i and why didn't you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal i thought ye know'd it -- didn't i tell ye he was a peddlin' heads around town -- but turn flukes again and go to sleep queequeg look here -- you sabbee me i sabbee -- you this man sleepe you -- you sabbee me sabbee plenty -- grunted queequeg puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed you gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a moment for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comely looking cannibal what's all this fuss i have been making about thought i to myself -- the man's a human being just as i am he has just as much reason to fear me as i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian landlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will turn in with him but i don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me it's dangerous besides i ain't insured this being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely motioned me to get into bed -- rolling over to one side as much as to say -- i won't touch a leg of ye good night landlord said i you may go i turned in and never slept better in my life chapter 4 the counterpane upon waking next morning about daylight i found queequeg's arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost thought i had been his wife the counterpane was of patchwork full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure no two parts of which were of one precise shade -- owing i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times -- this same arm of his i say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt indeed partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke i could hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hues together and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg was hugging me my sensations were strange let me try to explain them when i was a child i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it was a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle the circumstance was this i had been cutting up some caper or other -- i think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a little sweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other was all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperless -- my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st june the longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but there was no help for it so up stairs i went to my little room in the third floor undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before i could hope for a resurrection sixteen hours in bed the small of my back ached to think of it and it was so light too the sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coaches in the streets and the sound of gay voices all over the house i felt worse and worse -- at last i got up dressed and softly going down in my stockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself at her feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time but she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers and back i had to go to my room for several hours i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than i have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly waking from it -- half steeped in dreams -- i opened my eyes and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame nothing was to be seen and nothing was to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine my arm hung over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my bed-side for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay there frozen with the most awful fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered it all and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i often puzzle myself with it now take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequeg's pagan arm thrown round me but at length all the past night's events soberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament for though i tried to move his arm -- unlock his bridegroom clasp -- yet sleeping as he was he still hugged me tightly as though naught but death should part us twain i now strove to rouse him -- queequeg -- but his only answer was a snore i then rolled over my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar and suddenly felt a slight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side as if it were a hatchet-faced baby a pretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequeg -- in the name of goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiff as a pike-staff looking at me and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature when at last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow and he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon the floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself thinks i queequeg under the circumstances this is a very civilized overture but the truth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this particular compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so much civility and consideration while i was guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motions for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless a man like queequeg you don't see every day he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one by the by and then -- still minus his trowsers -- he hunted up his boots what under the heavens he did it for i cannot tell but his next movement was to crush himself -- boots in hand and hat on -- under the bed when from sundry violent gaspings and strainings i inferred he was hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his boots but queequeg do you see was a creature in the transition stage -- neither caterpillar nor butterfly he was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners his education was not yet completed he was an undergraduate if he had not been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all but then if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on at last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes and began creaking and limping about the room as if not being much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide ones -- probably not made to order either -- rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning seeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that the street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boots on i begged him as well as i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible he complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to my amazement contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest arms and hands he then donned his waistcoat and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face i was watching to see where he kept his razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed corner slips out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begins a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheeks thinks i queequeg this is using rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept the rest of his toilet was soon achieved and he proudly marched out of the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his harpoon like a marshal's baton chapter 5 breakfast i quickly followed suit and descending into the bar-room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no malice towards him though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the more's the pity so if any one man in his own proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for the bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous and whom i had not as yet had a good look at they were nearly all whalemen chief mates and second mates and third mates and sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and harpooneers and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with bosky beards an unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore this young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue and would seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three days landed from his indian voyage that man next him looks a few shades lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached withal he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore but who could show a cheek like queequeg which barred with various tints seemed like the andes' western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climates zone by zone grub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went to breakfast they say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease in manner quite self-possessed in company not always though ledyard the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart of africa which was the sum of poor mungo's performances -- this kind of travel i say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table and i was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence and not only that but they looked embarrassed yes here were a set of sea-dogs many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas -- entire strangers to them -- and duelled them dead without winking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast table -- all of the same calling all of kindred tastes -- looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains a curious sight these bashful bears these timid warrior whalemen but as for queequeg -- why queequeg sat there among them -- at the head of the table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle to be sure i cannot say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many heads and grappling the beefsteaks towards him but that was certainly very coolly done by him and every one knows that in most people's estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly we will not speak of all queequeg's peculiarities here how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks done rare enough that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawk-pipe and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when i sallied out for a stroll chapter 6 the street if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford in thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts even in broadway and chestnut streets mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies regent street is not unknown to lascars and malays and at bombay in the apollo green live yankees have often scared the natives but new bedford beats all water street and wapping in these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors but in new bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners savages outright many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh it makes a stranger stare but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians and brighggians and besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets you will see other sights still more curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this town scores of green vermonters and new hampshire men all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery they are mostly young of stalwart frames fellows who have felled forests and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance many are as green as the green mountains whence they came in some things you would think them but a few hours old look there that chap strutting round the corner he wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed coat girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife here comes another with a sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak no town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one -- i mean a downright bumpkin dandy -- a fellow that in the dog-days will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and joins the great whale-fishery you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport in bespeaking his sea-outfit he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats straps to his canvas trowsers ah poor hay-seed how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale when thou art driven straps buttons and all down the throat of the tempest but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers cannibals and bumpkins to show her visitors not at all still new bedford is a queer place had it not been for us whalemen that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of labrador as it is parts of her back country are enough to frighten one they look so bony the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in in all new england it is a land of oil true enough but not like canaan a land also of corn and wine the streets do not run with milk nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs yet in spite of this nowhere in all america will you find more patrician-like houses parks and gardens more opulent than in new bedford whence came they how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion and your question will be answered yes all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the atlantic pacific and indian oceans one and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea can herr alexander perform a feat like that in new bedford fathers they say give whales for dowers to their daughters and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding for they say they have reservoirs of oil in every house and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles in summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine maples -- long avenues of green and gold and in august high in air the beautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts candelabra-wise proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms so omnipotent is art which in many a district of new bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation's final day and the women of new bedford they bloom like their own red roses but roses only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye cannot save in salem where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore as though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of the puritanic sands chapter 7 the chapel in this same new bedford there stands a whaleman's chapel and few are the moody fishermen shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot i am sure that i did not returning from my first morning stroll i again sallied out upon this special errand the sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving sleet and mist wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin i fought my way against the stubborn storm entering i found a small scattered congregation of sailors and sailors' wives and widows a muffled silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable the chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets with black borders masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit three of them ran something like the following but i do not pretend to quote -- sacred to the memory of john talbot who at the age of eighteen was lost overboard near the isle of desolation off patagonia november 1st 1836 this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister sacred to the memory of robert long willis ellery nathan coleman walter canny seth macy and samuel gleig forming one of the boats' crews of the ship eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale on the off-shore ground in the pacific december 31st 1839 this marble is here placed by their surviving shipmates sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy who in the bows of his boat was killed by a sperm whale on the coast of japan august 3d 1833 this tablet is erected to his memory by his widow shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket i seated myself near the door and turning sideways was surprised to see queequeg near me affected by the solemnity of the scene there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance this savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance because he was the only one who could not read and therefore was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation i knew not but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief that i feel sure that here before me were assembled those in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh oh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among flowers can say -- here here lies my beloved ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these what bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes what despair in those immovable inscriptions what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here in what census of living creatures the dead of mankind are included why it is that a universal proverb says of them that they tell no tales though containing more secrets than the goodwin sands how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world we prefix so significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle him if he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth why the life insurance companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals in what eternal unstirring paralysis and deadly hopeless trance yet lies antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss why all the living so strive to hush all the dead wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city all these things are not without their meanings but faith like a jackal feeds among the tombs and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope it needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of a nantucket voyage i regarded those marble tablets and by the murky light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me yes ishmael the same fate may be thine but somehow i grew merry again delightful inducements to embark fine chance for promotion it seems -- aye a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet yes there is death in this business of whaling -- a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity but what then methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air methinks my body is but the lees of my better being in fact take my body who will take it i say it is not me and therefore three cheers for nantucket and come a stove boat and stove body when they will for stave my soul jove himself cannot chapter 8 the pulpit i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain yes it was the famous father mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he was a very great favourite he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry at the time i now write of father mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth for among all the fissures of his wrinkles there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom -- the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath february's snow no one having previously heard his history could for the first time behold father mapple without the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella and certainly had not come in his carriage for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed however hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit he quietly approached the pulpit like most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and since a regular stairs to such a height would by its long angle with the floor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect it seemed had acted upon the hint of father mapple and finished the pulpit without a stairs substituting a perpendicular side ladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and stained with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance considering what manner of chapel it was seemed by no means in bad taste halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes father mapple cast a look upwards and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity hand over hand mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel the perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the case with swinging ones were of cloth-covered rope only the rounds were of wood so that at every step there was a joint at my first glimpse of the pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary for i was not prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly turn round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder step by step till the whole was deposited within leaving him impregnable in his little quebec i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage no thought i there must be some sober reason for this thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen can it be then that by that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly ties and connexions yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the word to the faithful man of god this pulpit i see is a self-containing stronghold -- a lofty ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the walls but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers but high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds there floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angel's face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship's tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into the victory's plank where nelson fell ah noble ship the angel seemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling off -- serenest azure is at hand nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship's bluff bows and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a ship's fiddle-headed beak what could be more full of meaning -- for the pulpit is ever this earth's foremost part all the rest comes in its rear the pulpit leads the world from thence it is the storm of god's quick wrath is first descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thence it is the god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds yes the world's a ship on its passage out and not a voyage complete and the pulpit is its prow chapter 9 the sermon father mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense starboard gangway there side away to larboard -- larboard gangway to starboard midships midships there was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches and a still slighter shuffling of women's shoes and all was quiet again and every eye on the preacher he paused a little then kneeling in the pulpit's bows folded his large brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea this ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog -- in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy -- the ribs and terrors in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom while all god's sun-lit waves rolled by and lift me deepening down to doom i saw the opening maw of hell with endless pains and sorrows there which none but they that feel can tell -- oh i was plunging to despair in black distress i called my god when i could scarce believe him mine he bowed his ear to my complaints -- no more the whale did me confine with speed he flew to my relief as on a radiant dolphin borne awful yet bright as lightning shone the face of my deliverer god my song for ever shall record that terrible that joyful hour i give the glory to my god his all the mercy and the power nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon the proper page said beloved shipmates clinch the last verse of the first chapter of jonah -- 'and god had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah ' shipmates this book containing only four chapters -- four yarns -- is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures yet what depths of the soul does jonah's deep sealine sound what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet what a noble thing is that canticle in the fish's belly how billow-like and boisterously grand we feel the floods surging over us we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us but what is this lesson that the book of jonah teaches shipmates it is a two-stranded lesson a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living god as sinful men it is a lesson to us all because it is a story of the sin hard-heartedness suddenly awakened fears the swift punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah as with all sinners among men the sin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of god -- never mind now what that command was or how conveyed -- which he found a hard command but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us to do -- remember that -- and hence he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade and if we obey god we must disobey ourselves and it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying god consists with this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further flouts at god by seeking to flee from him he thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where god does not reign but only the captains of this earth he skulks about the wharves of joppa and seeks a ship that's bound for tarshish there lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded meaning here by all accounts tarshish could have been no other city than the modern cadiz that's the opinion of learned men and where is cadiz shipmates cadiz is in spain as far by water from joppa as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the atlantic was an almost unknown sea because joppa the modern jaffa shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that just outside the straits of gibraltar see ye not then shipmates that jonah sought to flee world-wide from god miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas so disordered self-condemning is his look that had there been policemen in those days jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had been arrested ere he touched a deck how plainly he's a fugitive no baggage not a hat-box valise or carpet-bag -- no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux at last after much dodging search he finds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the stranger's evil eye jonah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence in vain essays his wretched smile strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent in their gamesome but still serious way one whispers to the other -- jack he's robbed a widow or joe do you mark him he's a bigamist or harry lad i guess he's the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike one of the missing murderers from sodom another runs to read the bill that's stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide and containing a description of his person he reads and looks from jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah prepared to lay their hands upon him frighted jonah trembles and summoning all his boldness to his face only looks so much the more a coward he will not confess himself suspected but that itself is strong suspicion so he makes the best of it and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised they let him pass and he descends into the cabin 'who's there ' cries the captain at his busy desk hurriedly making out his papers for the customs -- 'who's there ' oh how that harmless question mangles jonah for the instant he almost turns to flee again but he rallies 'i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon sail ye sir ' thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah though the man now stands before him but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance 'we sail with the next coming tide ' at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing him 'no sooner sir ' -- 'soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger ' ha jonah that's another stab but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent 'i'll sail with ye ' -- he says -- 'the passage money how much is that -- i'll pay now ' for it is particularly written shipmates as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history 'that he paid the fare thereof' ere the craft did sail and taken with the context this is full of meaning now jonah's captain shipmates was one whose discernment detects crime in any but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless in this world shipmates sin that pays its way can travel freely and without a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers so jonah's captain prepares to test the length of jonah's purse ere he judge him openly he charges him thrice the usual sum and it's assented to then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions still molest the captain he rings every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger any way he mutters and jonah is put down for his passage 'point out my state-room sir ' says jonah now 'i'm travel-weary i need sleep ' 'thou lookest like it ' says the captain 'there's thy room ' jonah enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no key hearing him foolishly fumbling there the captain laughs lowly to himself and mutters something about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked within all dressed and dusty as he is jonah throws himself into his berth and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead the air is close and jonah gasps then in that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ship's water-line jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels' wards screwed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in jonah's room and the ship heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received the lamp flame and all though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it but made obvious the false lying levels among which it hung the lamp alarms and frightens jonah as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance but that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him the floor the ceiling and the side are all awry 'oh so my conscience hangs in me ' he groans 'straight upwards so it burns but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness ' like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed still reeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of the roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as over the man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and there's naught to staunch it so after sore wrestlings in his berth jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep and now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening glides to sea that ship my friends was the first of recorded smugglers the contraband was jonah but the sea rebels he will not bear the wicked burden a dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to break but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her when boxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind is shrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over jonah's head in all this raging tumult jonah sleeps his hideous sleep he sees no black sky and raging sea feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship -- a berth in the cabin as i have taken it and was fast asleep but the frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear 'what meanest thou o sleeper arise ' startled from his lethargy by that direful cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to the deck grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks wave after wave thus leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat and ever as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul in all his cringing attitudes the god-fugitive is now too plainly known the sailors mark him more and more certain grow their suspicions of him and at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to high heaven they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them the lot is jonah's that discovered then how furiously they mob him with their questions 'what is thine occupation whence comest thou thy country what people but mark now my shipmates the behavior of poor jonah the eager mariners but ask him who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answer to those questions but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him 'i am a hebrew ' he cries -- and then -- 'i fear the lord the god of heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land ' fear him o jonah aye well mightest thou fear the lord god then straightway he now goes on to make a full confession whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicating god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts -- when wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howls louder then with one hand raised invokingly to god with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of jonah and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east and the sea is still as jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smooth water behind he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayed unto the lord out of the fish's belly but observe his prayer and learn a weighty lesson for sinful as he is jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment is just he leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards his holy temple and here shipmates is true and faithful repentance not clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing to god was this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale shipmates i do not place jonah before you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a model for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like jonah while he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who when describing jonah's sea-storm seemed tossed by a storm himself his deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them there now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over the leaves of the book once more and at last standing motionless with closed eyes for the moment seemed communing with god and himself but again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his head lowly with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake these words shipmates god has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press upon me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit and listen as you listen while some one of you reads me that other and more awful lesson which jonah teaches to me as a pilot of the living god how being an anointed pilot-prophet or speaker of true things and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached as we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him along 'into the midst of the seas ' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down and 'the weeds were wrapped about his head ' and all the watery world of woe bowled over him yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet -- 'out of the belly of hell' -- when the whale grounded upon the ocean's utmost bones even then god heard the engulphed repenting prophet when he cried then god spake unto the fish and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delights of air and earth and 'vomited out jonah upon the dry land ' when the word of the lord came a second time and jonah bruised and beaten -- his ears like two sea-shells still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean -- jonah did the almighty's bidding and what was that shipmates to preach the truth to the face of falsehood that was it this shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of the living god who slights it woe to him whom this world charms from gospel duty woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god has brewed them into a gale woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness woe to him who in this world courts not dishonour woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were salvation yea woe to him who as the great pilot paul has it while preaching to others is himself a castaway he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm -- but oh shipmates on the starboard hand of every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low delight is to him -- a far far upward and inward delight -- who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable self delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him delight is to him who gives no quarter in the truth and kills burns and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of senators and judges delight -- top-gallant delight is to him who acknowledges no law or lord but the lord his god and is only a patriot to heaven delight is to him whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the ages and eternal delight and deliciousness will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his final breath -- o father -- chiefly known to me by thy rod -- mortal or immortal here i die i have striven to be thine more than to be this world's or mine own yet this is nothing i leave eternity to thee for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his god he said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his face with his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed and he was left alone in the place chapter 10 a bosom friend returning to the spouter-inn from the chapel i found queequeg there quite alone he having left the chapel before the benediction some time he was sitting on a bench before the fire with his feet on the stove hearth and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with a jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth page -- as i fancied -- stopping a moment looking vacantly around him and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number one each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited with much interest i sat watching him savage though he was and hideously marred about the face -- at least to my taste -- his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable you cannot hide the soul through all his unearthly tattooings i thought i saw the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils and besides all this there was a certain lofty bearing about the pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor whether it was too that his head being shaved his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief and looked more expansive than it otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one it may seem ridiculous but it reminded me of general washington's head as seen in the popular busts of him it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows which were likewise very projecting like two long promontories thickly wooded on top queequeg was george washington cannibalistically developed whilst i was thus closely scanning him half-pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence never troubled himself with so much as a single glance but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning i thought this indifference of his very strange but savages are strange beings at times you do not know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom i had noticed also that queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the other seamen in the inn he made no advances whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances all this struck me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there was something almost sublime in it here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home by the way of cape horn that is -- which was the only way he could get there -- thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to himself surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that but perhaps to be true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher i conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he must have broken his digester as i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that mild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it then only glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements and peering in upon us silent solitary twain the storm booming without in solemn swells i began to be sensible of strange feelings i felt a melting in me no more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world this soothing savage had redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet i began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him and those same things that would have repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus drew me i'll try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy i drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs and hints doing my best to talk with him meanwhile at first he little noticed these advances but presently upon my referring to his last night's hospitalities he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows i told him yes whereat i thought he looked pleased perhaps a little complimented we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and producing his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff and then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keeping it regularly passing between us if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagan's breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left us cronies he seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his forehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were married meaning in his country's phrase that we were bosom friends he would gladly die for me if need should be in a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply after supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room together he made me a present of his embalmed head took out his enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out some thirty dollars in silver then spreading them on the table and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one of them towards me and said it was mine i was going to remonstrate but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers' pockets i let them stay he then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed the paper fireboard by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemed anxious for me to join him but well knowing what was to follow i deliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply or otherwise i was a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible presbyterian church how then could i unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i do you suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and earth -- pagans and all included -- can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worship -- to do the will of god -- that is worship and what is the will of god -- to do to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to me -- that is the will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish that this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particular presbyterian form of worship consequently i must then unite with him in his ergo i must turn idolator so i kindled the shavings helped prop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences and all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat how it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends man and wife they say there open the very bottom of their souls to each other and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning thus then in our hearts' honeymoon lay i and queequeg -- a cosy loving pair chapter 11 nightgown we had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals and queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and free and easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulations what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed and we felt like getting up again though day-break was yet some way down the future yes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up the clothes well tucked around us leaning against the head-board with our four knees drawn up close together and our two noses bending over them as if our kneepans were warming-pans we felt very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors indeed out of bed-clothes too seeing that there was no fire in the room the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself if you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more but if like queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich for the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all at once i thought i would open my eyes for when between sheets whether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a way of always keeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences though light be more congenial to our clayey part upon opening my eyes then and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night i experienced a disagreeable revulsion nor did i at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk be it said that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them for now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me even in bed because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord's policy of insurance i was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passed the tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes i know not but he now spoke of his native island and eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it he gladly complied though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his words yet subsequent disclosures when i had become more familiar with his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give chapter 12 biographical queequeg was a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and south it is not down in any map true places never are when a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a green sapling even then in queequeg's ambitious soul lurked a strong desire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two his father was a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors there was excellent blood in his veins -- royal stuff though sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth a sag harbor ship visited his father's bay and queequeg sought a passage to christian lands but the ship having her full complement of seamen spurned his suit and not all the king his father's influence could prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in his canoe he paddled off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island on one side was a coral reef on the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with its prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the ship was gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chains and throwing himself at full length upon the deck grappled a ring-bolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists queequeg was the son of a king and queequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented and told him he might make himself at home but this fine young savage -- this sea prince of wales never saw the captain's cabin they put him down among the sailors and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen for at bottom -- so he told me -- he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were and more than that still better than they were but alas the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be both miserable and wicked infinitely more so than all his father's heathens arrived at last in old sag harbor and seeing what the sailors did there and then going on to nantucket and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also poor queequeg gave it up for lost thought he it's a wicked world in all meridians i'll die a pagan and thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christians wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queer ways about him though now some time from home by hints i asked him whether he did not propose going back and having a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he being very old and feeble at the last accounts he answered no not yet and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christians had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him but by and by he said he would return -- as soon as he felt himself baptized again for the nonce however he proposed to sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans they had made a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future movements he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon this i told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from he at once resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap with both my hands in his boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds to all this i joyously assented for besides the affection i now felt for queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as such could not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling though well acquainted with the sea as known to merchant seamen his story being ended with his pipe's last dying puff queequeg embraced me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the light we rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were sleeping chapter 13 wheelbarrow next morning monday after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber for a block i settled my own and comrade's bill using however my comrade's money the grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and queequeg -- especially as peter coffin's cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom i now companied with we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my own poor carpet-bag and queequeg's canvas sack and hammock away we went down to the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf as we were going along the people stared not at queequeg so much -- for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets -- but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms but we heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs i asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons to this in substance he replied that though what i hinted was true enough yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales in short like many inland reapers and mowers who go into the farmers' meadows armed with their own scythes -- though in no wise obliged to furnish them -- even so queequeg for his own private reasons preferred his own harpoon shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it was in sag harbor the owners of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about the thing -- though in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow -- queequeg puts his chest upon it lashes it fast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf why said i queequeg you might have known better than that one would think didn't the people laugh upon this he told me another story the people of his island of rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko and its commander -- from all accounts a very stately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captain -- this commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequeg's sister a pretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo cottage this captain marches in and being assigned the post of honour placed himself over against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty the king queequeg's father grace being said -- for those people have their grace as well as we -- though queequeg told me that unlike us who at such times look downwards to our platters they on the contrary copying the ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all feasts -- grace i say being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates seeing himself placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking himself -- being captain of a ship -- as having plain precedence over a mere island king especially in the king's own house -- the captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl -- taking it i suppose for a huge finger-glass now said queequeg what you tink now -- didn't our people laugh at last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the schooner hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet river on one side new bedford rose in terraces of streets their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear cold air huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch all betokening that new cruises were on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begins a second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for ever and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all earthly effort gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings how i snuffed that tartar air -- how i spurned that turnpike earth -- that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records at the same foam-fountain queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me his dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to the blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan sideways leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes so full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by the plunging bowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers a lubber-like assembly who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro but there were some boobies and bumpkins there who by their intense greenness must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back i thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come dropping his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet while queequeg turning his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff capting capting yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer capting capting here's the devil hallo you sir cried the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking up to queequeg what in thunder do you mean by that don't you know you might have killed that chap what him say said queequeg as he mildly turned to me he say said i that you came near kill-e that man there pointing to the still shivering greenhorn kill-e cried queequeg twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain ah him bevy small-e fish-e queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e queequeg kill-e big whale look you roared the captain i'll kill-e you you cannibal if you try any more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eye but it so happened just then that it was high time for the captain to mind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck the poor fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all hands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness it flew from right to left and back again almost in one ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters nothing was done and nothing seemed capable of being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the midst of this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwarks and then flinging the other like a lasso caught it round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar was that way trapped and all was safe the schooner was run into the wind and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog throwing his long arms straight out before him and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam i looked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved the greenhorn had gone down shooting himself perpendicularly from the water queequeg now took an instant's glance around him and seeming to see just how matters were dived down and disappeared a few minutes more and he rose again one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form the boat soon picked them up the poor bumpkin was restored all hands voted queequeg a noble trump the captain begged his pardon from that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle yea till poor queequeg took his last long dive was there ever such unconsciousness he did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies he only asked for water -- fresh water -- something to wipe the brine off that done he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the bulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be saying to himself -- it's a mutual joint-stock world in all meridians we cannibals must help these christians chapter 14 nantucket nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a fine run we safely arrived in nantucket nantucket take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of the world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse look at it -- a mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background there is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there they don't grow naturally that they import canada thistles that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that pieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in rome that people there plant toadstools before their houses to get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass makes an oasis three blades in a day's walk a prairie that they wear quicksand shoes something like laplander snow-shoes that they are so shut up belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island of by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles but these extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the red-men thus goes the legend in olden times an eagle swooped down upon the new england coast and carried off an infant indian in his talons with loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters they resolved to follow in the same direction setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage they discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casket -- the poor little indian's skeleton what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should take to the sea for a livelihood they first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand grown bolder they waded out with nets for mackerel more experienced they pushed off in boats and captured cod and at last launching a navy of great ships on the sea explored this watery world put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it peeped in at behring's straits and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan salt-sea mastodon clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults and thus have these naked nantucketers these sea hermits issuing from their ant-hill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery world like so many alexanders parcelling out among them the atlantic pacific and indian oceans as the three pirate powers did poland let america add mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english overswarm all india and hang out their blazing banner from the sun two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketer's for the sea is his he owns it as emperors own empires other seamen having but a right of way through it merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but floating forts even pirates and privateers though following the sea as highwaymen the road they but plunder other ships other fragments of the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself the nantucketer he alone resides and riots on the sea he alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation there is his home there lies his business which a noah's flood would not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the millions in china he lives on the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the alps for years he knows not the land so that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales chapter 15 chowder it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor and queequeg and i went ashore so we could attend to no business that day at least none but a supper and a bed the landlord of the spouter-inn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all nantucket and moreover he had assured us that cousin hosea as he called him was famous for his chowders in short he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the try pots but the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard and that done then ask the first man we met where the place was these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first especially as at the outset queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse -- our first point of departure -- must be left on the larboard hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to say it was on the starboard however by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we at last came to something which there was no mistaking two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses' ears swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast planted in front of an old doorway the horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but i could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort of crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns yes two of them one for queequeg and one for me it's ominous thinks i a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port tombstones staring at me in the whalemen's chapel and here a gallows and a pair of prodigious black pots too are these last throwing out oblique hints touching tophet i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt get along with ye said she to the man or i'll be combing ye come on queequeg said i all right there's mrs hussey and so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving mrs hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed mrs hussey postponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a little room and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast turned round to us and said -- clam or cod what's that about cods ma'am said i with much politeness clam or cod she repeated a clam for supper a cold clam is that what you mean mrs hussey says i but that's a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time ain't it mrs hussey but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing but the word clam mrs hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappeared queequeg said i do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam however a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us but when that smoking chowder came in the mystery was delightfully explained oh sweet friends hearken to me it was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut up into little flakes the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of mrs hussey's clam and cod announcement i thought i would try a little experiment stepping to the kitchen door i uttered the word cod with great emphasis and resumed my seat in a few moments the savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us we resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks i to myself i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head what's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people but look queequeg ain't that a live eel in your bowl where's your harpoon fishiest of all fishy places was the try pots which well deserved its name for the pots there were always boiling chowders chowder for breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes the area before the house was paved with clam-shells mrs hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin there was a fishy flavor to the milk too which i could not at all account for till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen's boats i saw hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod's decapitated head looking very slip-shod i assure ye supper concluded we received a lamp and directions from mrs hussey concerning the nearest way to bed but as queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers why not said i every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon -- but why not because it's dangerous says she ever since young stiggs coming from that unfort'nt v'y'ge of his when he was gone four years and a half with only three barrels of ile was found dead in my first floor back with his harpoon in his side ever since then i allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night so mr queequeg for she had learned his name i will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morning but the chowder clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast men both says i and let's have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety chapter 16 the ship in bed we concocted our plans for the morrow but to my surprise and no small concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been diligently consulting yojo -- the name of his black little god -- and yojo had told him two or three times over and strongly insisted upon it everyway that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this i say yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us and in order to do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself i ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as though it had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately ship myself for the present irrespective of queequeg i have forgotten to mention that in many things queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of yojo's judgment and surprising forecast of things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs now this plan of queequeg's or rather yojo's touching the selection of our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a little relied upon queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely but as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon queequeg i was obliged to acquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our little bedroom -- for it seemed that it was some sort of lent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with queequeg and yojo that day how it was i never could find out for though i applied myself to it several times i never could master his liturgies and xxxix articles -- leaving queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings i sallied out among the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries i learnt that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages -- the devil-dam the tit-bit and the pequod devil-dam i do not know the origin of tit-bit is obvious pequod you will no doubt remember was the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct as the ancient medes i peered and pryed about the devil-dam from her hopped over to the tit-bit and finally going on board the pequod looked around her for a moment and then decided that this was the very ship for us you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught i know -- square-toed luggers mountainous japanese junks butter-box galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old pequod she was a ship of the old school rather small if anything with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans her old hull's complexion was darkened like a french grenadier's who has alike fought in egypt and siberia her venerable bows looked bearded her masts -- cut somewhere on the coast of japan where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale -- her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled but to all these her old antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed old captain peleg many years her chief-mate before he commanded another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the principal owners of the pequod -- this old peleg during the term of his chief-mateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched by anything except it be thorkill-hake's carved buckler or bedstead she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory she was a thing of trophies a cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies all round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw a noble craft but somehow a most melancholy all noble things are touched with that now when i looked about the quarter-deck for some one having authority in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage at first i saw nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the main-mast it seemed only a temporary erection used in port it was of a conical shape some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old pottowottamie sachem's head a triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded a complete view forward and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and the ship's work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of command he was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed there was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of the elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth cut in the quaker style only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales and always looking to windward -- for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl is this the captain of the pequod said i advancing to the door of the tent supposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want of him he demanded i was thinking of shipping thou wast wast thou i see thou art no nantucketer -- ever been in a stove boat no sir i never have dost know nothing at all about whaling i dare say -- eh nothing sir but i have no doubt i shall soon learn i've been several voyages in the merchant service and i think that -- merchant service be damned talk not that lingo to me dost see that leg -- i'll take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again marchant service indeed i suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships but flukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling eh -- it looks a little suspicious don't it eh -- hast not been a pirate hast thou -- didst not rob thy last captain didst thou -- dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea i protested my innocence of these things i saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes this old seaman as an insulated quakerish nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and rather distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard but what takes thee a-whaling i want to know that before i think of shipping ye well sir i want to see what whaling is i want to see the world want to see what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahab who is captain ahab sir aye aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this ship i am mistaken then i thought i was speaking to the captain himself thou art speaking to captain peleg -- that's who ye are speaking to young man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew we are part owners and agents but as i was going to say if thou wantest to know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out clap eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only one leg what do you mean sir was the other one lost by a whale lost by a whale young man come nearer to me it was devoured chewed up crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat -- ah ah i was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as i could what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could i know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident look ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft d'ye see thou dost not talk shark a bit sure ye've been to sea before now sure of that sir said i i thought i told you that i had been four voyages in the merchant -- hard down out of that mind what i said about the marchant service -- don't aggravate me -- i won't have it but let us understand each other i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel inclined for it i do sir very good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale's throat and then jump after it answer quick i am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to be got rid of that is which i don't take to be the fact good again now then thou not only wantest to go a-whaling to find out by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order to see the world was not that what ye said i thought so well then just step forward there and take a peep over the weather-bow and then back to me and tell me what ye see there for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not knowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest but concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl captain peleg started me on the errand going forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean the prospect was unlimited but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that i could see well what's the report said peleg when i came back what did ye see not much i replied -- nothing but water considerable horizon though and there's a squall coming up i think well what does thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish to go round cape horn to see any more of it eh can't ye see the world where you stand i was a little staggered but go a-whaling i must and i would and the pequod was as good a ship as any -- i thought the best -- and all this i now repeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness to ship me and thou mayest as well sign the papers right off he added -- come along with ye and so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure it turned out to be captain bildad who along with captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the other shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowd of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards each owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest now bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers was a quaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters they are fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance so that there are instances among them of men who named with scripture names -- a singularly common fashion on the island -- and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character not unworthy a scandinavian sea-king or a poetical pagan roman and when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain and a ponderous heart who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters and beneath constellations never seen here at the north been led to think untraditionally and independently receiving all nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental advantages to learn a bold and nervous lofty language -- that man makes one in a whole nation's census -- a mighty pageant creature formed for noble tragedies nor will it at all detract from him dramatically regarded if either by birth or other circumstances he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature for all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness be sure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease but as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from another phase of the quaker modified by individual circumstances like captain peleg captain bildad was a well-to-do retired whaleman but unlike captain peleg -- who cared not a rush for what are called serious things and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles -- captain bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island creatures round the horn -- all that had not moved this native born quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angle of his vest still for all this immutableness was there some lack of common consistency about worthy captain peleg though refusing from conscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed yet had he in his straight-bodied coat spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative evening of his days the pious bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence i do not know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's religion is one thing and this practical world quite another this world pays dividends rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat from that becoming boat-header chief-mate and captain and finally a ship owner bildad as i hinted before had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income now bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks and in his sea-going days a bitter hard task-master they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when he sailed the old categut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for a quaker he was certainly rather hard-hearted to say the least he never used to swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them when bildad was a chief-mate to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutch something -- a hammer or a marling-spike and go to work like mad at something or other never mind what indolence and idleness perished before him his own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character on his long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh no superfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat such then was the person that i saw seated on the transom when i followed captain peleg down into the cabin the space between the decks was small and there bolt-upright sat old bildad who always sat so and never leaned and this to save his coat tails his broad-brim was placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume bildad cried captain peleg at it again bildad eh ye have been studying those scriptures now for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge how far ye got bildad as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate bildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked up and seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleg he says he's our man bildad said peleg he wants to ship dost thee said bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me i dost said i unconsciously he was so intense a quaker what do ye think of him bildad said peleg he'll do said bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially as peleg his friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i said nothing only looking round me sharply peleg now threw open a chest and drawing forth the ship's articles placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table i began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for the voyage i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages but all hands including the captain received certain shares of the profits called lays and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's company i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my own lay would not be very large but considering that i was used to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275th lay -- that is the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually amount to and though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay yet it was better than nothing and if we had a lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it not to speak of my three years' beef and board for which i would not have to pay one stiver it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune -- and so it was a very poor way indeed but i am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me while i am putting up at this grim sign of the thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had i been offered the 200th considering i was of a broad-shouldered make but one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this ashore i had heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two and i did not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands especially as i now found him on board the pequod quite at home there in the cabin and reading his bible as if at his own fireside now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife old bildad to my no small surprise considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings bildad never heeded us but went on mumbling to himself out of his book lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth -- well captain bildad interrupted peleg what d'ye say what lay shall we give this young man thou knowest best was the sepulchral reply the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much would it -- 'where moth and rust do corrupt but lay -- ' lay indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred and seventy-seventh well old bildad you are determined that i for one shall not lay up many lays here below where moth and rust do corrupt it was an exceedingly long lay that indeed and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number yet when you come to make a teenth of it you will then see i say that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons and so i thought at the time why blast your eyes bildad cried peleg thou dost not want to swindle this young man he must have more than that seven hundred and seventy-seventh again said bildad without lifting his eyes and then went on mumbling -- for where your treasure is there will your heart be also i am going to put him down for the three hundredth said peleg do ye hear that bildad the three hundredth lay i say bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship -- widows and orphans many of them -- and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans the seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay captain peleg thou bildad roared peleg starting up and clattering about the cabin blast ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these matters i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn captain peleg said bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water or ten fathoms i can't tell but as thou art still an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit captain peleg fiery pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye insult me it's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he's bound to hell flukes and flames bildad say that again to me and start my soul-bolts but i'll -- i'll -- yes i'll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on out of the cabin ye canting drab-coloured son of a wooden gun -- a straight wake with ye as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad but with a marvellous oblique sliding celerity bildad for that time eluded him alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad who i made no doubt was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg but to my astonishment he sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways as for peleg after letting off his rage as he had there seemed no more left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated whew he whistled at last -- the squall's gone off to leeward i think bildad thou used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jack-knife here needs the grindstone that's he thank ye bildad now then my young man ishmael's thy name didn't ye say well then down ye go here ishmael for the three hundredth lay captain peleg said i i have a friend with me who wants to ship too -- shall i bring him down to-morrow to be sure said peleg fetch him along and we'll look at him what lay does he want groaned bildad glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself oh never thee mind about that bildad said peleg has he ever whaled it any turning to me killed more whales than i can count captain peleg well bring him along then and after signing the papers off i went nothing doubting but that i had done a good morning's work and that the pequod was the identical ship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape but i had not proceeded far when i began to bethink me that the captain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me though indeed in many cases a whale-ship will be completely fitted out and receive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have a family or any absorbing concernment of that sort he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea however it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands turning back i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain ahab was to be found and what dost thou want of captain ahab it's all right enough thou art shipped yes but i should like to see him but i don't think thou wilt be able to at present i don't know exactly what's the matter with him but he keeps close inside the house a sort of sick and yet he don't look so in fact he ain't sick but no he isn't well either any how young man he won't always see me so i don't suppose he will thee he's a queer man captain ahab -- so some think -- but a good one oh thou'lt like him well enough no fear no fear he's a grand ungodly god-like man captain ahab doesn't speak much but when he does speak then you may well listen mark ye be forewarned ahab's above the common ahab's been in colleges as well as 'mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales his lance aye the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle oh he ain't captain bildad no and he ain't captain peleg he's ahab boy and ahab of old thou knowest was a crowned king and a very vile one when that wicked king was slain the dogs did they not lick his blood come hither to me -- hither hither said peleg with a significance in his eye that almost startled me look ye lad never say that on board the pequod never say it anywhere captain ahab did not name himself 'twas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who died when he was only a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig at gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic and perhaps other fools like her may tell thee the same i wish to warn thee it's a lie i know captain ahab well i've sailed with him as mate years ago i know what he is -- a good man -- not a pious good man like bildad but a swearing good man -- something like me -- only there's a good deal more of him aye aye i know that he was never very jolly and i know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about as any one might see i know too that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale he's been a kind of moody -- desperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pass off and once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young man it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one so good-bye to thee -- and wrong not captain ahab because he happens to have a wicked name besides my boy he has a wife -- not three voyages wedded -- a sweet resigned girl think of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in ahab no no my lad stricken blasted if he be ahab has his humanities as i walked away i was full of thoughtfulness what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him and somehow at the time i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i don't know what unless it was the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strange awe of him but that sort of awe which i cannot at all describe was not exactly awe i do not know what it was but i felt it and it did not disincline me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him so imperfectly as he was known to me then however my thoughts were at length carried in other directions so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind chapter 17 the ramadan as queequeg's ramadan or fasting and humiliation was to continue all day i did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall for i cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious obligations never mind how comical and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name i say we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these things and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals pagans and what not because of their half-crazy conceits on these subjects there was queequeg now certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about yojo and his ramadan -- but what of that queequeg thought he knew what he was about i suppose he seemed to be content and there let him rest all our arguing with him would not avail let him be i say and heaven have mercy on us all -- presbyterians and pagans alike -- for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need mending towards evening when i felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over i went up to his room and knocked at the door but no answer i tried to open it but it was fastened inside queequeg said i softly through the key-hole -- all silent i say queequeg why don't you speak it's i -- ishmael but all remained still as before i began to grow alarmed i had allowed him such abundant time i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit i looked through the key-hole but the door opening into an odd corner of the room the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one i could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing more i was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of queequeg's harpoon which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him before our mounting to the chamber that's strange thought i but at any rate since the harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or never goes abroad without it therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistake queequeg -- queequeg -- all still something must have happened apoplexy i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted running down stairs i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person i met -- the chamber-maid la la she cried i thought something must be the matter i went to make the bed after breakfast and the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard and it's been just so silent ever since but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping la la ma'am -- mistress murder mrs hussey apoplexy -- and with these cries she ran towards the kitchen i following mrs hussey soon appeared with a mustard-pot in one hand and a vinegar-cruet in the other having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors and scolding her little black boy meantime wood-house cried i which way to it run for god's sake and fetch something to pry open the door -- the axe -- the axe he's had a stroke depend upon it -- and so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty-handed when mrs hussey interposed the mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet and the entire castor of her countenance what's the matter with you young man get the axe for god's sake run for the doctor some one while i pry it open look here said the landlady quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet so as to have one hand free look here are you talking about prying open any of my doors -- and with that she seized my arm what's the matter with you what's the matter with you shipmate in as calm but rapid a manner as possible i gave her to understand the whole case unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimed -- no i haven't seen it since i put it there running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs she glanced in and returning told me that queequeg's harpoon was missing he's killed himself she cried it's unfort'nate stiggs done over again there goes another counterpane -- god pity his poor mother -- it will be the ruin of my house has the poor lad a sister where's that girl -- there betty go to snarles the painter and tell him to paint me a sign with -- no suicides permitted here and no smoking in the parlor -- might as well kill both birds at once kill the lord be merciful to his ghost what's that noise there you young man avast there and running up after me she caught me as i was again trying to force open the door i don't allow it i won't have my premises spoiled go for the locksmith there's one about a mile from here but avast putting her hand in her side-pocket here's a key that'll fit i guess let's see and with that she turned it in the lock but alas queequeg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within have to burst it open said i and was running down the entry a little for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing i should not break down her premises but i tore from her and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark with a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slamming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there good heavens there sat queequeg altogether cool and self-collected right in the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding yojo on top of his head he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life queequeg said i going up to him queequeg what's the matter with you he hain't been a sittin' so all day has he said the landlady but all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt like pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almost intolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained especially as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours going too without his regular meals mrs hussey said i he's alive at all events so leave us if you please and i will see to this strange affair myself closing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to prevail upon queequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all he could do -- for all my polite arts and blandishments -- he would not move a peg nor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in the slightest way i wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan do they fast on their hams that way in his native island it must be so yes it's part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest he'll get up sooner or later no doubt it can't last for ever thank god and his ramadan only comes once a year and i don't believe it's very punctual then i went down to supper after sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage as they called it that is a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig confined to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean only after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o'clock i went up stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time queequeg must certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination but no there he was just where i had left him he had not stirred an inch i began to grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room holding a piece of wood on his head for heaven's sake queequeg get up and shake yourself get up and have some supper you'll starve you'll kill yourself queequeg but not a word did he reply despairing of him therefore i determined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt before a great while he would follow me but previous to turning in i took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on for some time do all i would i could not get into the faintest doze i had blown out the candle and the mere thought of queequeg -- not four feet off -- sitting there in that uneasy position stark alone in the cold and dark this made me really wretched think of it sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary unaccountable ramadan but somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more till break of day when looking over the bedside there squatted queequeg as if he had been screwed down to the floor but as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints but with a cheerful look limped towards me where i lay pressed his forehead again against mine and said his ramadan was over now as i before hinted i have no objection to any person's religion be it what it may so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person because that other person don't believe it also but when a man's religion becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment to him and in fine makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in then i think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him and just so i now did with queequeg queequeg said i get into bed now and lie and listen to me i then went on beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions and coming down to the various religions of the present time during which time i labored to show queequeg that all these lents ramadans and prolonged ham-squattings in cold cheerless rooms were stark nonsense bad for the health useless for the soul opposed in short to the obvious laws of hygiene and common sense i told him too that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badly pained me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan of his besides argued i fasting makes the body cave in hence the spirit caves in and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved this is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters in one word queequeg said i rather digressively hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it in he said no only upon one memorable occasion it was after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening no more queequeg said i shuddering that will do for i knew the inferences without his further hinting them i had seen a sailor who had visited that very island and he told me that it was the custom when a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they were placed in great wooden trenchers and garnished round like a pilau with breadfruit and cocoanuts and with some parsley in their mouths were sent round with the victor's compliments to all his friends just as though these presents were so many christmas turkeys after all i do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon queequeg because in the first place he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless considered from his own point of view and in the second place he did not more than one third understand me couch my ideas simply as i would and finally he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than i did he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety at last we rose and dressed and queequeg taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board the pequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut bones chapter 18 his mark as we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg carrying his harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft unless they previously produced their papers what do you mean by that captain peleg said i now jumping on the bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf i mean he replied he must show his papers yes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from behind peleg's out of the wigwam he must show that he's converted son of darkness he added turning to queequeg art thou at present in communion with any christian church why said i he's a member of the first congregational church here be it said that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches first congregational church cried bildad what that worships in deacon deuteronomy coleman's meeting-house and so saying taking out his spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the wigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks took a good long look at queequeg how long hath he been a member he then said turning to me not very long i rather guess young man no said peleg and he hasn't been baptized right either or it would have washed some of that devil's blue off his face do tell now cried bildad is this philistine a regular member of deacon deuteronomy's meeting i never saw him going there and i pass it every lord's day i don't know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting said i all i know is that queequeg here is a born member of the first congregational church he is a deacon himself queequeg is young man said bildad sternly thou art skylarking with me -- explain thyself thou young hittite what church dost thee mean answer me finding myself thus hard pushed i replied i mean sir the same ancient catholic church to which you and i and captain peleg there and queequeg here and all of us and every mother's son and soul of us belong the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in that we all join hands splice thou mean'st splice hands cried peleg drawing nearer young man you'd better ship for a missionary instead of a fore-mast hand i never heard a better sermon deacon deuteronomy -- why father mapple himself couldn't beat it and he's reckoned something come aboard come aboard never mind about the papers i say tell quohog there -- what's that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great anchor what a harpoon he's got there looks like good stuff that and he handles it about right i say quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat did you ever strike a fish without saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way as this -- cap'ain you see him small drop tar on water dere you see him well spose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over old bildad's broad brim clean across the ship's decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight now said queequeg quietly hauling in the line spos-ee him whale-e eye why dad whale dead quick bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway quick i say you bildad and get the ship's papers we must have hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boats look ye quohog we'll give ye the ninetieth lay and that's more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of nantucket so down we went into the cabin and to my great joy queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship's company to which i myself belonged when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for signing he turned to me and said i guess quohog there don't know how to write does he i say quohog blast ye dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark but at this question queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies looked no ways abashed but taking the offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm so that through captain peleg's obstinate mistake touching his appellative it stood something like this -- quohog his x mark meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts and selecting one entitled the latter day coming or no time to lose placed it in queequeg's hands and then grasping them and the book with both his looked earnestly into his eyes and said son of darkness i must do my duty by thee i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways which i sadly fear i beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman spurn the idol bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye i say oh goodness gracious steer clear of the fiery pit something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildad's language heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases avast there avast there bildad avast now spoiling our harpooneer peleg pious harpooneers never make good voyagers -- it takes the shark out of 'em no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish there was young nat swaine once the bravest boat-header out of all nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting and never came to good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of after-claps in case he got stove and went to davy jones peleg peleg said bildad lifting his eyes and hands thou thyself as i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what it is to have the fear of death how then can'st thou prate in this ungodly guise thou beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on japan that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab did'st thou not think of death and the judgment then hear him hear him now cried peleg marching across the cabin and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets -- hear him all of ye think of that when every moment we thought the ship would sink death and the judgment then what with all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breaking over us fore and aft think of death and the judgment then no no time to think about death then life was what captain ahab and i was thinking of and how to save all hands -- how to rig jury-masts -- how to get into the nearest port that was what i was thinking of bildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck where we followed him there he stood very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted chapter 19 the prophet shipmates have ye shipped in that ship queequeg and i had just left the pequod and were sauntering away from the water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when the above words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before us levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question he was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck a confluent small-pox had in all directions flowed over his face and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters have been dried up have ye shipped in her he repeated you mean the ship pequod i suppose said i trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him aye the pequod -- that ship there he said drawing back his whole arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object yes said i we have just signed the articles anything down there about your souls about what oh perhaps you hav'n't got any he said quickly no matter though i know many chaps that hav'n't got any -- good luck to 'em and they are all the better off for it a soul's a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon what are you jabbering about shipmate said i he's got enough though to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps abruptly said the stranger placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he queequeg said i let's go this fellow has broken loose from somewhere he's talking about something and somebody we don't know stop cried the stranger ye said true -- ye hav'n't seen old thunder yet have ye who's old thunder said i again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner captain ahab what the captain of our ship the pequod aye among some of us old sailor chaps he goes by that name ye hav'n't seen him yet have ye no we hav'n't he's sick they say but is getting better and will be all right again before long all right again before long laughed the stranger with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh look ye when captain ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right not before what do you know about him what did they tell you about him say that they didn't tell much of anything about him only i've heard that he's a good whale-hunter and a good captain to his crew that's true that's true -- yes both true enough but you must jump when he gives an order step and growl growl and go -- that's the word with captain ahab but nothing about that thing that happened to him off cape horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altar in santa -- heard nothing about that eh nothing about the silver calabash he spat into and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage according to the prophecy didn't ye hear a word about them matters and something more eh no i don't think ye did how could ye who knows it not all nantucket i guess but hows'ever mayhap ye've heard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that i dare say oh yes that every one knows a'most -- i mean they know he's only one leg and that a parmacetti took the other off my friend said i what all this gibberish of yours is about i don't know and i don't much care for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head but if you are speaking of captain ahab of that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i know all about the loss of his leg all about it eh -- sure you do -- all pretty sure with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the beggar-like stranger stood a moment as if in a troubled reverie then starting a little turned and said -- ye've shipped have ye names down on the papers well well what's signed is signed and what's to be will be and then again perhaps it won't be after all anyhow it's all fixed and arranged a'ready and some sailors or other must go with him i suppose as well these as any other men god pity 'em morning to ye shipmates morning the ineffable heavens bless ye i'm sorry i stopped ye look here friend said i if you have anything important to tell us out with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle us you are mistaken in your game that's all i have to say and it's said very well and i like to hear a chap talk up that way you are just the man for him -- the likes of ye morning to ye shipmates morning oh when ye get there tell 'em i've concluded not to make one of 'em ah my dear fellow you can't fool us that way -- you can't fool us it is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him morning to ye shipmates morning morning it is said i come along queequeg let's leave this crazy man but stop tell me your name will you elijah elijah thought i and we walked away both commenting after each other's fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards when chancing to turn a corner and looking back as i did so who should be seen but elijah following us though at a distance somehow the sight of him struck me so that i said nothing to queequeg of his being behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did he did and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine this circumstance coupled with his ambiguous half-hinting half-revealing shrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions and all connected with the pequod and captain ahab and the leg he had lost and the cape horn fit and the silver calabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the ship the day previous and the prediction of the squaw tistig and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred other shadowy things i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg and on that side of it retraced our steps but elijah passed on without seeming to notice us this relieved me and once more and finally as it seemed to me i pronounced him in my heart a humbug chapter 20 all astir a day or two passed and there was great activity aboard the pequod not only were the old sails being mended but new sails were coming on board and bolts of canvas and coils of rigging in short everything betokened that the ship's preparations were hurrying to a close captain peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall on the day following queequeg's signing the articles word was given at all the inns where the ship's company were stopping that their chests must be on board before night for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing so queequeg and i got down our traps resolving however to sleep ashore till the last but it seems they always give very long notice in these cases and the ship did not sail for several days but no wonder there was a good deal to be done and there is no telling how many things to be thought of before the pequod was fully equipped every one knows what a multitude of things -- beds sauce-pans knives and forks shovels and tongs napkins nut-crackers and what not are indispensable to the business of housekeeping just so with whaling which necessitates a three-years' housekeeping upon the wide ocean far from all grocers costermongers doctors bakers and bankers and though this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen for besides the great length of the whaling voyage the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented it must be remembered that of all ships whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends hence the spare boats spare spars and spare lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost but a spare captain and duplicate ship at the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storage of the pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water fuel and iron hoops and staves but as before hinted for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things both large and small chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captain bildad's sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if she could help it nothing should be found wanting in the pequod after once fairly getting to sea at one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward's pantry another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate's desk where he kept his log a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one's rheumatic back never did any woman better deserve her name which was charity -- aunt charity as everybody called her and like a sister of charity did this charitable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety comfort and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother bildad was concerned and in which she herself owned a score or two of well-saved dollars but it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on board as she did the last day with a long oil-ladle in one hand and a still longer whaling lance in the other nor was bildad himself nor captain peleg at all backward as for bildad he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper every once in a while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den roaring at the men down the hatchways roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam during these days of preparation queequeg and i often visited the craft and as often i asked about captain ahab and how he was and when he was going to come on board his ship to these questions they would answer that he was getting better and better and was expected aboard every day meantime the two captains peleg and bildad could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage if i had been downright honest with myself i would have seen very plainly in my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea but when a man suspects any wrong it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself and much this way it was with me i said nothing and tried to think nothing at last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail so next morning queequeg and i took a very early start chapter 21 going aboard it was nearly six o'clock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we drew nigh the wharf there are some sailors running ahead there if i see right said i to queequeg it can't be shadows she's off by sunrise i guess come on avast cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming close behind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and then insinuating himself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely peering from queequeg to me it was elijah going aboard hands off will you said i lookee here said queequeg shaking himself go 'way ain't going aboard then yes we are said i but what business is that of yours do you know mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinent no no no i wasn't aware of that said elijah slowly and wonderingly looking from me to queequeg with the most unaccountable glances elijah said i you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing we are going to the indian and pacific oceans and would prefer not to be detained ye be be ye coming back afore breakfast he's cracked queequeg said i come on holloa cried stationary elijah hailing us when we had removed a few paces never mind him said i queequeg come on but he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder said -- did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago struck by this plain matter-of-fact question i answered saying yes i thought i did see four or five men but it was too dim to be sure very dim very dim said elijah morning to ye once more we quitted him but once more he came softly after us and touching my shoulder again said see if you can find 'em now will ye find who morning to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off oh i was going to warn ye against -- but never mind never mind -- it's all one all in the family too -- sharp frost this morning ain't it good-bye to ye shan't see ye again very soon i guess unless it's before the grand jury and with these cracked words he finally departed leaving me for the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence at last stepping on board the pequod we found everything in profound quiet not a soul moving the cabin entrance was locked within the hatches were all on and lumbered with coils of rigging going forward to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing a light we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket he was thrown at whole length upon two chests his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms the profoundest slumber slept upon him those sailors we saw queequeg where can they have gone to said i looking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when on the wharf queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter were it not for elijah's otherwise inexplicable question but i beat the thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body telling him to establish himself accordingly he put his hand upon the sleeper's rear as though feeling if it was soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly down there gracious queequeg don't sit there said i oh perry dood seat said queequeg my country way won't hurt him face face said i call that his face very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes he's heaving himself get off queequeg you are heavy it's grinding the face of the poor get off queequeg look he'll twitch you off soon i wonder he don't wake queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the feet we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile upon questioning him in his broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in his land owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts the king chiefs and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows and lay them round in the piers and alcoves besides it was very convenient on an excursion much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into walking-sticks upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps in some damp marshy place while narrating these things every time queequeg received the tomahawk from me he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper's head what's that for queequeg perry easy kill-e oh perry easy he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe which it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger the strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole it began to tell upon him he breathed with a sort of muffledness then seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and rubbed his eyes holloa he breathed at last who be ye smokers shipped men answered i when does she sail aye aye ye are going in her be ye she sails to-day the captain came aboard last night what captain -- ahab who but him indeed i was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab when we heard a noise on deck holloa starbuck's astir said the rigger he's a lively chief mate that good man and a pious but all alive now i must turn to and so saying he went on deck and we followed it was now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in twos and threes the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were actively engaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin chapter 22 merry christmas at length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ship's riggers and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf and after the ever-thoughtful charity had come off in a whale-boat with her last gift -- a night-cap for stubb the second mate her brother-in-law and a spare bible for the steward -- after all this the two captains peleg and bildad issued from the cabin and turning to the chief mate peleg said now mr starbuck are you sure everything is right captain ahab is all ready -- just spoke to him -- nothing more to be got from shore eh well call all hands then muster 'em aft here -- blast 'em no need of profane words however great the hurry peleg said bildad but away with thee friend starbuck and do our bidding how now here upon the very point of starting for the voyage captain peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter-deck just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea as well as to all appearances in port and as for captain ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin but then the idea was that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea indeed as that was not at all his proper business but the pilot's and as he was not yet completely recovered -- so they said -- therefore captain ahab stayed below and all this seemed natural enough especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends before they quit the ship for good with the pilot but there was not much chance to think over the matter for captain peleg was now all alive he seemed to do most of the talking and commanding and not bildad aft here ye sons of bachelors he cried as the sailors lingered at the main-mast mr starbuck drive'em aft strike the tent there -- was the next order as i hinted before this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor man the capstan blood and thunder -- jump -- was the next command and the crew sprang for the handspikes now in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with peleg be it known in addition to his other officers was one of the licensed pilots of the port -- he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned in for he never piloted any other craft -- bildad i say might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley with hearty good will nevertheless not three days previous bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod particularly in getting under weigh and charity his sister had placed a small choice copy of watts in each seaman's berth meantime overseeing the other part of the ship captain peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i paused on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking of the perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot i was comforting myself however with the thought that in pious bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity that was my first kick is that the way they heave in the marchant service he roared spring thou sheep-head spring and break thy backbone why don't ye spring i say all of ye -- spring quohog spring thou chap with the red whiskers spring there scotch-cap spring thou green pants spring i say all of ye and spring your eyes out and so saying he moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while imperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody thinks i captain peleg must have been drinking something to-day at last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we glided it was a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merged into night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor the long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving icicles depended from the bows lank bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon as the old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shivering frost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady notes were heard -- sweet fields beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living green so to the jews old canaan stood while jordan rolled between never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then they were full of hope and fruition spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer at last we gained such an offing that the two pilots were needed no longer the stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside it was curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad were affected at this juncture especially captain bildad for loath to depart yet very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage -- beyond both stormy capes a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested a ship in which an old shipmate sailed as captain a man almost as old as he once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him -- poor old bildad lingered long paced the deck with anxious strides ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck and looked to windward looked towards the wide and endless waters only bounded by the far-off unseen eastern continents looked towards the land looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding up a lantern for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face as much as to say nevertheless friend peleg i can stand it yes i can as for peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for all his philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near and he too did not a little run from cabin to deck -- now a word below and now a word with starbuck the chief mate but at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of look about him -- captain bildad -- come old shipmate we must go back the main-yard there boat ahoy stand by to come close alongside now careful careful -- come bildad boy -- say your last luck to ye starbuck -- luck to ye mr stubb -- luck to ye mr flask -- good-bye and good luck to ye all -- and this day three years i'll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old nantucket hurrah and away god bless ye and have ye in his holy keeping men murmured old bildad almost incoherently i hope ye'll have fine weather now so that captain ahab may soon be moving among ye -- a pleasant sun is all he needs and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go be careful in the hunt ye mates don't stave the boats needlessly ye harpooneers good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent within the year don't forget your prayers either mr starbuck mind that cooper don't waste the spare staves oh the sail-needles are in the green locker don't whale it too much a' lord's days men but don't miss a fair chance either that's rejecting heaven's good gifts have an eye to the molasses tierce mr stubb it was a little leaky i thought if ye touch at the islands mr flask beware of fornication good-bye good-bye don't keep that cheese too long down in the hold mr starbuck it'll spoil be careful with the butter -- twenty cents the pound it was and mind ye if -- come come captain bildad stop palavering -- away and with that peleg hurried him over the side and both dropt into the boat ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between a screaming gull flew overhead the two hulls wildly rolled we gave three heavy-hearted cheers and blindly plunged like fate into the lone atlantic chapter 23 the lee shore some chapters back one bulkington was spoken of a tall newlanded mariner encountered in new bedford at the inn when on that shivering winter's night the pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves who should i see standing at her helm but bulkington i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man who in mid-winter just landed from a four years' dangerous voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term the land seemed scorching to his feet wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable deep memories yield no epitaphs this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship that miserably drives along the leeward land the port would fain give succor the port is pitiful in the port is safety comfort hearthstone supper warm blankets friends all that's kind to our mortalities but in that gale the port the land is that ship's direst jeopardy she must fly all hospitality one touch of land though it but graze the keel would make her shudder through and through with all her might she crowds all sail off shore in so doing fights 'gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness again for refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril her only friend her bitterest foe know ye now bulkington glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore but as in landlessness alone resides highest truth shoreless indefinite as god -- so better is it to perish in that howling infinite than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee even if that were safety for worm-like then oh who would craven crawl to land terrors of the terrible is all this agony so vain take heart take heart o bulkington bear thee grimly demigod up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing -- straight up leaps thy apotheosis chapter 24 the advocate as queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore i am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales in the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact that among people at large the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions if a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits were he presented to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials s w f sperm whale fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us whalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business and that when actively engaged therein we are surrounded by all manner of defilements butchers we are that is true but butchers also and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honour and as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth but even granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies' plaudits and if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier's profession let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale's vast tail fanning into eddies the air over his head for what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of god but though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage yea an all-abounding adoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candles that burn round the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glory but look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts of scales see what we whalemen are and have been why did the dutch in de witt's time have admirals of their whaling fleets why did louis xvi of france at his own personal expense fit out whaling ships from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of nantucket why did britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of l1 000 000 and lastly how comes it that we whalemen of america now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels manned by eighteen thousand men yearly consuming 4 000 000 of dollars the ships worth at the time of sailing 20 000 000 and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of 7 000 000 how comes all this if there be not something puissant in whaling but this is not the half look again i freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for his life point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one way and another it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues that whaling may well be regarded as that egyptian mother who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb it would be a hopeless endless task to catalogue all these things let a handful suffice for many years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth she has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed if american and european men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the whale-ship which originally showed them the way and first interpreted between them and the savages they may celebrate as they will the heroes of exploring expeditions your cooks your krusensterns but i say that scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket that were as great and greater than your cook and your krusenstern for in their succourless empty-handedness they in the heathenish sharked waters and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands battled with virgin wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared all that is made such a flourish of in the old south sea voyages those things were but the life-time commonplaces of our heroic nantucketers often adventures which vancouver dedicates three chapters to these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship's common log ah the world oh the world until the whale fishery rounded cape horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between europe and the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast it was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the spanish crown touching those colonies and if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts that great america on the other side of the sphere australia was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman after its first blunder-born discovery by a dutchman all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous but the whale-ship touched there the whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony moreover in the infancy of the first australian settlement the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters the uncounted isles of all polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage to the whale-ship that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations if that double-bolted land japan is ever to become hospitable it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due for already she is on the threshold but if in the face of all this you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected with it then am i ready to shiver fifty lances with you there and unhorse you with a split helmet every time the whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you will say the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler who wrote the first account of our leviathan who but mighty job and who composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage who but no less a prince than alfred the great who with his own royal pen took down the words from other the norwegian whale-hunter of those times and who pronounced our glowing eulogy in parliament who but edmund burke true enough but then whalemen themselves are poor devils they have no good blood in their veins no good blood in their veins they have something better than royal blood there the grandmother of benjamin franklin was mary morrel afterwards by marriage mary folger one of the old settlers of nantucket and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and harpooneers -- all kith and kin to noble benjamin -- this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other good again but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable whaling not respectable whaling is imperial by old english statutory law the whale is declared a royal fish oh that's only nominal the whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing way the whale never figured in any grand imposing way in one of the mighty triumphs given to a roman general upon his entering the world's capital the bones of a whale brought all the way from the syrian coast were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession see subsequent chapters for something more on this head grant it since you cite it but say what you will there is no real dignity in whaling no dignity in whaling the dignity of our calling the very heavens attest cetus is a constellation in the south no more drive down your hat in presence of the czar and take it off to queequeg no more i know a man that in his lifetime has taken three hundred and fifty whales i account that man more honourable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns and as for me if by any possibility there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of if hereafter i shall do anything that upon the whole a man might rather have done than to have left undone if at my death my executors or more properly my creditors find any precious mss in my desk then here i prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling for a whale-ship was my yale college and my harvard chapter 25 postscript in behalf of the dignity of whaling i would fain advance naught but substantiated facts but after embattling his facts an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which might tell eloquently upon his cause -- such an advocate would he not be blameworthy it is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens even modern ones a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through there is a saltcellar of state so called and there may be a castor of state how they use the salt precisely -- who knows certain i am however that a king's head is solemnly oiled at his coronation even as a head of salad can it be though that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well as they anoint machinery much might be ruminated here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair and palpably smells of that anointing in truth a mature man who uses hair-oil unless medicinally that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere as a general rule he can't amount to much in his totality but the only thing to be considered here is this -- what kind of oil is used at coronations certainly it cannot be olive oil nor macassar oil nor castor oil nor bear's oil nor train oil nor cod-liver oil what then can it possibly be but sperm oil in its unmanufactured unpolluted state the sweetest of all oils think of that ye loyal britons we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff chapter 26 knights and squires the chief mate of the pequod was starbuck a native of nantucket and a quaker by descent he was a long earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit transported to the indies his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale he must have been born in some time of general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous only some thirty arid summers had he seen those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness but this his thinness so to speak seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight it was merely the condensation of the man he was by no means ill-looking quite the contrary his pure tight skin was an excellent fit and closely wrapped up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified egyptian this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come and to endure always as now for be it polar snow or torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates looking into his eyes you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life a staid steadfast man whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action and not a tame chapter of sounds yet for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude there were certain qualities in him which at times affected and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in some organizations seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward portents and inward presentiments were his and if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul much more did his far-away domestic memories of his young cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those latent influences which in some honest-hearted men restrain the gush of dare-devil daring so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery i will have no man in my boat said starbuck who is not afraid of a whale by this he seemed to mean not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward aye aye said stubb the second mate starbuck there is as careful a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery but we shall ere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by a man like stubb or almost any other whale hunter starbuck was no crusader after perils in him courage was not a sentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions besides he thought perhaps that in this business of whaling courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly wasted wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him for thought starbuck i am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew what doom was his own father's where in the bottomless deeps could he find the torn limbs of his brother with memories like these in him and moreover given to a certain superstitiousness as has been said the courage of this starbuck which could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme but it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him which under suitable circumstances would break out from its confinement and burn all his courage up and brave as he might be it was that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas or winds or whales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world yet cannot withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terrors which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor starbuck's fortitude scarce might i have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose the fall of valour in the soul men may seem detestable as joint stock-companies and nations knaves fools and murderers there may be men may have mean and meagre faces but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves so far within us that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man nor can piety itself at such a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars but this august dignity i treat of is not the dignity of kings and robes but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike that democratic dignity which on all hands radiates without end from god himself the great god absolute the centre and circumference of all democracy his omnipresence our divine equality if then to meanest mariners and renegades and castaways i shall hereafter ascribe high qualities though dark weave round them tragic graces if even the most mournful perchance the most abased among them all shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts if i shall touch that workman's arm with some ethereal light if i shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun then against all mortal critics bear me out in it thou just spirit of equality which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind bear me out in it thou great democratic god who didst not refuse to the swart convict bunyan the pale poetic pearl thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold the stumped and paupered arm of old cervantes thou who didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebbles who didst hurl him upon a war-horse who didst thunder him higher than a throne thou who in all thy mighty earthly marchings ever cullest thy selectest champions from the kingly commons bear me out in it o god chapter 27 knights and squires stubb was the second mate he was a native of cape cod and hence according to local usage was called a cape-cod-man a happy-go-lucky neither craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an indifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase toiling away calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year good-humored easy and careless he presided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his crew all invited guests he was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box when close to the whale in the very death-lock of the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly as a whistling tinker his hammer he would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster long usage had for this stubb converted the jaws of death into an easy chair what he thought of death itself there is no telling whether he ever thought of it at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order and not sooner what perhaps with other things made stubb such an easy-going unfearing man so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars all bowed to the ground with their packs what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his that thing must have been his pipe for like his nose his short black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face you would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe he kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in readiness anew for when stubb dressed instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers he put his pipe into his mouth i say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of his peculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly air whether ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it and as in time of the cholera some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths so likewise against all mortal tribulations stubb's tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent the third mate was flask a native of tisbury in martha's vineyard a short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him and therefore it was a sort of point of honour with him to destroy them whenever encountered so utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse or at least water-rat requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil this ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales he followed these fish for the fun of it and a three years' voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time as a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly divided little flask was one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long they called him king-post on board of the pequod because in form he could be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in arctic whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas now these three mates -- starbuck stubb and flask were momentous men they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the pequod's boats as headsmen in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales these three headsmen were as captains of companies or being armed with their long keen whaling spears they were as a picked trio of lancers even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins and since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothic knight of old is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance when the former one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault and moreover as there generally subsists between the two a close intimacy and friendliness it is therefore but meet that in this place we set down who the pequod's harpooneers were and to what headsman each of them belonged first of all was queequeg whom starbuck the chief mate had selected for his squire but queequeg is already known next was tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly promontory of martha's vineyard where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men which has long supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers in the fishery they usually go by the generic name of gay-headers tashtego's long lean sable hair his high cheek bones and black rounding eyes -- for an indian oriental in their largeness but antarctic in their glittering expression -- all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters who in quest of the great new england moose had scoured bow in hand the aboriginal forests of the main but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans and half-believed this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers of the air tashtego was stubb the second mate's squire third among the harpooneers was daggoo a gigantic coal-black negro-savage with a lion-like tread -- an ahasuerus to behold suspended from his ears were two golden hoops so large that the sailors called them ring-bolts and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to them in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his native coast and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues and erect as a giraffe moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks there was a corporeal humility in looking up at him and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress curious to tell this imperial negro ahasuerus daggoo was the squire of little flask who looked like a chess-man beside him as for the residue of the pequod's company be it said that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the american whale fishery are americans born though pretty nearly all the officers are herein it is the same with the american whale fishery as with the american army and military and merchant navies and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the american canals and railroads the same i say because in all these cases the native american liberally provides the brains the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles no small number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores where the outward bound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores in like manner the greenland whalers sailing out of hull or london put in at the shetland islands to receive the full complement of their crew upon the passage homewards they drop them there again how it is there is no telling but islanders seem to make the best whalemen they were nearly all islanders in the pequod isolatoes too i call such not acknowledging the common continent of men but each isolato living on a separate continent of his own yet now federated along one keel what a set these isolatoes were an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea and all the ends of the earth accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the world's grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back black little pip -- he never did -- oh no he went before poor alabama boy on the grim pequod's forecastle ye shall ere long see him beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time when sent for to the great quarter-deck on high he was bid strike in with angels and beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero there chapter 28 ahab for several days after leaving nantucket nothing above hatches was seen of captain ahab the mates regularly relieved each other at the watches and for aught that could be seen to the contrary they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously yes their supreme lord and dictator was there though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin every time i ascended to the deck from my watches below i instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a perturbation this was strangely heightened at times by the ragged elijah's diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived of but poorly could i withstand them much as in other moods i was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves but whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness -- to call it so -- which i felt yet whenever i came to look about me in the ship it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions for though the harpooneers with the great body of the crew were a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with still i ascribed this -- and rightly ascribed it -- to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked but it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship the mates which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage three better more likely sea-officers and men each in his own different way could not readily be found and they were every one of them americans a nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man now it being christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor for a space we had biting polar weather though all the time running away from it to the southward and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed gradually leaving that merciless winter and all its intolerable weather behind us it was one of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that as i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as i levelled my glance towards the taffrail foreboding shivers ran over me reality outran apprehension captain ahab stood upon his quarter-deck there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him nor of the recovery from any he looked like a man cut away from the stake when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness his whole high broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an unalterable mould like cellini's cast perseus threading its way out from among his grey hairs and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing you saw a slender rod-like mark lividly whitish it resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it and without wrenching a single twig peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded whether that mark was born with him or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound no one could certainly say by some tacit consent throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it especially by the mates but once tashtego's senior an old gay-head indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did ahab become that way branded and then it came upon him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at sea yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey manxman insinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of nantucket had never ere this laid eye upon wild ahab nevertheless the old sea-traditions the immemorial credulities popularly invested this old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment so that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever captain ahab should be tranquilly laid out -- which might hardly come to pass so he muttered -- then whoever should do that last office for the dead would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the first few moments i hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood it had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw aye he was dismasted off japan said the old gay-head indian once but like his dismasted craft he shipped another mast without coming home for it he has a quiver of 'em i was struck with the singular posture he maintained upon each side of the pequod's quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds there was an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into the plank his bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and holding by a shroud captain ahab stood erect looking straight out beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow there was an infinity of firmest fortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed and fearless forward dedication of that glance not a word he spoke nor did his officers say aught to him though by all their minutest gestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye and not only that but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe ere long from his first visit in the air he withdrew into his cabin but after that morning he was every day visible to the crew either standing in his pivot-hole or seated upon an ivory stool he had or heavily walking the deck as the sky grew less gloomy indeed began to grow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse as if when the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded and by and by it came to pass that he was almost continually in the air but as yet for all that he said or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast but the pequod was only making a passage now not regularly cruising nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to so that there was little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite ahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon nevertheless ere long the warm warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm him from his mood for as when the red-cheeked dancing girls april and may trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest ruggedest most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to welcome such glad-hearted visitants so ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look which in any other man would have soon flowered out in a smile chapter 29 enter ahab to him stubb some days elapsed and ice and icebergs all astern the pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring which at sea almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic the warmly cool clear ringing perfumed overflowing redundant days were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet heaped up -- flaked up with rose-water snow the starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of their absent conquering earls the golden helmeted suns for sleeping man 'twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights but all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world inward they turned upon the soul especially when the still mild hours of eve came on then memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights and all these subtle agencies more and more they wrought on ahab's texture old age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death among sea-commanders the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked deck it was so with ahab only that now of late he seemed so much to live in the open air that truly speaking his visits were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks it feels like going down into one's tomb -- he would mutter to himself -- for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to my grave-dug berth so almost every twenty-four hours when the watches of the night were set and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailors flung it not rudely down as by day but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle and ere long the old man would emerge gripping at the iron banister to help his crippled way some considering touch of humanity was in him for at times like these he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck because to his wearied mates seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks but once the mood was on him too deep for common regardings and as with heavy lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast stubb the old second mate came up from below with a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that if captain ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay but there might be some way of muffling the noise hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertion into it of the ivory heel ah stubb thou didst not know ahab then am i a cannon-ball stubb said ahab that thou wouldst wad me that fashion but go thy ways i had forgot below to thy nightly grave where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the filling one at last -- down dog and kennel starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man stubb was speechless a moment then said excitedly i am not used to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than half like it sir avast gritted ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away as if to avoid some passionate temptation no sir not yet said stubb emboldened i will not tamely be called a dog sir then be called ten times a donkey and a mule and an ass and begone or i'll clear the world of thee as he said this ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect that stubb involuntarily retreated i was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it muttered stubb as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle it's very queer stop stubb somehow now i don't well know whether to go back and strike him or -- what's that -- down here on my knees and pray for him yes that was the thought coming up in me but it would be the first time i ever did pray it's queer very queer and he's queer too aye take him fore and aft he's about the queerest old man stubb ever sailed with how he flashed at me -- his eyes like powder-pans is he mad anyway there's something on his mind as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks he aint in his bed now either more than three hours out of the twenty-four and he don't sleep then didn't that dough-boy the steward tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man's hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheets down at the foot and the coverlid almost tied into knots and the pillow a sort of frightful hot as though a baked brick had been on it a hot old man i guess he's got what some folks ashore call a conscience it's a kind of tic-dolly-row they say -- worse nor a toothache well well i don't know what it is but the lord keep me from catching it he's full of riddles i wonder what he goes into the after hold for every night as dough-boy tells me he suspects what's that for i should like to know who's made appointments with him in the hold ain't that queer now but there's no telling it's the old game -- here goes for a snooze damn me it's worth a fellow's while to be born into the world if only to fall right asleep and now that i think of it that's about the first thing babies do and that's a sort of queer too damn me but all things are queer come to think of 'em but that's against my principles think not is my eleventh commandment and sleep when you can is my twelfth -- so here goes again but how's that didn't he call me a dog blazes he called me ten times a donkey and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that he might as well have kicked me and done with it maybe he did kick me and i didn't observe it i was so taken all aback with his brow somehow it flashed like a bleached bone what the devil's the matter with me i don't stand right on my legs coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out by the lord i must have been dreaming though -- how how how -- but the only way's to stash it so here goes to hammock again and in the morning i'll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight chapter 30 the pipe when stubb had departed ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks and then as had been usual with him of late calling a sailor of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck he sat and smoked in old norse times the thrones of the sea-loving danish kings were fabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the narwhale how could one look at ahab then seated on that tripod of bones without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized for a khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of leviathans was ahab some moments passed during which the thick vapour came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs which blew back again into his face how now he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube this smoking no longer soothes oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone here have i been unconsciously toiling not pleasuring -- aye and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward and with such nervous whiffs as if like the dying whale my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble what business have i with this pipe this thing that is meant for sereneness to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs not among torn iron-grey locks like mine i'll smoke no more -- he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea the fire hissed in the waves the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made with slouched hat ahab lurchingly paced the planks chapter 31 queen mab next morning stubb accosted flask such a queer dream king-post i never had you know the old man's ivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me with it and when i tried to kick back upon my soul my little man i kicked my leg right off and then presto ahab seemed a pyramid and i like a blazing fool kept kicking at it but what was still more curious flask -- you know how curious all dreams are -- through all this rage that i was in i somehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult that kick from ahab 'why ' thinks i 'what's the row it's not a real leg only a false leg ' and there's a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump that's what makes a blow from the hand flask fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane the living member -- that makes the living insult my little man and thinks i to myself all the while mind while i was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid -- so confoundedly contradictory was it all all the while i say i was thinking to myself 'what's his leg now but a cane -- a whalebone cane yes ' thinks i 'it was only a playful cudgelling -- in fact only a whaleboning that he gave me -- not a base kick besides ' thinks i 'look at it once why the end of it -- the foot part -- what a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer kicked me there's a devilish broad insult but this insult is whittled down to a point only ' but now comes the greatest joke of the dream flask while i was battering away at the pyramid a sort of badger-haired old merman with a hump on his back takes me by the shoulders and slews me round 'what are you 'bout ' says he slid man but i was frightened such a phiz but somehow next moment i was over the fright 'what am i about ' says i at last 'and what business is that of yours i should like to know mr humpback do you want a kick ' by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turned round his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout -- what do you think i saw -- why thunder alive man his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes with the points out says i on second thoughts 'i guess i won't kick you old fellow ' 'wise stubb ' said he 'wise stubb ' and kept muttering it all the time a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag seeing he wasn't going to stop saying over his 'wise stubb wise stubb ' i thought i might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again but i had only just lifted my foot for it when he roared out 'stop that kicking ' 'halloa ' says i 'what's the matter now old fellow ' 'look ye here ' says he 'let's argue the insult captain ahab kicked ye didn't he ' 'yes he did ' says i -- 'right here it was ' 'very good ' says he -- 'he used his ivory leg didn't he ' 'yes he did ' says i 'well then ' says he 'wise stubb what have you to complain of didn't he kick with right good will it wasn't a common pitch pine leg he kicked with was it no you were kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb it's an honour i consider it an honour listen wise stubb in old england the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made garter-knights of but be your boast stubb that ye were kicked by old ahab and made a wise man of remember what i say be kicked by him account his kicks honours and on no account kick back for you can't help yourself wise stubb don't you see that pyramid ' with that he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into the air i snored rolled over and there i was in my hammock now what do you think of that dream flask i don't know it seems a sort of foolish to me tho ' may be may be but it's made a wise man of me flask d'ye see ahab standing there sideways looking over the stern well the best thing you can do flask is to let the old man alone never speak to him whatever he says halloa what's that he shouts hark mast-head there look sharp all of ye there are whales hereabouts if ye see a white one split your lungs for him what do you think of that now flask ain't there a small drop of something queer about that eh a white whale -- did ye mark that man look ye -- there's something special in the wind stand by for it flask ahab has that that's bloody on his mind but mum he comes this way chapter 32 cetology already we are boldly launched upon the deep but soon we shall be lost in its unshored harbourless immensities ere that come to pass ere the pequod's weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera that i would now fain put before you yet is it no easy task the classification of the constituents of a chaos nothing less is here essayed listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down no branch of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled cetology says captain scoresby a d 1820 it is not my intention were it in my power to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal sperm whale says surgeon beale a d 1839 unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea a field strewn with thorns all these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists thus speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson those lights of zoology and anatomy nevertheless though of real knowledge there be little yet of books there are a plenty and so in some small degree with cetology or the science of whales many are the men small and great old and new landsmen and seamen who have at large or in little written of the whale run over a few -- the authors of the bible aristotle pliny aldrovandi sir thomas browne gesner ray linnaeus rondeletius willoughby green artedi sibbald brisson marten lacepede bonneterre desmarest baron cuvier frederick cuvier john hunter owen scoresby beale bennett j ross browne the author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev t cheever but to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written the above cited extracts will show of the names in this list of whale authors only those following owen ever saw living whales and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman i mean captain scoresby on the separate subject of the greenland or right-whale he is the best existing authority but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas he is not even by any means the largest of the whales yet owing to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports this usurpation has been every way complete reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days will satisfy you that the greenland whale without one rival was to them the monarch of the seas but the time has at last come for a new proclamation this is charing cross hear ye good people all -- the greenland whale is deposed -- the great sperm whale now reigneth there are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt those books are beale's and bennett's both in their time surgeons to english south-sea whale-ships and both exact and reliable men the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small but so far as it goes it is of excellent quality though mostly confined to scientific description as yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic lives not complete in any literature far above all other hunted whales his is an unwritten life now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the present hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers as no better man advances to take this matter in hand i hereupon offer my own poor endeavors i promise nothing complete because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species or -- in this place at least -- to much of any description my object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology i am the architect not the builder but it is a ponderous task no ordinary letter-sorter in the post-office is equal to it to grope down into the bottom of the sea after them to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations ribs and very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing what am i that i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan the awful tauntings in job might well appal me will he the leviathan make a covenant with thee behold the hope of him is vain but i have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans i have had to do with whales with these visible hands i am in earnest and i will try there are some preliminaries to settle first the uncertain unsettled condition of this science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish in his system of nature a d 1776 linnaeus declares i hereby separate the whales from the fish but of my own knowledge i know that down to the year 1850 sharks and shad alewives and herring against linnaeus's express edict were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the leviathan the grounds upon which linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters he states as follows on account of their warm bilocular heart their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege naturae jure meritoque i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley coffin of nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient charley profanely hinted they were humbug be it known that waiving all argument i take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy jonah to back me this fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish above linnaeus has given you those items but in brief they are these lungs and warm blood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded next how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come to be short then a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail there you have him however contracted that definition is the result of expanded meditation a walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is not a fish because he is amphibious but the last term of the definition is still more cogent as coupled with the first almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat but a vertical or up-and-down tail whereas among spouting fish the tail though it may be similarly shaped invariably assumes a horizontal position by the above definition of what a whale is i do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed nantucketers nor on the other hand link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of cetology now then come the grand divisions of the entire whale host i am aware that down to the present time the fish styled lamatins and dugongs pig-fish and sow-fish of the coffins of nantucket are included by many naturalists among the whales but as these pig-fish are a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on wet hay and especially as they do not spout i deny their credentials as whales and have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of cetology first according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primary books subdivisible into chapters and these shall comprehend them all both small and large i the folio whale ii the octavo whale iii the duodecimo whale as the type of the folio i present the sperm whale of the octavo the grampus of the duodecimo the porpoise folios among these i here include the following chapters -- i the sperm whale ii the right whale iii the fin-back whale iv the hump-backed whale v the razor-back whale vi the sulphur-bottom whale book i folio chapter i sperm whale -- this whale among the english of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale and the physeter whale and the anvil headed whale is the present cachalot of the french and the pottsfich of the germans and the macrocephalus of the long words he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe the most formidable of all whales to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being the only creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti is obtained all his peculiarities will in many other places be enlarged upon it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do philologically considered it is absurd some centuries ago when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish in those days spermaceti it would seem was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland or right whale it was the idea also that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses in those times also spermaceti was exceedingly scarce not being used for light but only as an ointment and medicament it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb when as i opine in the course of time the true nature of spermaceti became known its original name was still retained by the dealers no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity and so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived book i folio chapter ii right whale -- in one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans being the one first regularly hunted by man it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen and the oil specially known as whale oil an inferior article in commerce among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles the whale the greenland whale the black whale the great whale the true whale the right whale there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised what then is the whale which i include in the second species of my folios it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalists the greenland whale of the english whalemen the baliene ordinaire of the french whalemen the growlands walfish of the swedes it is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas it is the whale which the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean on the brazil banks on the nor' west coast and various other parts of the world designated by them right whale cruising grounds some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the english and the right whale of the americans but they precisely agree in all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction it is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length with reference to elucidating the sperm whale book i folio chapter iii fin-back -- under this head i reckon a monster which by the various names of fin-back tall-spout and long-john has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the atlantic in the new york packet-tracks in the length he attains and in his baleen the fin-back resembles the right whale but is of a less portly girth and a lighter colour approaching to olive his great lips present a cable-like aspect formed by the intertwisting slanting folds of large wrinkles his grand distinguishing feature the fin from which he derives his name is often a conspicuous object this fin is some three or four feet long growing vertically from the hinder part of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will at times be seen plainly projecting from the surface when the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked with spherical ripples and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it on that ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back the fin-back is not gregarious he seems a whale-hater as some men are man-haters very shy always going solitary unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming as to defy all present pursuit from man this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race bearing for his mark that style upon his back from having the baleen in his mouth the fin-back is sometimes included with the right whale among a theoretic species denominated whalebone whales that is whales with baleen of these so called whalebone whales there would seem to be several varieties most of which however are little known broad-nosed whales and beaked whales pike-headed whales bunched whales under-jawed whales and rostrated whales are the fishermen's names for a few sorts in connection with this appellative of whalebone whales it is of great importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan founded upon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions which the whale in his kinds presents how then the baleen hump back-fin and teeth these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars thus the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases then this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these has baleen but there again the similitude ceases and it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned in various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations or in the case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis on this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split but it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts of the whale in his anatomy -- there at least we shall be able to hit the right classification nay what thing for example is there in the greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the greenland whale and if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated what then remains nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way and this is the bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only one that can possibly succeed for it alone is practicable to proceed book i folio chapter iv hump-back -- this whale is often seen on the northern american coast he has been frequently captured there and towed into harbor he has a great pack on him like a peddler or you might call him the elephant and castle whale at any rate the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one his oil is not very valuable he has baleen he is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them book i folio chapter v razor-back -- of this whale little is known but his name i have seen him at a distance off cape horn of a retiring nature he eludes both hunters and philosophers though no coward he has never yet shown any part of him but his back which rises in a long sharp ridge let him go i know little more of him nor does anybody else book i folio chapter vi sulphur-bottom -- another retiring gentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping along the tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings he is seldom seen at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance he is never chased he would run away with rope-walks of line prodigies are told of him adieu sulphur bottom i can say nothing more that is true of ye nor can the oldest nantucketer thus ends book i folio and now begins book ii octavo octavoes -- these embrace the whales of middling magnitude among which present may be numbered -- i the grampus ii the black fish iii the narwhale iv the thrasher v the killer why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain because while the whales of this order though smaller than those of the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure yet the bookbinder's quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume does book ii octavo chapter i grampus -- though this fish whose loud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has furnished a proverb to landsmen is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not popularly classed among whales but possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan most naturalists have recognised him for one he is of moderate octavo size varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length and of corresponding dimensions round the waist he swims in herds he is never regularly hunted though his oil is considerable in quantity and pretty good for light by some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale book ii octavo chapter ii black fish -- i give the popular fishermen's names for all these fish for generally they are the best where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive i shall say so and suggest another i do so now touching the black fish so-called because blackness is the rule among almost all whales so call him the hyena whale if you please his voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards he carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face this whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length he is found in almost all latitudes he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming which looks something like a roman nose when not more profitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment -- as some frugal housekeepers in the absence of company and quite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax though their blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil book ii octavo chapter iii narwhale that is nostril whale -- another instance of a curiously named whale so named i suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose the creature is some sixteen feet in length while its horn averages five feet though some exceed ten and even attain to fifteen feet strictly speaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal but it is only found on the sinister side which has an ill effect giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers it would be hard to say it does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish though some sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food charley coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer for the narwhale rising to the surface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice thrusts his horn up and so breaks through but you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct my own opinion is that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the narwhale -- however that may be -- it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale the horned whale and the unicorn whale he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature from certain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this same sea-unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison and as such preparations of it brought immense prices it was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that voyage when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of greenwich palace as his bold ship sailed down the thames when sir martin returned from that voyage saith black letter on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the narwhale which for a long period after hung in the castle at windsor an irish author avers that the earl of leicester on bended knees did likewise present to her highness another horn pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature the narwhale has a very picturesque leopard-like look being of a milk-white ground colour dotted with round and oblong spots of black his oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas book ii octavo chapter iv killer -- of this whale little is precisely known to the nantucketer and nothing at all to the professed naturalist from what i have seen of him at a distance i should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus he is very savage -- a sort of feegee fish he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip and hangs there like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to death the killer is never hunted i never heard what sort of oil he has exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground of its indistinctness for we are all killers on land and on sea bonapartes and sharks included book ii octavo chapter v thrasher -- this gentleman is famous for his tail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes he mounts the folio whale's back and as he swims he works his passage by flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer both are outlaws even in the lawless seas thus ends book ii octavo and begins book iii duodecimo duodecimoes -- these include the smaller whales i the huzza porpoise ii the algerine porpoise iii the mealy-mouthed porpoise to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may possibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among whales -- a word which in the popular sense always conveys an idea of hugeness but the creatures set down above as duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms of my definition of what a whale is -- i e a spouting fish with a horizontal tail book iii duodecimo chapter 1 huzza porpoise -- this is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe the name is of my own bestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoises and something must be done to distinguish them i call him thus because he always swims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a fourth-of-july crowd their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner full of fine spirits they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward they are the lads that always live before the wind they are accounted a lucky omen if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye a well-fed plump huzza porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil but the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable it is in request among jewellers and watchmakers sailors put it on their hones porpoise meat is good eating you know it may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts indeed his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible but the next time you have a chance watch him and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature book iii duodecimo chapter ii algerine porpoise -- a pirate very savage he is only found i think in the pacific he is somewhat larger than the huzza porpoise but much of the same general make provoke him and he will buckle to a shark i have lowered for him many times but never yet saw him captured book iii duodecimo chapter iii mealy-mouthed porpoise -- the largest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific so far as it is known the only english name by which he has hitherto been designated is that of the fishers -- right-whale porpoise from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio in shape he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure he has no fins on his back most other porpoises have he has a lovely tail and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel hue but his mealy-mouth spoils all though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in a ship's hull called the bright waist that line streaks him from stem to stern with two separate colours black above and white below the white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag a most mean and mealy aspect his oil is much like that of the common porpoise beyond the duodecimo this system does not proceed inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales above you have all the leviathans of note but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive half-fabulous whales which as an american whaleman i know by reputation but not personally i shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators who may complete what i have here but begun if any of the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked then he can readily be incorporated into this system according to his folio octavo or duodecimo magnitude -- the bottle-nose whale the junk whale the pudding-headed whale the cape whale the leading whale the cannon whale the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whale the iceberg whale the quog whale the blue whale etc from icelandic dutch and old english authorities there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names but i omit them as altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds full of leviathanism but signifying nothing finally it was stated at the outset that this system would not be here and at once perfected you cannot but plainly see that i have kept my word but i now leave my cetological system standing thus unfinished even as the great cathedral of cologne was left with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower for small erections may be finished by their first architects grand ones true ones ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep me from ever completing anything this whole book is but a draught -- nay but the draught of a draught oh time strength cash and patience chapter 33 the specksynder concerning the officers of the whale-craft this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet the large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two centuries and more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain but was divided between him and an officer called the specksynder literally this word means fat-cutter usage however in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer in those days the captain's authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns the specksynder or chief harpooneer reigned supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted title of specksioneer this old dutch official is still retained but his former dignity is sadly abridged at present he ranks simply as senior harpooneer and as such is but one of the captain's more inferior subalterns nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat but under certain circumstances night watches on a whaling ground the command of the ship's deck is also his therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior though always by them familiarly regarded as their social equal now the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea is this -- the first lives aft the last forward hence in whale-ships and merchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with the captain and so too in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship that is to say they take their meals in the captain's cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it though the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar perils of it and the community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom high or low depend for their profits not upon fixed wages but upon their common luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and hard work though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally yet never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may in some primitive instances live together for all that the punctilious externals at least of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed and in no instance done away indeed many are the nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage he ever exacted was implicit instantaneous obedience though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck and though there were times when owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed he addressed them in unusual terms whether of condescension or in terrorem or otherwise yet even captain ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea nor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behind those forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himself incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve that certain sultanism of his brain which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship for be a man's intellectual superiority what it will it can never assume the practical available supremacy over other men without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments always in themselves more or less paltry and base this it is that for ever keeps god's true princes of the empire from the world's hustings and leaves the highest honours that this air can give to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency but when as in the case of nicholas the czar the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization nor will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in his art as the one now alluded to but ahab my captain still moves before me in all his nantucket grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching emperors and kings i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me oh ahab what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for in the deep and featured in the unbodied air chapter 34 the cabin-table it is noon and dough-boy the steward thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle announces dinner to his lord and master who sitting in the lee quarter-boat has just been taking an observation of the sun and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth medallion-shaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to the tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial but presently catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to the deck and in an even unexhilarated voice saying dinner mr starbuck disappears into the cabin when the last echo of his sultan's step has died away and starbuck the first emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated then starbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along the planks and after a grave peep into the binnacle says with some touch of pleasantness dinner mr stubb and descends the scuttle the second emir lounges about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking the main brace to see whether it will be all right with that important rope he likewise takes up the old burden and with a rapid dinner mr flask follows after his predecessors but the third emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking off his shoes he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand turk's head and then by a dexterous sleight pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck reversing all other processions by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and then independent hilarious little flask enters king ahab's presence in the character of abjectus or the slave it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea-usages that while in the open air of the deck some officers will upon provocation bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander's cabin and straightway their inoffensive not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him as he sits at the head of the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this difference a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king of babylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests that man's unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time that man's royalty of state transcends belshazzar's for belshazzar was not the greatest who has but once dined his friends has tasted what it is to be caesar it is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding now if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master then by inference you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned over his ivory-inlaid table ahab presided like a mute maned sea-lion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs in his own proper turn each officer waited to be served they were as little children before ahab and yet in ahab there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mind their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife as he carved the chief dish before him i do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation even upon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reaching out his knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked ahab thereby motioned starbuck's plate towards him the mate received his meat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little started if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection for like the coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation only he himself was dumb what a relief it was to choking stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below and poor little flask he was the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party his were the shinbones of the saline beef his would have been the drumsticks for flask to have presumed to help himself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say ahab never forbade him and had flask helped himself the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it least of all did flask presume to help himself to butter whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account of its clotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long a voyage in such marketless waters butter was at a premium and therefore was not for him a subaltern however it was flask alas was a butterless man another thing flask was the last person down at the dinner and flask is the first man up consider for hereby flask's dinner was badly jammed in point of time starbuck and stubb both had the start of him and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear if stubb even who is but a peg higher than flask happens to have but a small appetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then flask must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck therefore it was that flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry more or less for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departed from my stomach i am an officer but how i wish i could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the forecastle as i used to when i was before the mast there's the fruits of promotion now there's the vanity of glory there's the insanity of life besides if it were so that any mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flask's official capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance was to go aft at dinner-time and get a peep at flask through the cabin sky-light sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab now ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the pequod's cabin after their departure taking place in inverted order to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward and then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast they being its residuary legatees they made a sort of temporary servants' hall of the high and mighty cabin in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain's table was the entire care-free license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers while their masters the mates seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it they dined like lords they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast often the pale dough-boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk seemingly quarried out of the solid ox and if he were not lively about it if he did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back harpoon-wise and once daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted dough-boy's memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him he was naturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little fellow this bread-faced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages dough-boy's whole life was one continual lip-quiver commonly after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door till all was over it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego opposing his filed teeth to the indian's crosswise to them daggoo seated on the floor for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines at every motion of his colossal limbs making the low cabin framework to shake as when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship but for all this the great negro was wonderfully abstemious not to say dainty it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad baronial and superb a person but doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds not by beef or by bread are giants made or nourished but queequeg he had a mortal barbaric smack of the lip in eating -- an ugly sound enough -- so much so that the trembling dough-boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce himself that his bones might be picked the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for their lances and other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor dough-boy how could he forget that in his island days queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of some murderous convivial indiscretions alas dough-boy hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals not a napkin should he carry on his arm but a buckler in good time though to his great delight the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart to his credulous fable-mongering ears all their martial bones jingling in them at every step like moorish scimetars in scabbards but though these barbarians dined in the cabin and nominally lived there still being anything but sedentary in their habits they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes and just before sleeping-time when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters in this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most american whale captains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship's cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is at any time permitted there so that in real truth the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it for when they did enter it it was something as a street-door enters a house turning inwards for a moment only to be turned out the next and as a permanent thing residing in the open air nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin was no companionship socially ahab was inaccessible though nominally included in the census of christendom he was still an alien to it he lived in the world as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled missouri and as when spring and summer had departed that wild logan of the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling old age ahab's soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom chapter 35 the mast-head it was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast-head came round in most american whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port even though she may have fifteen thousand miles and more to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground and if after a three four or five years' voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her -- say an empty vial even -- then her mast-heads are kept manned to the last and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more now as the business of standing mast-heads ashore or afloat is a very ancient and interesting one let us in some measure expatiate here i take it that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old egyptians because in all my researches i find none prior to them for though their progenitors the builders of babel must doubtless by their tower have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all asia or africa either yet ere the final truck was put to it as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the dread gale of god's wrath therefore we cannot give these babel builders priority over the egyptians and that the egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers is an assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices whereby with prodigious long upliftings of their legs those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new stars even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearing in sight in saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old times who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiantly facing everything out to the last literally died at his post of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiff gale are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight there is napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome stands with arms folded some one hundred and fifty feet in the air careless now who rules the decks below whether louis philippe louis blanc or louis the devil great washington too stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in baltimore and like one of hercules' pillars his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go admiral nelson also on a capstan of gun-metal stands his mast-head in trafalgar square and ever when most obscured by that london smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero is there for where there is smoke must be fire but neither great washington nor napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze however it may be surmised that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not so is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy the sole historian of nantucket stands accountable the worthy obed tells us that in the early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea-coast to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house a few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand who upon descrying the game gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach but this custom has now become obsolete turn we then to the one proper mast-head that of a whale-ship at sea the three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set the seamen taking their regular turns as at the helm and relieving each other every two hours in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head nay to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful there you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks striding along the deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while beneath you and between your legs as it were swim the hugest monsters of the sea even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old rhodes there you stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with nothing ruffled but the waves the tranced ship indolently rolls the drowsy trade winds blow everything resolves you into languor for the most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulness invests you you hear no news read no gazettes extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements you hear of no domestic afflictions bankrupt securities fall of stocks are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner -- for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks and your bill of fare is immutable in one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four years' voyage as often happens the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head would amount to several entire months and it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling such as pertains to a bed a hammock a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves your most usual point of perch is the head of the t' gallant-mast where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks almost peculiar to whalemen called the t' gallant cross-trees here tossed about by the sea the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns to be sure in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape of a watch-coat but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle and cannot freely move about in it nor even move out of it without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in winter so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope or additional skin encasing you you cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch-coat concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits called crow's-nests in which the look-outs of a greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas in the fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled a voyage among the icebergs in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the re-discovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland in this admirable volume all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented crow's-nest of the glacier which was the name of captain sleet's good craft he called it the sleet's crow's-nest in honour of himself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from all ridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own children after our own names we fathers being the original inventors and patentees so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget in shape the sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom on the after side or side next the stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrellas comforters and coats in front is a leather rack in which to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope and other nautical conveniences when captain sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow's-nest of his he tells us that he always had a rifle with him also fixed in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing now it was plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe as he does all the little detailed conveniences of his crow's-nest but though he so enlarges upon many of these and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow's-nest with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the local attraction of all binnacle magnets an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship's planks and in the glacier's case perhaps to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew i say that though the captain is very discreet and scientific here yet for all his learned binnacle deviations azimuth compass observations and approximate errors he knows very well captain sleet that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow's nest within easy reach of his hand though upon the whole i greatly admire and even love the brave the honest and learned captain yet i take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest within three or four perches of the pole but if we southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as captain sleet and his greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage is greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float for one i used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a chat with queequeg or any one else off duty whom i might find there then ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pastures and so at last mount to my ultimate destination let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that i kept but sorry guard with the problem of the universe revolving in me how could i -- being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude -- how could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships' standing orders keep your weather eye open and sing out every time and let me in this place movingly admonish you ye ship-owners of nantucket beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativeness and who offers to ship with the phaedon instead of bowditch in his head beware of such an one i say your whales must be seen before they can be killed and this sunken-eyed young platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer nor are these monitions at all unneeded for nowadays the whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absent-minded young men disgusted with the carking cares of earth and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship and in moody phrase ejaculates -- roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young philosophers to task upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient interest in the voyage half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise but all in vain those young platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect they are short-sighted what use then to strain the visual nerve they have left their opera-glasses at home why thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lads we've been cruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised a whale yet whales are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou art up here perhaps they were or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts that at last he loses his identity takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep blue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every strange half-seen gliding beautiful thing that eludes him every dimly-discovered uprising fin of some undiscernible form seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it in this enchanted mood thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came becomes diffused through time and space like crammer's sprinkled pantheistic ashes forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over there is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea from the inscrutable tides of god but while this sleep this dream is on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your identity comes back in horror over descartian vortices you hover and perhaps at mid-day in the fairest weather with one half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea no more to rise for ever heed it well ye pantheists chapter 36 the quarter-deck enter ahab then all it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast ahab as was his wont ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck there most sea-captains usually walk at that hour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns in the garden soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his old rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all over dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk did you fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also you would see still stranger foot-prints -- the foot-prints of his one unsleeping ever-pacing thought but on the occasion in question those dents looked deeper even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark and so full of his thought was ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement d'ye mark him flask whispered stubb the chick that's in him pecks the shell 'twill soon be out the hours wore on -- ahab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect it drew near the close of day suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there and with one hand grasping a shroud he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft sir said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship-board except in some extraordinary case send everybody aft repeated ahab mast-heads there come down when the entire ship's company were assembled and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up ahab after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks and then darting his eyes among the crew started from his standpoint and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck with bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till stubb cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat but this did not last long vehemently pausing he cried -- what do ye do when ye see a whale men sing out for him was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices good cried ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them and what do ye next men lower away and after him and what tune is it ye pull to men a dead whale or a stove boat more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew the countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions but they were all eagerness again as ahab now half-revolving in his pivot-hole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus -- all ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale look ye d'ye see this spanish ounce of gold -- holding up a broad bright coin to the sun -- it is a sixteen dollar piece men d'ye see it mr starbuck hand me yon top-maul while the mate was getting the hammer ahab without speaking was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as if to heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him receiving the top-maul from starbuck he advanced towards the main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with the other and with a high raised voice exclaiming whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke -- look ye whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boys huzza huzza cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast it's a white whale i say resumed ahab as he threw down the topmaul a white whale skin your eyes for him men look sharp for white water if ye see but a bubble sing out all this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection captain ahab said tashtego that white whale must be the same that some call moby dick moby dick shouted ahab do ye know the white whale then tash does he fan-tail a little curious sir before he goes down said the gay-header deliberately and has he a curious spout too said daggoo very bushy even for a parmacetty and mighty quick captain ahab and he have one two three -- oh good many iron in him hide too captain cried queequeg disjointedly all twiske-tee be-twisk like him -- him -- faltering hard for a word and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle -- like him -- him -- corkscrew cried ahab aye queequeg the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout is a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white as a pile of our nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing aye tashtego and he fan-tails like a split jib in a squall death and devils men it is moby dick ye have seen -- moby dick -- moby dick captain ahab said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder captain ahab i have heard of moby dick -- but it was not moby dick that took off thy leg who told thee that cried ahab then pausing aye starbuck aye my hearties all round it was moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that brought me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye he shouted with a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heart-stricken moose aye aye it was that accursed white whale that razeed me made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day then tossing both arms with measureless imprecations he shouted out aye aye and i'll chase him round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and round perdition's flames before i give him up and this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out what say ye men will ye splice hands on it now i think ye do look brave aye aye shouted the harpooneers and seamen running closer to the excited old man a sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for moby dick god bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout god bless ye men steward go draw the great measure of grog but what's this long face about mr starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not game for moby dick i am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of death too captain ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow but i came here to hunt whales not my commander's vengeance how many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it captain ahab it will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market nantucket market hoot but come closer starbuck thou requirest a little lower layer if money's to be the measurer man and the accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe by girdling it with guineas one to every three parts of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here he smites his chest whispered stubb what's that for methinks it rings most vast but hollow vengeance on a dumb brute cried starbuck that simply smote thee from blindest instinct madness to be enraged with a dumb thing captain ahab seems blasphemous hark ye yet again -- the little lower layer all visible objects man are but as pasteboard masks but in each event -- in the living act the undoubted deed -- there some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask if man will strike strike through the mask how can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall to me the white whale is that wall shoved near to me sometimes i think there's naught beyond but 'tis enough he tasks me he heaps me i see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malice sinewing it that inscrutable thing is chiefly what i hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale principal i will wreak that hate upon him talk not to me of blasphemy man i'd strike the sun if it insulted me for could the sun do that then could i do the other since there is ever a sort of fair play herein jealousy presiding over all creations but not my master man is even that fair play who's over me truth hath no confines take off thine eye more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish stare so so thou reddenest and palest my heat has melted thee to anger-glow but look ye starbuck what is said in heat that thing unsays itself there are men from whom warm words are small indignity i meant not to incense thee let it go look see yonder turkish cheeks of spotted tawn -- living breathing pictures painted by the sun the pagan leopards -- the unrecking and unworshipping things that live and seek and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel the crew man the crew are they not one and all with ahab in this matter of the whale see stubb he laughs see yonder chilian he snorts to think of it stand up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling cannot starbuck and what is it reckon it 'tis but to help strike a fin no wondrous feat for starbuck what is it more from this one poor hunt then the best lance out of all nantucket surely he will not hang back when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone ah constrainings seize thee i see the billow lifts thee speak but speak -- aye aye thy silence then that voices thee aside something shot from my dilated nostrils he has inhaled it in his lungs starbuck now is mine cannot oppose me now without rebellion god keep me -- keep us all murmured starbuck lowly but in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from the hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts as for a moment their hearts sank in for again starbuck's downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life the subterranean laugh died away the winds blew on the sails filled out the ship heaved and rolled as before ah ye admonitions and warnings why stay ye not when ye come but rather are ye predictions than warnings ye shadows yet not so much predictions from without as verifications of the foregoing things within for with little external to constrain us the innermost necessities in our being these still drive us on the measure the measure cried ahab receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneers he ordered them to produce their weapons then ranging them before him near the capstan with their harpoons in their hands while his three mates stood at his side with their lances and the rest of the ship's company formed a circle round the group he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew but those wild eyes met his as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison but alas only to fall into the hidden snare of the indian drink and pass he cried handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman the crew alone now drink round with it round short draughts -- long swallows men 'tis hot as satan's hoof so so it goes round excellently it spiralizes in ye forks out at the serpent-snapping eye well done almost drained that way it went this way it comes hand it me -- here's a hollow men ye seem the years so brimming life is gulped and gone steward refill attend now my braves i have mustered ye all round this capstan and ye mates flank me with your lances and ye harpooneers stand there with your irons and ye stout mariners ring me in that i may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me o men you will yet see that -- ha boy come back bad pennies come not sooner hand it me why now this pewter had run brimming again were't not thou st vitus' imp -- away thou ague advance ye mates cross your lances full before me well done let me touch the axis so saying with extended arm he grasped the three level radiating lances at their crossed centre while so doing suddenly and nervously twitched them meanwhile glancing intently from starbuck to stubb from stubb to flask it seemed as though by some nameless interior volition he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own magnetic life the three mates quailed before his strong sustained and mystic aspect stubb and flask looked sideways from him the honest eye of starbuck fell downright in vain cried ahab but maybe 'tis well for did ye three but once take the full-forced shock then mine own electric thing that had perhaps expired from out me perchance too it would have dropped ye dead perchance ye need it not down lances and now ye mates i do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there -- yon three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen my valiant harpooneers disdain the task what when the great pope washes the feet of beggars using his tiara for ewer oh my sweet cardinals your own condescension that shall bend ye to it i do not order ye ye will it cut your seizings and draw the poles ye harpooneers silently obeying the order the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons some three feet long held barbs up before him stab me not with that keen steel cant them cant them over know ye not the goblet end turn up the socket so so now ye cup-bearers advance the irons take them hold them while i fill forthwith slowly going from one officer to the other he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter now three to three ye stand commend the murderous chalices bestow them ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league ha starbuck but the deed is done yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it drink ye harpooneers drink and swear ye men that man the deathful whaleboat's bow -- death to moby dick god hunt us all if we do not hunt moby dick to his death the long barbed steel goblets were lifted and to cries and maledictions against the white whale the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss starbuck paled and turned and shivered once more and finally the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew when waving his free hand to them they all dispersed and ahab retired within his cabin chapter 37 sunset the cabin by the stern windows ahab sitting alone and gazing out i leave a white and turbid wake pale waters paler cheeks where'er i sail the envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track let them but first i pass yonder by ever-brimming goblet's rim the warm waves blush like wine the gold brow plumbs the blue the diver sun -- slow dived from noon -- goes down my soul mounts up she wearies with her endless hill is then the crown too heavy that i wear this iron crown of lombardy yet is it bright with many a gem i the wearer see not its far flashings but darkly feel that i wear that that dazzlingly confounds 'tis iron -- that i know -- not gold 'tis split too -- that i feel the jagged edge galls me so my brain seems to beat against the solid metal aye steel skull mine the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight dry heat upon my brow oh time was when as the sunrise nobly spurred me so the sunset soothed no more this lovely light it lights not me all loveliness is anguish to me since i can ne'er enjoy gifted with the high perception i lack the low enjoying power damned most subtly and most malignantly damned in the midst of paradise good night -- good night waving his hand he moves from the window 'twas not so hard a task i thought to find one stubborn at the least but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels and they revolve or if you will like so many ant-hills of powder they all stand before me and i their match oh hard that to fire others the match itself must needs be wasting what i've dared i've willed and what i've willed i'll do they think me mad -- starbuck does but i'm demoniac i am madness maddened that wild madness that's only calm to comprehend itself the prophecy was that i should be dismembered and -- aye i lost this leg i now prophesy that i will dismember my dismemberer now then be the prophet and the fulfiller one that's more than ye ye great gods ever were i laugh and hoot at ye ye cricket-players ye pugilists ye deaf burkes and blinded bendigoes i will not say as schoolboys do to bullies -- take some one of your own size don't pommel me no ye've knocked me down and i am up again but ye have run and hidden come forth from behind your cotton bags i have no long gun to reach ye come ahab's compliments to ye come and see if ye can swerve me swerve me ye cannot swerve me else ye swerve yourselves man has ye there swerve me the path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails whereon my soul is grooved to run over unsounded gorges through the rifled hearts of mountains under torrents' beds unerringly i rush naught's an obstacle naught's an angle to the iron way chapter 38 dusk by the mainmast starbuck leaning against it my soul is more than matched she's overmanned and by a madman insufferable sting that sanity should ground arms on such a field but he

no knife to cut horrible old man who's over him he cries -- aye he would be a democrat to all above look how he lords it over all below oh i plainly see my miserable office -- to obey rebelling and worse yet to hate with touch of pity for in his eyes i read some lurid woe would shrivel me up had i it yet is there hope time and tide flow wide the hated whale has the round watery world to swim in

whale is their demigorgon hark the infernal orgies that revelry is forward mark the unfaltering silence aft methinks it pictures life foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay embattled bantering bow but only to drag dark ahab after it where he broods within his sternward cabin builded over the dead water of the wake and further on hunted by its wolfish gurglings the long howl thrills me through peace ye revellers and set the watch oh life 'tis in an hour like this with soul beat down and held to knowledge -- as wild untutored things are forced to feed -- oh life 'tis now

up with the rest my oath had been welded with theirs and stronger i shouted and more did i hammer and clinch my oath because of the dread in my soul a wild mystical sympathetical feeling was in me ahab's quenchless feud seemed mine with greedy ears i learned the history of that murderous monster against whom i and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge for some time past though at intervals only the unaccompanied secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the sperm whale fishermen but not all of them knew of his existence only a few of them comparatively had knowingly seen him while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him was small indeed for owing to the large number of whale-cruisers the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the times of sailing from home all these with other circumstances direct and indirect long obstructed the spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby dick it was hardly to be doubted that several vessels reported to have encountered at such or such a time or on such or such a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after doing great mischief to his assailants had completely escaped them to some minds it was not an unfair presumption i say that the whale in question must have been no other than moby dick yet as of late the sperm whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity cunning and malice in the monster attacked therefore it was that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick such hunters perhaps for the most part were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred more as it were to the perils of the sperm whale fishery at large than to the individual cause in that way mostly the disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded and as for those who previously hearing of the white whale by chance caught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them almost as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him as for any other whale of that species but at length such calamities did ensue in these assaults -- not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles broken limbs or devouring amputations -- but fatal to the last degree of fatality those repeated disastrous repulses all accumulating and piling their terrors upon moby dick those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters for not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events -- as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi but in maritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumors abound wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to and as the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there for not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors but of all sailors they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels but hand to jaw give battle to them alone in such remotest waters that though you sailed a thousand miles and passed a thousand shores you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun in such latitudes and longitudes pursuing too such a calling as he does the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth no wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the white whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies which eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears so that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the white whale few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work not even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm whale as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body there are those this day among them who though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale would perhaps -- either from professional inexperience or incompetency or timidity decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there are plenty of whalemen especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the american flag who have never hostilely encountered the sperm whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north seated on their hatches these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe to the wild strange tales of southern whaling nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prows which stem him and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it we find some book naturalists -- olassen and povelson -- declaring the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood nor even down to so late a time as cuvier's were these or almost similar impressions effaced for in his natural history the baron himself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale all fish sharks included are struck with the most lively terrors and often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death and however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these yet in their full terribleness even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson the superstitious belief in them is in some vicissitudes of their vocation revived in the minds of the hunters so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him not a few of the fishermen recalled in reference to moby dick the earlier days of the sperm whale fishery when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the sperm whale was not for mortal man that to attempt it would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity on this head there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted nevertheless some there were who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to moby dick and a still greater number who chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without the specific details of any certain calamity and without superstitious accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered one of the wild suggestions referred to as at last coming to be linked with the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time nor credulous as such minds must have been was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability for as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged even to the most erudite research so the hidden ways of the sperm whale when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to his pursuers and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them especially concerning the mystic modes whereby after sounding to a great depth he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points it is a thing well known to both american and english whale-ships and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby that some whales have been captured far north in the pacific in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland seas nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days hence by inference it has been believed by some whalemen that the nor' west passage so long a problem to man was never a problem to the whale so that here in the real living experience of living men the prodigies related in old times of the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse whose waters were believed to have come from the holy land by an underground passage these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen forced into familiarity then with such prodigies as these and knowing that after repeated intrepid assaults the white whale had escaped alive it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions declaring moby dick not only ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is but ubiquity in time that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks he would still swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away his unsullied jet would once more be seen but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power for it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales but as was elsewhere thrown out -- a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump these were his prominent features the tokens whereby even in the limitless uncharted seas he revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him the rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden gleamings nor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet his deformed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural terror as that unexampled intelligent malignity which according to specific accounts he had over and over again evinced in his assaults more than all his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else for when swimming before his exulting pursuers with every apparent symptom of alarm he had several times been known to turn round suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave their boats to splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ship already several fatalities had attended his chase but though similar disasters however little bruited ashore were by no means unusual in the fishery yet in most instances such seemed the white whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death that he caused was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent judge then to what pitches of inflamed distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips of chewed boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene exasperating sunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridal his three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling in the eddies one captain seizing the line-knife from his broken prow had dashed at the whale as an arkansas duellist at his foe blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale that captain was ahab and then it was that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him moby dick had reaped away ahab's leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field no turbaned turk no hired venetian or malay could have smote him with more seeming malice small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woes but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations the white whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung that intangible malignity which has been from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe one-half of the worlds which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil -- ahab did not fall down and worship it like them but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it all that most maddens and torments all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with malice in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain all the subtle demonisms of life and thought all evil to crazy ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in moby dick he piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down and then as if his chest had been a mortar he burst his hot heart's shell upon it it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment then in darting at the monster knife in hand he had but given loose to a sudden passionate corporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more yet when by this collision forced to turn towards home and for long months of days and weeks ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling patagonian cape then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another and so interfusing made him mad that it was only then on the homeward voyage after the encounter that the final monomania seized him seems all but certain from the fact that at intervals during the passage he was a raving lunatic and though unlimbed of a leg yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest and was moreover intensified by his delirium that his mates were forced to lace him fast even there as he sailed raving in his hammock in a strait-jacket he swung to the mad rockings of the gales and when running into more sufferable latitudes the ship with mild stun'sails spread floated across the tranquil tropics and to all appearances the old man's delirium seemed left behind him with the cape horn swells and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air even then when he bore that firm collected front however pale and issued his calm orders once again and his mates thanked god the direful madness was now gone even then ahab in his hidden self raved on human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing when you think it fled it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form ahab's full lunacy subsided not but deepeningly contracted like the unabated hudson when that noble northman flows narrowly but unfathomably through the highland gorge but as in his narrow-flowing monomania not one jot of ahab's broad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished that before living agent now became the living instrument if such a furious trope may stand his special lunacy stormed his general sanity and carried it and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that far from having lost his strength ahab to that one end did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object this is much yet ahab's larger darker deeper part remains unhinted but vain to popularize profundities and all truth is profound winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where we here stand -- however grand and wonderful now quit it -- and take your way ye nobler sadder souls to those vast roman halls of thermes where far beneath the fantastic towers of man's upper earth his root of grandeur his whole awful essence sits in bearded state an antique buried beneath antiquities and throned on torsoes so with a broken throne the great gods mock that captive king so like a caryatid he patient sits upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages wind ye down there ye prouder sadder souls question that proud sad king a family likeness aye he did beget ye ye young exiled royalties and from your grim sire only will the old state-secret come now in his heart ahab had some glimpse of this namely all my means are sane my motive and my object mad yet without power to kill or change or shun the fact he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble in some sort did still but that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility not to his will determinate nevertheless so well did he succeed in that dissembling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause and so too all the added moodiness which always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the present voyage sat brooding on his brow nor is it so very unlikely that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage on account of such dark symptoms the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales gnawed within and scorched without with the infixed unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes or if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack but be all this as it may certain it is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the white whale had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man they were bent on profitable cruises the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint he was intent on an audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge here then was this grey-headed ungodly old man chasing with curses a job's whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly made up of mongrel renegades and castaways and cannibals -- morally enfeebled also by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in starbuck the invunerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in stubb and the pervading mediocrity in flask such a crew so officered seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge how it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man's ire -- by what evil magic their souls were possessed that at times his hate seemed almost theirs the white whale as much their insufferable foe as his how all this came to be -- what the white whale was to them or how to their unconscious understandings also in some dim unsuspected way he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life -- all this to explain would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go the subterranean miner that works in us all how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting muffled sound of his pick who does not feel the irresistible arm drag what skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand still for one i gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill chapter 42 the whiteness of the whale what the white whale was to ahab has been hinted what at times he was to me as yet remains unsaid aside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick which could not but occasionally awaken in any man's soul some alarm there was another thought or rather vague nameless horror concerning him which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it that i almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form it was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me but how can i hope to explain myself here and yet in some dim random way explain myself i must else all these chapters might be naught though in many natural objects whiteness refiningly enhances beauty as if imparting some special virtue of its own as in marbles japonicas and pearls and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old kings of pegu placing the title lord of the white elephants above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion and the modern kings of siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger and the great austrian empire caesarian heir to overlording rome having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all this whiteness has been even made significant of gladness for among the romans a white stone marked a joyful day and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings this same hue is made the emblem of many touching noble things -- the innocence of brides the benignity of age though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour though in many climes whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power by the persian fire worshippers the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar and in the greek mythologies great jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull and though to the noble iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology that spotless faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity and though directly from the latin word for white all christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture the alb or tunic worn beneath the cassock and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith white is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord though in the vision of st john white robes are given to the redeemed and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white throne and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool yet for all these accumulated associations with whatever is sweet and honourable and sublime there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood this elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whiteness when divorced from more kindly associations and coupled with any object terrible in itself to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds witness the white bear of the poles and the white shark of the tropics what but their smooth flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb gloating of their aspect so that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark with reference to the polar bear it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not the whiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened hideousness it might be said only rises from the circumstance that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds the polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast but even assuming all this to be true yet were it not for the whiteness you would not have that intensified terror as for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallies with the same quality in the polar quadruped this peculiarity is most vividly hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish the romish mass for the dead begins with requiem eternam eternal rest whence requiem denominating the mass itself and any other funeral music now in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark and the mild deadliness of his habits the french call him requin bethink thee of the albatross whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations not coleridge first threw that spell but god's great unflattering laureate nature i remember the first albatross i ever saw it was during a prolonged gale in waters hard upon the antarctic seas from my forenoon watch below i ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the main hatches i saw a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and with a hooked roman bill sublime at intervals it arched forth its vast archangel wings as if to embrace some holy ark wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it though bodily unharmed it uttered cries as some king's ghost in supernatural distress through its inexpressible strange eyes methought i peeped to secrets which took hold of god as abraham before the angels i bowed myself the white thing was so white its wings so wide and in those for ever exiled waters i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage i cannot tell can only hint the things that darted through me then but at last i awoke and turning asked a sailor what bird was this a goney he replied goney never had heard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore never but some time after i learned that goney was some seaman's name for albatross so that by no possibility could coleridge's wild rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine when i saw that bird upon our deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor knew the bird to be an albatross yet in saying this i do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet i assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced in this that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses and these i have frequently seen but never with such emotions as when i beheld the antarctic fowl but how had the mystic thing been caught whisper it not and i will tell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowl floated on the sea at last the captain made a postman of it tying a lettered leathern tally round its neck with the ship's time and place and then letting it escape but i doubt not that leathern tally meant for man was taken off in heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding the invoking and adoring cherubim most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that of the white steed of the prairies a magnificent milk-white charger large-eyed small-headed bluff-chested and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty overscorning carriage he was the elected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies at their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light the flashing cascade of his mane the curving comet of his tail invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western world which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains like an ohio or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon the white steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness in whatever aspect he presented himself always to the bravest indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly which so clothed him with divineness and that this divineness had that in it which though commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror but there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed and albatross what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin it is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the name he bears the albino is as well made as other men -- has no substantive deformity -- and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion why should this be so nor in quite other aspects does nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible from its snowy aspect the gauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the white squall nor in some historic instances has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary how wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their faction the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place nor in some things does the common hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue it cannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingering there as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here and from that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog -- yea while these terrors seize us let us add that even the king of terrors when personified by the evangelist rides on his pallid horse therefore in his other moods symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul but though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortal man to account for it to analyse it would seem impossible can we then by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness -- though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful but nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorcery however modified -- can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek let us try but in a matter like this subtlety appeals to subtlety and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls and though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time and therefore may not be able to recall them now why to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day does the bare mention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims down-cast and hooded with new-fallen snow or to the unread unsophisticated protestant of the middle american states why does the passing mention of a white friar or a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings which will not wholly account for it that makes the white tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled american than those other storied structures its neighbors -- the byward tower or even the bloody and those sublimer towers the white mountains of new hampshire whence in peculiar moods comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name while the thought of virginia's blue ridge is full of a soft dewy distant dreaminess or why irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes does the name of the white sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets or to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed to the fancy why in reading the old fairy tales of central europe does the tall pale man of the hartz forests whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves -- why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the blocksburg nor is it altogether the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling earthquakes nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires wrenched cope-stones and crosses all adroop like canted yards of anchored fleets and her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other as a tossed pack of cards -- it is not these things alone which make tearless lima the strangest saddest city thou can'st see for lima has taken the white veil and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe old as pizarro this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions i know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality what i mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples first the mariner when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands if by night he hear the roar of breakers starts to vigilance and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties but under precisely similar circumstances let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness -- as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him then he feels a silent superstitious dread the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings heart and helm they both go down he never rests till blue water is under him again yet where is the mariner who will tell thee sir it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me second to the native indian of peru the continual sight of the snowhowdahed andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the west who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness not so the sailor beholding the scenery of the antarctic seas where at times by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air he shivering and half shipwrecked instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses but thou sayest methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a hypo ishmael tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of vermont far removed from all beasts of prey -- why is it that upon the sunniest day if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that he cannot even see it but only smells its wild animal muskiness -- why will he start snort and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright there is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils for what knows he this new england colt of the black bisons of distant oregon no but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world though thousands of miles from oregon still when he smells that savage musk the rending goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies which this instant they may be trampling into dust thus then the muffled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies all these to ishmael are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints yet with me as with the colt somewhere those things must exist though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love the invisible spheres were formed in fright but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul and more strange and far more portentous -- why as we have seen it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things nay the very veil of the christian's deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of the milky way or is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all colours is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness full of meaning in a wide landscape of snows -- a colourless all-colour of atheism from which we shrink and when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers that all other earthly hues -- every stately or lovely emblazoning -- the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods yea and the gilded velvets of butterflies and the butterfly cheeks of young girls all these are but subtile deceits not actually inherent in substances but only laid on from without so that all deified nature absolutely paints like the harlot whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within and when we proceed further and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues the great principle of light for ever remains white or colourless in itself and if operating without medium upon matter would touch all objects even tulips and roses with its own blank tinge -- pondering all this the palsied universe lies before us a leper and like wilful travellers in lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him and of all these things the albino whale was the symbol wonder ye then at the fiery hunt chapter 43 hark hist did you hear that noise cabaco it was the middle-watch a fair moonlight the seamen were standing in a cordon extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail in this manner they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt standing for the most part on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet from hand to hand the buckets went in the deepest silence only broken by the occasional flap of a sail and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel it was in the midst of this repose that archy one of the cordon whose post was near the after-hatches whispered to his neighbor a cholo the words above hist did you hear that noise cabaco take the bucket will ye archy what noise d'ye mean there it is again -- under the hatches -- don't you hear it -- a cough -- it sounded like a cough cough be damned pass along that return bucket there again -- there it is -- it sounds like two or three sleepers turning over now caramba have done shipmate will ye it's the three soaked biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye -- nothing else look to the bucket say what ye will shipmate i've sharp ears aye you are the chap ain't ye that heard the hum of the old quakeress's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from nantucket you're the chap grin away we'll see what turns up hark ye cabaco there is somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck and i suspect our old mogul knows something of it too i heard stubb tell flask one morning watch that there was something of that sort in the wind tish the bucket chapter 44 the chart had you followed captain ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts spread them before him on his screwed-down table then seating himself before it you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank at intervals he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him wherein were set down the seasons and places in which on various former voyages of various ships sperm whales had been captured or seen while thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead but it was not this night in particular that in the solitude of his cabin ahab thus pondered over his charts almost every night they were brought out almost every night some pencil marks were effaced and others were substituted for with the charts of all four oceans before him ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul now to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet but not so did it seem to ahab who knew the sets of all tides and currents and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food and also calling to mind the regular ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes could arrive at reasonable surmises almost approaching to certainties concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey so assured indeed is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale's resorting to given waters that many hunters believe that could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows on this hint attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale since the above was written the statement is happily borne out by an official circular issued by lieutenant maury of the national observatory washington april 16th 1851 by that circular it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion and portions of it are presented in the circular this chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district and the two others to show the number of days in which whales sperm or right have been seen besides when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another the sperm whales guided by some infallible instinct -- say rather secret intelligence from the deity -- mostly swim in veins as they are called continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating exactitude that no ship ever sailed her course by any chart with one tithe of such marvellous precision though in these cases the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor's parallel and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times he is said to swim generally embraces some few miles in width more or less as the vein is presumed to expand or contract but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship's mast-heads when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone the sum is that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for and hence not only at substantiated times upon well known separate feeding-grounds could ahab hope to encounter his prey but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could by his art so place and time himself on his way as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting there was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme but not so in the reality perhaps though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year say will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true in general the same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales so that though moby dick had in a former year been seen for example on what is called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on the japanese coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly encounter him there so too with some other feeding grounds where he had at times revealed himself but all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns so to speak not his places of prolonged abode and where ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of allusion has only been made to whatever way-side antecedent extra prospects were his ere a particular set time or place were attained when all possibilities would become probabilities and as ahab fondly thought every possibility the next thing to a certainty that particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase -- the season-on-the-line for there and then for several consecutive years moby dick had been periodically descried lingering in those waters for awhile as the sun in its annual round loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the zodiac there it was too that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place there the waves were storied with his deeds there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned however flattering it might be to those hopes nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest now the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of the season-on-the-line no possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards double cape horn and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time to cruise there therefore he must wait for the next ensuing season yet the premature hour of the pequod's sailing had perhaps been correctly selected by ahab with a view to this very complexion of things because an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before him an interval which instead of impatiently enduring ashore he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt if by chance the white whale spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds should turn up his wrinkled brow off the persian gulf or in the bengal bay or china seas or in any other waters haunted by his race so that monsoons pampas nor'-westers harmattans trades any wind but the levanter and simoon might blow moby dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the pequod's circumnavigating wake but granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even as a white-bearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople yes for the peculiar snow-white brow of moby dick and his snow-white hump could not but be unmistakable and have i not tallied the whale ahab would mutter to himself as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries -- tallied him and shall he escape his broad fins are bored and scalloped out like a lost sheep's ear and here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength ah god what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire he sleeps with clenched hands and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms often when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night which resuming his own intense thoughts through the day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish and when as was sometimes the case these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base and a chasm seemed opening in him from which forked flames and lightnings shot up and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them when this hell in himself yawned beneath him a wild cry would be heard through the ship and with glaring eyes ahab would burst from his state room as though escaping from a bed that was on fire yet these perhaps instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness or fright at his own resolve were but the plainest tokens of its intensity for at such times crazy ahab the scheming unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahab that had gone to his hammock was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again the latter was the eternal living principle or soul in him and in sleep being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time it was no longer an integral but as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul therefore it must have been that in ahab's case yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose that purpose by its own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed independent being of its own nay could grimly live and burn while the common vitality to which it was conjoined fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes when what seemed ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be sure but without an object to colour and therefore a blankness in itself god help thee old man thy thoughts have created a creature in thee and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a prometheus a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever that vulture the very creature he creates chapter 45 the affidavit so far as what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeed as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales the foregoing chapter in its earlier part is as important a one as will be found in this volume but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon in order to be adequately understood and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair i care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman and from these citations i take it -- the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself first i have personally known three instances where a whale after receiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and after an interval in one instance of three years has been again struck by the same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same private cypher have been taken from the body in the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons and i think it may have been something more than that the man who darted them happening in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage to africa went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated far into the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two years often endangered by serpents savages tigers poisonous miasmas with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions meanwhile the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe brushing with its flanks all the coasts of africa but to no purpose this man and this whale again came together and the one vanquished the other i say i myself have known three instances similar to this that is in two of them i saw the whales struck and upon the second attack saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them afterwards taken from the dead fish in the three-year instance it so fell out that i was in the boat both times first and last and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye which i had observed there three years previous i say three years but i am pretty sure it was more than that here are three instances then which i personally know the truth of but i have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach secondly it is well known in the sperm whale fishery however ignorant the world ashore may be of it that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil no the reason was this that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street lest if they pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for their presumption but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity -- nay you may call it an ocean-wide renown not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death but he was admitted into all the rights privileges and distinctions of a name had as much a name indeed as cambyses or caesar was it not so o timor tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long did'st lurk in the oriental straits of that name whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of ombay was it not so o new zealand jack thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the tattoo land was it not so o morquan king of japan whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky was it not so o don miguel thou chilian whale marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back in plain prose here are four whales as well known to the students of cetacean history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar but this is not all new zealand tom and don miguel after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels were finally gone in quest of systematically hunted out chased and killed by valiant whaling captains who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view as in setting out through the narragansett woods captain butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior of the indian king philip i do not know where i can find a better place than just here to make mention of one or two other things which to me seem important as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe for this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error so ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world that without some hints touching the plain facts historical and otherwise of the fishery they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable or still worse and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory first though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vivid conception of those perils and the frequency with which they recur one reason perhaps is that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery ever finds a public record at home however transient and immediately forgotten that record do you suppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of new guinea is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan -- do you suppose that that poor fellow's name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast no because the mails are very irregular between here and new guinea in fact did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea yet i tell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific among many others we spoke thirty different ships every one of which had had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each lost a boat's crew for god's sake be economical with your lamps and candles not a gallon you burn but at least one drop of man's blood was spilled for it secondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power but i have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness when i declare upon my soul i had no more idea of being facetious than moses when he wrote the history of the plagues of egypt but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own that point is this the sperm whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously malicious as with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and sink a large ship and what is more the sperm whale has done it first in the year 1820 the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket was cruising in the pacific ocean one day she saw spouts lowered her boats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales ere long several of the whales were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escaping from the boats issued from the shoal and bore directly down upon the ship dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove her in that in less than ten minutes she settled down and fell over not a surviving plank of her has been seen since after the severest exposure part of the crew reached the land in their boats being returned home at last captain pollard once more sailed for the pacific in command of another ship but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers for the second time his ship was utterly lost and forthwith forswearing the sea he has never tempted it since at this day captain pollard is a resident of nantucket i have seen owen chace who was chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy i have read his plain and faithful narrative i have conversed with his son and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe the following are extracts from chace's narrative every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations he made two several attacks upon the ship at a short interval between them both of which according to their direction were calculated to do us the most injury by being made ahead and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock to effect which the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary his aspect was most horrible and such as indicated resentment and fury he came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered and in which we had struck three of his companions as if fired with revenge for their sufferings again at all events the whole circumstances taken together all happening before my own eyes and producing at the time impressions in my mind of decided calculating mischief on the part of the whale many of which impressions i cannot now recall induce me to be satisfied that i am correct in my opinion here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship during a black night an open boat when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed upon hidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought the dismal looking wreck and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale wholly engrossed my reflections until day again made its appearance in another place -- p 45 -- he speaks of the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal secondly the ship union also of nantucket was in the year 1807 totally lost off the azores by a similar onset but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter though from the whale hunters i have now and then heard casual allusions to it thirdly some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j -- - then commanding an american sloop-of-war of the first class happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains on board a nantucket ship in the harbor of oahu sandwich islands conversation turning upon whales the commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present he peremptorily denied for example that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful very good but there is more coming some weeks after the commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for valparaiso but he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale that begged a few moments' confidential business with him that business consisted in fetching the commodore's craft such a thwack that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair i am not superstitious but i consider the commodore's interview with that whale as providential was not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright i tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsense i will now refer you to langsdorff's voyages for a little circumstance in point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof langsdorff you must know by the way was attached to the russian admiral krusenstern's famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail and the next day we were out in the open sea on our way to ochotsh the weather was very clear and fine but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing for some days we had very little wind it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up an uncommon large whale the body of which was larger than the ship itself lay almost at the surface of the water but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship which was in full sail was almost upon him so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him we were thus placed in the most imminent danger as this gigantic creature setting up its back raised the ship three feet at least out of the water the masts reeled and the sails fell altogether while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struck upon some rock instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity captain d'wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured now the captain d'wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question is a new englander who after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea-captain this day resides in the village of dorchester near boston i have the honour of being a nephew of his i have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorff he substantiates every word the ship however was by no means a large one a russian craft built on the siberian coast and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home in that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure so full too of honest wonders -- the voyage of lionel wafer one of ancient dampier's old chums -- i found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from langsdorff that i cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example if such be needed lionel it seems was on his way to john ferdinando as he calls the modern juan fernandes in our way thither he says about four o'clock in the morning when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the main of america our ship felt a terrible shock which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think but every one began to prepare for death and indeed the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement was a little over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground the suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks captain davis who lay with his head on a gun was thrown out of his cabin lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake somewhere about that time did actually do great mischief along the spanish land but i should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath i might proceed with several more examples one way or another known to me of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale in more than one instance he has been known not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships but to pursue the ship itself and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head and as for his strength let me say that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and secured there the whale towing her great hull through the water as a horse walks off with a cart again it is very often observed that if the sperm whale once struck is allowed time to rally he then acts not so often with blind rage as with wilful deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes but i must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration a remarkable and most significant one by which you will not fail to see that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day but that these marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomon -- verily there is nothing new under the sun in the sixth christian century lived procopius a christian magistrate of constantinople in the days when justinian was emperor and belisarius general as many know he wrote the history of his own times a work every way of uncommon value by the best authorities he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in some one or two particulars not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned now in this history of his procopius mentions that during the term of his prefecture at constantinople a great sea-monster was captured in the neighboring propontis or sea of marmora after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid nor is there any reason it should be of what precise species this sea-monster was is not mentioned but as he destroyed ships as well as for other reasons he must have been a whale and i am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale and i will tell you why for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it even now i am certain that those seas are not and perhaps never can be in the present constitution of things a place for his habitual gregarious resort but further investigations have recently proved to me that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good authority that on the barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale now as a vessel of war readily passes through the dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis in the propontis as far as i can learn none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found the aliment of the right whale but i have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale -- squid or cuttle-fish -- lurks at the bottom of that sea because large creatures but by no means the largest of that sort have been found at its surface if then you properly put these statements together and reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that according to all human reasoning procopius's sea-monster that for half a century stove the ships of a roman emperor must in all probability have been a sperm whale chapter 46 surmises though consumed with the hot fire of his purpose ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby dick though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage or at least if this were otherwise there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him it would be refining too much perhaps even considering his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards the white whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted but if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable there were still additional considerations which though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion yet were by no means incapable of swaying him to accomplish his object ahab must use tools and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order he knew for example that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation starbuck's body and starbuck's coerced will were ahab's so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbuck's brain still he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred his captain's quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from it or even frustrate it it might be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whale was seen during that long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him not only that but the subtle insanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that for the present the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background for few men's courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action that when they stood their long night watches his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than moby dick for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable -- they live in the varying outer weather and they inhale its fickleness -- and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in the end it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash nor was ahab unmindful of another thing in times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations but such times are evanescent the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought ahab is sordidness granting that the white whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them still while for the love of it they give chase to moby dick they must also have food for their more common daily appetites for even the high lifted and chivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre without committing burglaries picking pockets and gaining other pious perquisites by the way had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object -- that final and romantic object too many would have turned from in disgust i will not strip these men thought ahab of all hopes of cash -- aye cash they may scorn cash now but let some months go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon cashier ahab nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally having impulsively it is probable and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the pequod's voyage ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crew if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further obedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command from even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself that protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand backed by a heedful closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to for all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the pequod's voyage observe all customary usages and not only that but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession be all this as it may his voice was now often heard hailing the three mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out and not omit reporting even a porpoise this vigilance was not long without reward chapter 47 the mat-maker it was a cloudy sultry afternoon the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat for an additional lashing to our boat so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self i was the attendant or page of queequeg while busy at the mat as i kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp using my own hand for the shuttle and as queequeg standing sideways ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads and idly looking off upon the water carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn i say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword that it seemed as if this were the loom of time and i myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the fates there lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single ever returning unchanging vibration and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own this warp seemed necessity and here thought i with my own hand i ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads meantime queequeg's impulsive indifferent sword sometimes hitting the woof slantingly or crookedly or strongly or weakly as the case might be and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric this savage's sword thought i which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof this easy indifferent sword must be chance -- aye chance free will and necessity -- nowise incompatible -- all interweavingly working together the straight warp of necessity not to be swerved from its ultimate course -- its every alternating vibration indeed only tending to that free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads and chance though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity and sideways in its motions directed by free will though thus prescribed to by both chance by turns rules either and has the last featuring blow at events thus we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a sound so strange long drawn and musically wild and unearthly that the ball of free will dropped from my hand and i stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing high aloft in the cross-trees was that mad gay-header tashtego his body was reaching eagerly forward his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries to be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas from hundreds of whalemen's look-outs perched as high in the air but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from tashtego the indian's as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate and by those wild cries announcing their coming there she blows there there there she blows she blows where-away on the lee-beam about two miles off a school of them instantly all was commotion the sperm whale blows as a clock ticks with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity and thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus there go flukes was now the cry from tashtego and the whales disappeared quick steward cried ahab time time dough-boy hurried below glanced at the watch and reported the exact minute to ahab the ship was now kept away from the wind and she went gently rolling before it tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale when sounding with his head in one direction he nevertheless while concealed beneath the surface mills round and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter -- this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by tashtego had been in any way alarmed or indeed knew at all of our vicinity one of the men selected for shipkeepers -- that is those not appointed to the boats by this time relieved the indian at the main-mast head the sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down the line tubs were fixed in their places the cranes were thrust out the mainyard was backed and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale so look the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw themselves on board an enemy's ship but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale with a start all glared at dark ahab who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air chapter 48 the first lowering the phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the other side of the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there this boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats though technically called the captain's on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter the figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff but strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head less swart in aspect the companions of this figure were of that vivid tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the manillas -- a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil their lord whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere while yet the wondering ship's company were gazing upon these strangers ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head all ready there fedallah ready was the half-hissed reply lower away then d'ye hear shouting across the deck lower away there i say such was the thunder of his voice that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blocks with a wallow the three boats dropped into the sea while with a dexterous off-handed daring unknown in any other vocation the sailors goat-like leaped down the rolling ship's side into the tossed boats below hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee when a fourth keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and showed the five strangers rowing ahab who standing erect in the stern loudly hailed starbuck stubb and flask to spread themselves widely so as to cover a large expanse of water but with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command captain ahab -- said starbuck spread yourselves cried ahab give way all four boats thou flask pull out more to leeward aye aye sir cheerily cried little king-post sweeping round his great steering oar lay back addressing his crew there -- there -- there again there she blows right ahead boys -- lay back never heed yonder yellow boys archy oh i don't mind'em sir said archy i knew it all before now didn't i hear 'em in the hold and didn't i tell cabaco here of it what say ye cabaco they are stowaways mr flask pull pull my fine hearts-alive pull my children pull my little ones drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb to his crew some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness why don't you break your backbones my boys what is it you stare at those chaps in yonder boat tut they are only five more hands come to help us -- never mind from where -- the more the merrier pull then do pull never mind the brimstone -- devils are good fellows enough so so there you are now that's the stroke for a thousand pounds that's the stroke to sweep the stakes hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil my heroes three cheers men -- all hearts alive easy easy don't be in a hurry -- don't be in a hurry why don't you snap your oars you rascals bite something you dogs so so so then -- softly softly that's it -- that's it long and strong give way there give way the devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallions ye are all asleep stop snoring ye sleepers and pull pull will ye pull can't ye pull won't ye why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don't ye pull -- pull and break something pull and start your eyes out here whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle every mother's son of ye draw his knife and pull with the blade between his teeth that's it -- that's it now ye do something that looks like it my steel-bits start her -- start her my silver-spoons start her marling-spikes stubb's exordium to his crew is given here at large because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing but you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation not at all and therein consisted his chief peculiarity he would say the most terrific things to his crew in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself so loungingly managed his steering-oar and so broadly gaped -- open-mouthed at times -- that the mere sight of such a yawning commander by sheer force of contrast acted like a charm upon the crew then again stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them in obedience to a sign from ahab starbuck was now pulling obliquely across stubb's bow and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other stubb hailed the mate mr starbuck larboard boat there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye please halloa returned starbuck turning round not a single inch as he spoke still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew his face set like a flint from stubb's what think ye of those yellow boys sir smuggled on board somehow before the ship sailed strong strong boys in a whisper to his crew then speaking out loud again a sad business mr stubb seethe her seethe her my lads but never mind mr stubb all for the best let all your crew pull strong come what will spring my men spring there's hogsheads of sperm ahead mr stubb and that's what ye came for pull my boys sperm sperm's the play this at least is duty duty and profit hand in hand aye aye i thought as much soliloquized stubb when the boats diverged as soon as i clapt eye on 'em i thought so aye and that's what he went into the after hold for so often as dough-boy long suspected they were hidden down there the white whale's at the bottom of it well well so be it can't be helped all right give way men it ain't the white whale to-day give way now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship's company but archy's fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them though indeed not credited then this had in some small measure prepared them for the event it took off the extreme edge of their wonder and so what with all this and stubb's confident way of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark ahab's precise agency in the matter from the beginning for me i silently recalled the mysterious shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the dim nantucket dawn as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable elijah meantime ahab out of hearing of his officers having sided the furthest to windward was still ranging ahead of the other boats a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer as for fedallah who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like a fencer's thrown half backward into the air as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him all at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked boat and crew sat motionless on the sea instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way the whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it every man look out along his oars cried starbuck thou queequeg stand up nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow the savage stood erect there and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea not very far distant flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform it is used for catching turns with the whale line its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man's hand and standing upon such a base as that flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks but little king-post was small and short and at the same time little king-post was full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means satisfy king-post i can't see three seas off tip us up an oar there and let me on to that upon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way swiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal good a mast-head as any sir will you mount that i will and thank ye very much my fine fellow only i wish you fifty feet taller whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his flat palm to flask's foot and then putting flask's hand on his hearse-plumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders and here was flask now standing daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross-running seas still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstances but the sight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more curious for sustaining himself with a cool indifferent easy unthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form on his broad back flaxen-haired flask seemed a snow-flake the bearer looked nobler than the rider though truly vivacious tumultuous ostentatious little flask would now and then stamp with impatience but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro's lordly chest so have i seen passion and vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that meanwhile stubb the third mate betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes the whales might have made one of their regular soundings not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that were the case stubb as his wont in such cases it seems was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe he withdrew it from his hatband where he always wore it aslant like a feather he loaded it and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand when tashtego his harpooneer whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry down down all and give way -- there they are to a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have been visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it and suffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from white rolling billows the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled as it were like the air over intensely heated plates of iron beneath this atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of water also the whales were swimming seen in advance of all the other indications the puffs of vapour they spouted seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders all four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air but it bade fair to outstrip them it flew on and on as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills pull pull my good boys said starbuck in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses he did not say much to his crew though nor did his crew say anything to him only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers now harsh with command now soft with entreaty how different the loud little king-post sing out and say something my hearties roar and pull my thunderbolts beach me beach me on their black backs boys only do that for me and i'll sign over to you my martha's vineyard plantation boys including wife and children boys lay me on -- lay me on o lord lord but i shall go stark staring mad see see that white water and so shouting he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted it far off upon the sea and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat's stern like a crazed colt from the prairie look at that chap now philosophically drawled stubb who with his unlighted short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at a short distance followed after -- he's got fits that flask has fits yes give him fits -- that's the very word -- pitch fits into 'em merrily merrily hearts-alive pudding for supper you know -- merry's the word pull babes -- pull sucklings -- pull all but what the devil are you hurrying about softly softly and steadily my men only pull and keep pulling nothing more crack all your backbones and bite your knives in two -- that's all take it easy -- why don't ye take it easy i say and burst all your livers and lungs but what it was that inscrutable ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of his -- these were words best omitted here for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words when with tornado brow and eyes of red murder and foam-glued lips ahab leaped after his prey meanwhile all the boats tore on the repeated specific allusions of flask to that whale as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat's bow with its tail -- these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder but this was against all rule for the oarsmen must put out their eyes and ram a skewer through their necks usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears and no limbs but arms in these critical moments it was a sight full of quick wonder and awe the vast swells of the omnipotent sea the surging hollow roar they made as they rolled along the eight gunwales like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green the brief suspended agony of the boat as it would tip for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill the headlong sled-like slide down its other side -- all these with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails like a wild hen after her screaming brood -- all this was thrilling not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle not the dead man's ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world -- neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed churned circle of the hunted sperm whale the dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung upon the sea the jets of vapour no longer blended but tilted everywhere to right and left the whales seemed separating their wakes the boats were pulled more apart starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward our sail was now set and with the still rising wind we rushed along the boat going with such madness through the water that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row-locks soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist neither ship nor boat to be seen give way men whispered starbuck drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes there's white water again -- close to spring soon after two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast but hardly were they overheard when with a lightning-like hurtling whisper starbuck said stand up and queequeg harpoon in hand sprang to his feet though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the imminent instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents that's his hump there there give it to him whispered starbuck a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it was the darted iron of queequeg then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge the sail collapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapour shot up near by something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us the whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall squall whale and harpoon had all blended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped though completely swamped the boat was nearly unharmed swimming round it we picked up the floating oars and lashing them across the gunwale tumbled back to our places there we sat up to our knees in the sea the water covering every rib and plank so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean the wind increased to a howl the waves dashed their bucklers together the whole squall roared forked and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal in these jaws of death in vain we hailed the other boats as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm meanwhile the driving scud rack and mist grew darker with the shadows of night no sign of the ship could be seen the rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat the oars were useless as propellers performing now the office of life-preservers so cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failures starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretching it on a waif pole handed it to queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope there then he sat holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness there then he sat the sign and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair wet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship or boat we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on the mist still spread over the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat suddenly queequeg started to his feet hollowing his hand to his ear we all heard a faint creaking as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm the sound came nearer and nearer the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge vague form affrighted we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship's bows like a chip at the base of a cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern again we swam for it were dashed against it by the seas and were at last taken up and safely landed on board ere the squall came close to the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time the ship had given us up but was still cruising if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing -- an oar or a lance pole chapter 49 the hyena there are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own however nothing dispirits and nothing seems worth while disputing he bolts down all events all creeds and beliefs and persuasions all hard things visible and invisible never mind how knobby as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints and as for small difficulties and worryings prospects of sudden disaster peril of life and limb all these and death itself seem to him only sly good-natured hits and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker that odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking of comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation it comes in the very midst of his earnestness so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous now seems but a part of the general joke there is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with it i now regarded this whole voyage of the pequod and the great white whale its object queequeg said i when they had dragged me the last man to the deck and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water queequeg my fine friend does this sort of thing often happen without much emotion though soaked through just like me he gave me to understand that such things did often happen mr stubb said i turning to that worthy who buttoned up in his oil-jacket was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain mr stubb i think i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief mate mr starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent i suppose then that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman's discretion certain i've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off cape horn mr flask said i turning to little king-post who was standing close by you are experienced in these things and i am not will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery mr flask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death's jaws can't you twist that smaller said flask yes that's the law i should like to see a boat's crew backing water up to a whale face foremost ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mind that here then from three impartial witnesses i had a deliberate statement of the entire case considering therefore that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat -- oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to starbuck's driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall and considering that starbuck notwithstanding was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery considering that i belonged to this uncommonly prudent starbuck's boat and finally considering in what a devil's chase i was implicated touching the white whale taking all things together i say i thought i might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will queequeg said i come along you shall be my lawyer executor and legatee it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion this was the fourth time in my nautical life that i had done the same thing after the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion i felt all the easier a stone was rolled away from my heart besides all the days i should now live would be as good as the days that lazarus lived after his resurrection a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be i survived myself my death and burial were locked up in my chest i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault now then thought i unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock here goes for a cool collected dive at death and destruction and the devil fetch the hindmost chapter 50 ahab's boat and crew fedallah who would have thought it flask cried stubb if i had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my timber toe oh he's a wonderful old man i don't think it so strange after all on that account said flask if his leg were off at the hip now it would be a different thing that would disable him but he has one knee and good part of the other left you know i don't know that my little man i never yet saw him kneel among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase so tamerlane's soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties that every individual moment indeed then comprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt as a general thing the joint-owners of the pequod must have plainly thought not ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt -- above all for captain ahab to be supplied with five extra men as that same boat's crew he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the pequod therefore he had not solicited a boat's crew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter until cabaco's published discovery the sailors had little foreseen it though to be sure when after being a little while out of port all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service when some time after this ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this was observed in him and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat as it is sometimes called the horizontal piece in the boat's bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat and with the carpenter's chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there all these things i say had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time but almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of moby dick for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person but such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat's crew being assigned to that boat now with the subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon waned away for in a whaler wonders soon wane besides now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks bits of wreck oars whaleboats canoes blown-off japanese junks and what not that beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle but be all this as it may certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew though still as it were somehow distinct from them yet that hair-turbaned fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last whence he came in a mannerly world like this by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with ahab's peculiar fortunes nay so far as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence heaven knows but it might have been even authority over him all this none knew but one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning fedallah he was such a creature as civilized domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams and that but dimly but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging asiatic communities especially the oriental isles to the east of the continent -- those insulated immemorial unalterable countries which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth's primal generations when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection and all men his descendants unknowing whence he came eyed each other as real phantoms and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end when though according to genesis the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men the devils also add the uncanonical rabbins indulged in mundane amours chapter 51 the spirit-spout days weeks passed and under easy sail the ivory pequod had slowly swept across four several cruising-grounds that off the azores off the cape de verdes on the plate so called being off the mouth of the rio de la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked watery locality southerly from st helena it was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver and by their soft suffusing seethings made what seemed a silvery silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow lit up by the moon it looked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea fedallah first descried this jet for of these moonlight nights it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head and stand a look-out there with the same precision as if it had been day and yet though herds of whales were seen by night not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them you may think with what emotions then the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours his turban and the moon companions in one sky but when after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound when after all this silence his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moon-lit jet every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew there she blows had the trump of judgment blown they could not have quivered more yet still they felt no terror rather pleasure for though it was a most unwonted hour yet so impressive was the cry and so deliriously exciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering walking the deck with quick side-lunging strides ahab commanded the t'gallant sails and royals to be set and every stunsail spread the best man in the ship must take the helm then with every mast-head manned the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind the strange upheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails made the buoyant hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet while still she rushed along as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her -- one to mount direct to heaven the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and had you watched ahab's face that night you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring while his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap on life and death this old man walked but though the ship so swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrows the eager glances shot yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night every sailor swore he saw it once but not a second time this midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing when some days after lo at the same silent hour it was again announced again it was descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it once more it disappeared as if it had never been and so it served us night after night till no one heeded it but to wonder at it mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might be disappearing again for one whole day or two days or three and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on nor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordance with the preternaturalness as it seemed which in many things invested the pequod were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried at however remote times or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes that unnearable spout was cast by one self-same whale and that whale moby dick for a time there reigned too a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on in order that the monster might turn round upon us and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas these temporary apprehensions so vague but so awful derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather in which beneath all its blue blandness some thought there lurked a devilish charm as for days and days we voyaged along through seas so wearily lonesomely mild that all space in repugnance to our vengeful errand seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow but at last when turning to the eastward the cape winds began howling around us and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seas that are there when the ivory-tusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast and gored the dark waves in her madness till like showers of silver chips the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks then all this desolate vacuity of life went away but gave place to sights more dismal than before close to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens and every morning perched on our stays rows of these birds were seen and spite of our hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp as though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing appointed to desolation and therefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves and heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved the black sea as if its vast tides were a conscience and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred cape of good hope do they call ye rather cape tormentoto as called of yore for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store or beat that black air without any horizon but calm snow-white and unvarying still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky still beckoning us on from before the solitary jet would at times be descried during all this blackness of the elements ahab though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than ever addressed his mates in tempestuous times like these after everything above and aloft has been secured nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale then captain and crew become practical fatalists so with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together meantime the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the better to guard against the leaping waves each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail in which he swung as in a loosened belt few or no words were spoken and the silent ship as if manned by painted sailors in wax day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves by night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed still in silence the men swung in the bowlines still wordless ahab stood up to the blast even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock never could starbuck forget the old man's aspect when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat on the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand though the body was erect the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling the cabin-compass is called the tell-tale because without going to the compass at the helm the captain while below can inform himself of the course of the ship terrible old man thought starbuck with a shudder sleeping in this gale still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose chapter 52 the albatross south-eastward from the cape off the distant crozetts a good cruising ground for right whalemen a sail loomed ahead the goney albatross by name as she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries -- a whaler at sea and long absent from home as if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus all down her sides this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost only her lower sails were set a wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads they seemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea and though when the ship slowly glided close under our stern we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other yet those forlorn-looking fishermen mildly eyeing us as they passed said not one word to our own look-outs while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below ship ahoy have ye seen the white whale but as the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwarks was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehow fell from his hand into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain strove to make himself heard without it meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between while in various silent ways the seamen of the pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the white whale's name to another ship ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade but taking advantage of his windward position he again seized his trumpet and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer and shortly bound home he loudly hailed -- ahoy there this is the pequod bound round the world tell them to address all future letters to the pacific ocean and this time three years if i am not at home tell them to address them to -- at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed and instantly then in accordance with their singular ways shoals of small harmless fish that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side darted away with what seemed shuddering fins and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger's flanks though in the course of his continual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings swim away from me do ye murmured ahab gazing over into the water there seemed but little in the words but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced but turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old lion voice -- up helm keep her off round the world round the world there is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started where those that we left behind secure were all the time before us were this world an endless plain and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances and discover sights more sweet and strange than any cyclades or islands of king solomon then there were promise in the voyage but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swims before all human hearts while chasing such over this round globe they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed chapter 53 the gam the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms but even had this not been the case he would not after all perhaps have boarded her -- judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions -- if so it had been that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put for as it eventually turned out he cared not to consort even for five minutes with any stranger captain except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought but all this might remain inadequately estimated were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas and especially on a common cruising-ground if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york state or the equally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds these twain for the life of them cannot well avoid a mutual salutation and stopping for a moment to interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for a while and resting in concert then how much more natural that upon the illimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth -- off lone fanning's island or the far away king's mills how much more natural i say that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails but come into still closer more friendly and sociable contact and especially would this seem to be a matter of course in the case of vessels owned in one seaport and whose captains officers and not a few of the men are personally known to each other and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about for the long absent ship the outward-bounder perhaps has letters on board at any rate she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files and in return for that courtesy the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be destined a thing of the utmost importance to her and in degree all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other's track on the cruising-ground itself even though they are equally long absent from home for one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third and now far remote vessel and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets besides they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable chat for not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils nor would difference of country make any very essential difference that is so long as both parties speak one language as is the case with americans and english though to be sure from the small number of english whalers such meetings do not very often occur and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them for your englishman is rather reserved and your yankee he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself besides the english whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american whalers regarding the long lean nantucketer with his nondescript provincialisms as a sort of sea-peasant but where this superiority in the english whalemen does really consist it would be hard to say seeing that the yankees in one day collectively kill more whales than all the english collectively in ten years but this is a harmless little foible in the english whale-hunters which the nantucketer does not take much to heart probably because he knows that he has a few foibles himself so then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea the whalers have most reason to be sociable -- and they are so whereas some merchant ships crossing each other's wake in the mid-atlantic will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition mutually cutting each other on the high seas like a brace of dandies in broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism upon each other's rig as for men-of-war when they chance to meet at sea they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings such a ducking of ensigns that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all as touching slave-ships meeting why they are in such a prodigious hurry they run away from each other as soon as possible and as for pirates when they chance to cross each other's cross-bones the first hail is -- how many skulls -- the same way that whalers hail -- how many barrels and that question once answered pirates straightway steer apart for they are infernal villains on both sides and don't like to see overmuch of each other's villanous likenesses but look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable free-and-easy whaler what does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather she has a gam a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at it and repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubber-boilers and such like pretty exclamations why it is that all merchant-seamen and also all pirates and man-of-war's men and slave-ship sailors cherish such a scornful feeling towards whale-ships this is a question it would be hard to answer because in the case of pirates say i should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the gallows and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude hence i conclude that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on but what is a gam you might wear out your index-finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word dr johnson never attained to that erudition noah webster's ark does not hold it nevertheless this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees certainly it needs a definition and should be incorporated into the lexicon with that view let me learnedly define it gam noun -- a social meeting of two or more whaleships generally on a cruising-ground when after exchanging hails they exchange visits by boats' crews the two captains remaining for the time on board of one ship and the two chief mates on the other there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten here all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail so has the whale fishery in a pirate man-of-war or slave ship when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner's tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons but the whale-boat has no seat astern no sofa of that sort whatever and no tiller at all high times indeed if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs and as for a tiller the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree and often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs nor is this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front he is thus completely wedged before and behind and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs but a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth merely make a spread angle of two poles and you cannot stand them up then again it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes it would never do i say for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands indeed as token of his entire buoyant self-command he generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets but perhaps being generally very large heavy hands he carries them there for ballast nevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated ones too where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall say -- to seize hold of the nearest oarsman's hair and hold on there like grim death chapter 54 the town-ho's story as told at the golden inn the cape of good hope and all the watery region round about there is much like some noted four corners of a great highway where you meet more travellers than in any other part it was not very long after speaking the goney that another homeward-bound whaleman the town-ho was encountered she was manned almost wholly by polynesians in the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the white whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the town-ho's story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of god which at times are said to overtake some men this latter circumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ears of captain ahab or his mates for that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the town-ho himself it was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship one of whom it seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of secrecy but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it in that way that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the full knowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so were they governed in this matter that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequod's main-mast interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship the whole of this strange affair i now proceed to put on lasting record the ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin for my humor's sake i shall preserve the style in which i once narrated it at lima to a lounging circle of my spanish friends one saint's eve smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the golden inn of those fine cavaliers the young dons pedro and sebastian were on the closer terms with me and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put and which are duly answered at the time some two years prior to my first learning the events which i am about rehearsing to you gentlemen the town-ho sperm whaler of nantucket was cruising in your pacific here not very many days' sail eastward from the eaves of this good golden inn she was somewhere to the northward of the line one morning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common they supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her gentlemen but the captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes and therefore being very averse to quit them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued her cruisings the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals but no good luck came more days went by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much so that now taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands there to have his hull hove out and repaired though no small passage was before her yet if the commonest chance favoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way because his pumps were of the best and being periodically relieved at them those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free never mind if the leak should double on her in truth well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes the town-ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado from buffalo 'lakeman -- buffalo pray what is a lakeman and where is buffalo ' said don sebastian rising in his swinging mat of grass on the eastern shore of our lake erie don but -- i crave your courtesy -- may be you shall soon hear further of all that now gentlemen in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships well-nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla this lakeman in the land-locked heart of our america had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean for in their interflowing aggregate those grand fresh-water seas of ours -- erie and ontario and huron and superior and michigan -- possess an ocean-like expansiveness with many of the ocean's noblest traits with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes they contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles even as the polynesian waters do in large part are shored by two great contrasting nations as the atlantic is they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east dotted all round their banks here and there are frowned upon by batteries and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty mackinaw they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories at intervals they yield their beaches to wild barbarians whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in gothic genealogies those same woods harboring wild afric beasts of prey and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to tartar emperors they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo and cleveland as well as winnebago villages they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state the steamer and the beech canoe they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave they know what shipwrecks are for out of sight of land however inland they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew thus gentlemen though an inlander steelkilt was wild-ocean born and wild-ocean nurtured as much of an audacious mariner as any and for radney though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach to nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives yet was this nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits and this lakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexible firmness only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave's right thus treated this steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile at all events he had proved so thus far but radney was doomed and made mad and steelkilt -- but gentlemen you shall hear it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven that the town-ho's leak seemed again increasing but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic for example some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it though of a still sleepy night should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward gentlemen is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters some really landless latitude that her captain begins to feel a little anxious much this way had it been with the town-ho so when her leak was found gaining once more there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way expanded to the breeze now this radney i suppose was as little of a coward and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine gentlemen therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her so when they were working that evening at the pumps there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water clear as any mountain spring gentlemen -- that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes now as you well know it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours -- watery or otherwise that when a person placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern's tower and make a little heap of dust of it be this conceit of mine as it may gentlemen at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a roman and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy's snorting charger and a brain and a heart and a soul in him gentlemen which had made steelkilt charlemagne had he been born son to charlemagne's father but radney the mate was ugly as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn as malicious he did not love steelkilt and steelkilt knew it espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest the lakeman affected not to notice him but unawed went on with his gay banterings 'aye aye my merry lads it's a lively leak this hold a cannikin one of ye and let's have a taste by the lord it's worth bottling i tell ye what men old rad's investment must go for it he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home the fact is boys that sword-fish only began the job he's come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters saw-fish and file-fish and what not and the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making improvements i suppose if old rad were here now i'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em they're playing the devil with his estate i can tell him but he's a simple old soul -- rad and a beauty too boys they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses i wonder if he'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose ' 'damn your eyes what's that pump stopping for ' roared radney pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk 'thunder away at it ' 'aye aye sir ' said steelkilt merry as a cricket 'lively boys lively now ' and with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines the men tossed their hats off to it and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life's utmost energies quitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the lakeman went forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his face fiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow now what cozening fiend it was gentlemen that possessed radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state i know not but so it happened intolerably striding along the deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and also a shovel and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large now gentlemen sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time such gentlemen is the inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces but in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys if boys there be aboard besides it was the stronger men in the town-ho that had been divided into gangs taking turns at the pumps and being the most athletic seaman of them all steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties such being the case with his comrades i mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men but there was more than this the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt as though radney had spat in his face any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command but as he sat still for a moment and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them as he instinctively saw all this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being -- a repugnance most felt when felt at all by really valiant men even when aggrieved -- this nameless phantom feeling gentlemen stole over steelkilt therefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business and he would not do it and then without at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had done little or nothing all day to this radney replied with an oath in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with an uplifted cooper's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensed radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face furiously commanding him to do his bidding steelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated his intention not to obey seeing however that his forbearance had not the slightest effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but it was to no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor the lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer 'mr radney i will not obey you take that hammer away or look to yourself ' but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where the lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions retreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would murder him but gentlemen the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads they were both canallers 'canallers ' cried don pedro 'we have seen many whale-ships in our harbours but never heard of your canallers pardon who and what are they ' 'canallers don are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal you must have heard of it ' 'nay senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary land we know but little of your vigorous north ' 'aye well then don refill my cup your chicha's very fine and ere proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are for such information may throw side-light upon my story ' for three hundred and sixty miles gentlemen through the entire breadth of the state of new york through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages through long dismal uninhabited swamps and affluent cultivated fields unrivalled for fertility by billiard-room and bar-room through the holy-of-holies of great forests on roman arches over indian rivers through sun and shade by happy hearts or broken through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk counties and especially by rows of snow-white chapels whose spires stand almost like milestones flows one continual stream of venetianly corrupt and often lawless life there's your true ashantee gentlemen there howl your pagans where you ever find them next door to you under the long-flung shadow and the snug patronising lee of churches for by some curious fatality as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice so sinners gentlemen most abound in holiest vicinities 'is that a friar passing ' said don pedro looking downwards into the crowded plazza with humorous concern 'well for our northern friend dame isabella's inquisition wanes in lima ' laughed don sebastian 'proceed senor ' 'a moment pardon ' cried another of the company 'in the name of all us limeese i but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima for distant venice in your corrupt comparison oh do not bow and look surprised you know the proverb all along this coast -- corrupt as lima it but bears out your saying too churches more plentiful than billiard-tables and for ever open -- and corrupt as lima so too venice i have been there the holy city of the blessed evangelist st mark -- st dominic purge it your cup thanks here i refill now you pour out again ' freely depicted in his own vocation gentlemen the canaller would make a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he like mark antony for days and days along his green-turfed flowery nile he indolently floats openly toying with his red-cheeked cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore all this effeminacy is dashed the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly sports his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities once a vagabond on his own canal i have received good turns from one of these canallers i thank him heartily would fain be not ungrateful but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one in sum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling captains nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a christian corn-field and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas 'i see i see ' impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles 'no need to travel the world's one lima i had thought now that at your temperate north the generations were cold and holy as the hills -- but the story ' i left off gentlemen where the lakeman shook the backstay hardly had he done so when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers who all crowded him to the deck but sliding down the ropes like baleful comets the two canallers rushed into the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out of harm's way the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarter-deck at intervals he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion and prying into the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the object of his resentment but steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass these sea-parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade 'come out of that ye pirates ' roared the captain now menacing them with a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the steward 'come out of that ye cut-throats ' steelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there defied the worst the pistols could do but gave the captain to understand distinctly that his steelkilt's death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty 'will you promise not to touch us if we do ' demanded their ringleader 'turn to turn to -- i make no promise -- to your duty do you want to sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this turn to ' and he once more raised a pistol 'sink the ship ' cried steelkilt 'aye let her sink not a man of us turns to unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us what say ye men ' turning to his comrades a fierce cheer was their response the lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eye on the captain and jerking out such sentences as these -- 'it's not our fault we didn't want it i told him to take his hammer away it was boy's business he might have known me before this i told him not to prick the buffalo i believe i have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ain't those mincing knives down in the forecastle there men look to those handspikes my hearties captain by god look to yourself say the word don't be a fool forget it all we are ready to turn to treat us decently and we're your men but we won't be flogged ' 'turn to i make no promises turn to i say ' 'look ye now ' cried the lakeman flinging out his arm towards him 'there are a few of us here and i am one of them who have shipped for the cruise d'ye see now as you well know sir we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down so we don't want a row it's not our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work but we won't be flogged ' 'turn to ' roared the captain steelkilt glanced round him a moment and then said -- 'i tell you what it is now captain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shabby rascal we won't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us but till you say the word about not flogging us we don't do a hand's turn ' 'down into the forecastle then down with ye i'll keep ye there till ye're sick of it down ye go ' 'shall we ' cried the ringleader to his men most of them were against it but at length in obedience to steelkilt they preceded him down into their dark den growlingly disappearing like bears into a cave as the lakeman's bare head was just level with the planks the captain and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway then opening the slide a little the captain whispered something down the crack closed it and turned the key upon them -- ten in number -- leaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far had remained neutral all night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers forward and aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge after breaking through the bulkhead below but the hours of darkness passed in peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship at sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the deck summoned the prisoners to work but with a yell they refused water was then lowered down to them and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it the captain returned to the quarter-deck twice every day for three days this was repeated but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was delivered and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were ready to turn to the fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution had constrained them to surrender at discretion emboldened by this the captain reiterated his demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged on the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them only three were left 'better turn to now ' said the captain with a heartless jeer 'shut us up again will ye ' cried steelkilt 'oh certainly ' the captain and the key clicked it was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair it was then that steelkilt proposed to the two canallers thus far apparently of one mind with him to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison and armed with their keen mincing knives long crescentic heavy implements with a handle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for himself he would do this he said whether they joined him or not that was the last night he should spend in that den but the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two they swore they were ready for that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender and what was more they each insisted upon being the first man on deck when the time to make the rush should come but to this their leader as fiercely objected reserving that priority for himself particularly as his two comrades would not yield the one to the other in the matter and both of them could not be first for the ladder would but admit one man at a time and here gentlemen the foul play of these miscreants must come out upon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same piece of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last they in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed their before secret treacheries together and when their leader fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences and bound the sleeper with cords and gagged him with cords and shrieked out for the captain at midnight thinking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle in a few minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder but all these were collared and dragged along the deck like dead cattle and side by side were seized up into the mizzen rigging like three quarters of meat and there they hung till morning 'damn ye ' cried the captain pacing to and fro before them 'the vultures would not touch ye ye villains ' at sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round -- thought upon the whole he would do so -- he ought to -- justice demanded it but for the present considering their timely surrender he would let them go with a reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular 'but as for you ye carrion rogues ' turning to the three men in the rigging -- 'for you i mean to mince ye up for the try-pots ' and seizing a rope he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors till they yelled no more but lifelessly hung their heads sideways as the two crucified thieves are drawn 'my wrist is sprained with ye ' he cried at last 'but there is still rope enough left for you my fine bantam that wouldn't give up take that gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can say for himself ' for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head said in a sort of hiss 'what i say is this -- and mind it well -- if you flog me i murder you ' 'say ye so then see how ye frighten me' -- and the captain drew off with the rope to strike 'best not ' hissed the lakeman 'but i must ' -- and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke steelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captain who to the amazement of all hands started back paced the deck rapidly two or three times and then suddenly throwing down his rope said 'i won't do it -- let him go -- cut him down d'ye hear ' but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order a pale man with a bandaged head arrested them -- radney the chief mate ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing the tumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole scene such was the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe 'you are a coward ' hissed the lakeman 'so i am but take that ' the mate was in the very act of striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausing no more made good his word spite of steelkilt's threat whatever that might have been the three men were then cut down all hands were turned to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen the iron pumps clanged as before just after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamor was heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitors running up besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crew entreaties cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own instance they were put down in the ship's run for salvation still no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest on the contrary it seemed that mainly at steelkilt's instigation they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness obey all orders to the last and when the ship reached port desert her in a body but in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thing -- namely not to sing out for whales in case any should be discovered for spite of her leak and spite of all her other perils the town-ho still maintained her mast-heads and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least till all was over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart he was in radney the chief mate's watch and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rigging he insisted against the express counsel of the captain upon resuming the head of his watch at night upon this and one or two other circumstances steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge during the night radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there a little above the ship's side in this attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed there was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between this was the sea steelkilt calculated his time and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed at his leisure he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below 'what are you making there ' said a shipmate 'what do you think what does it look like ' 'like a lanyard for your bag but it's an odd one seems to me ' 'yes rather oddish ' said the lakeman holding it at arm's length before him 'but i think it will answer shipmate i haven't enough twine -- have you any ' but there was none in the forecastle 'then i must get some from old rad ' and he rose to go aft 'you don't mean to go a begging to him ' said a sailor 'why not do you think he won't do me a turn when it's to help himself in the end shipmate ' and going to the mate he looked at him quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock it was given him -- neither twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night an iron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of the lakeman's monkey jacket as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow twenty-four hours after his trick at the silent helm -- nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman's hand -- that fatal hour was then to come and in the fore-ordaining soul of steelkilt the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed in but gentlemen a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned yet complete revenge he had and without being the avenger for by a mysterious fatality heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day when they were washing down the decks that a stupid teneriffe man drawing water in the main-chains all at once shouted out 'there she rolls there she rolls ' jesu what a whale it was moby dick 'moby dick ' cried don sebastian 'st dominic sir sailor but do whales have christenings whom call you moby dick ' 'a very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster don -- but that would be too long a story ' 'how how ' cried all the young spaniards crowding 'nay dons dons -- nay nay i cannot rehearse that now let me get more into the air sirs ' 'the chicha the chicha ' cried don pedro 'our vigorous friend looks faint -- fill up his empty glass ' no need gentlemen one moment and i proceed -- now gentlemen so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship -- forgetful of the compact among the crew -- in the excitement of the moment the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads all was now a phrensy 'the white whale -- the white whale ' was the cry from captain mates and harpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumours were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyed askance and with curses the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea gentlemen a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted the mutineer was the bowsman of the mate and when fast to a fish it was his duty to sit next him while radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slacken the line at the word of command moreover when the four boats were lowered the mate's got the start and none howled more fiercely with delight than did steelkilt as he strained at his oar after a stiff pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand radney sprang to the bow he was always a furious man it seems in a boat and now his bandaged cry was to beach him on the whale's topmost back nothing loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out the standing mate that instant as he fell on the whale's slippery back the boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while radney was tossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale he struck out through the spray and for an instant was dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick but the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and rearing high up with him plunged headlong again and went down meantime at the first tap of the boat's bottom the lakeman had slackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly looking on he thought his own thoughts but a sudden terrific downward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line he cut it and the whale was free but at some distance moby dick rose again with some tatters of radney's red woollen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed him all four boats gave chase again but the whale eluded them and finally wholly disappeared in good time the town-ho reached her port -- a savage solitary place -- where no civilized creature resided there headed by the lakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor the ship's company being reduced to but a handful the captain called upon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak but to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both by night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent that upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel after taking counsel with his officers he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows stacked his muskets on the poop and warning the islanders not to approach the ship at their peril took one man with him and setting the sail of his best whale-boat steered straight before the wind for tahiti five hundred miles distant to procure a reinforcement to his crew on the fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals he steered away from it but the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water the captain presented a pistol with one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubbles and foam 'what do you want of me ' cried the captain 'where are you bound and for what are you bound ' demanded steelkilt 'no lies ' 'i am bound to tahiti for more men ' 'very good let me board you a moment -- i come in peace ' with that he leaped from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwale stood face to face with the captain 'cross your arms sir throw back your head now repeat after me as soon as steelkilt leaves me i swear to beach this boat on yonder island and remain there six days if i do not may lightning strike me ' 'a pretty scholar ' laughed the lakeman 'adios senor ' and leaping into the sea he swam back to his comrades watching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees steelkilt made sail again and in due time arrived at tahiti his own place of destination there luck befriended him two ships were about to sail for france and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed they embarked and so for ever got the start of their former captain had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution some ten days after the french ships sailed the whale-boat arrived and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a small native schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all right there again resumed his cruisings where steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the island of nantucket the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him 'are you through ' said don sebastian quietly 'i am don ' 'then i entreat you tell me if to the best of your own convictions this your story is in substance really true it is so passing wonderful did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with me if i seem to press ' 'also bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in don sebastian's suit ' cried the company with exceeding interest 'is there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inn gentlemen ' 'nay ' said don sebastian 'but i know a worthy priest near by who will quickly procure one for me i go for it but are you well advised this may grow too serious ' 'will you be so good as to bring the priest also don ' 'though there are no auto-da-fe's in lima now ' said one of the company to another 'i fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy let us withdraw more out of the moonlight i see no need of this ' 'excuse me for running after you don sebastian but may i also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized evangelists you can ' 'this is the priest he brings you the evangelists ' said don sebastian gravely returning with a tall and solemn figure 'let me remove my hat now venerable priest further into the light and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it 'so help me heaven and on my honour the story i have told ye gentlemen is in substance and its great items true i know it to be true it happened on this ball i trod the ship i knew the crew i have seen and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney ' chapter 55 of the monstrous pictures of whales i shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there it may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman it is time to set the world right in this matter by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculptures for ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples the pedestals of statues and on shields medallions cups and coins the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain-armor like saladin's and a helmeted head like st george's ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed not only in most popular pictures of the whale but in many scientific presentations of him now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale's is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of elephanta in india the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda all the trades and pursuits every conceivable avocation of man were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being no wonder then that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth the hindoo whale referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly known as the matse avatar but though this sculpture is half man and half whale so as only to give the tail of the latter yet that small section of him is all wrong it looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the broad palms of the true whale's majestic flukes but go to the old galleries and look now at a great christian painter's portrait of this fish for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian hindoo it is guido's picture of perseus rescuing andromeda from the sea-monster or whale where did guido get the model of such a strange creature as that nor does hogarth in painting the same scene in his own perseus descending make out one whit better the huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the surface scarcely drawing one inch of water it has a sort of howdah on its back and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling might be taken for the traitors' gate leading from the thames by water into the tower then there are the prodromus whales of old scotch sibbald and jonah's whale as depicted in the prints of old bibles and the cuts of old primers what shall be said of these as for the book-binder's whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor -- as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and new -- that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature imitated i take it from the like figures on antique vases though universally denominated a dolphin i nevertheless call this book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale because it was so intended when the device was first introduced it was introduced by an old italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century during the revival of learning and in those days and even down to a comparatively late period dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the leviathan in the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale where all manner of spouts jets d'eau hot springs and cold saratoga and baden-baden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain in the title-page of the original edition of the advancement of learning you will find some curious whales but quitting all these unprofessional attempts let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober scientific delineations by those who know in old harris's collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages a d 1671 entitled a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the whale peter peterson of friesland master in one of those plates the whales like great rafts of logs are represented lying among ice-isles with white bears running over their living backs in another plate the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes then again there is an imposing quarto written by one captain colnett a post captain in the english navy entitled a voyage round cape horn into the south seas for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale fisheries in this book is an outline purporting to be a picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of mexico august 1793 and hoisted on deck i doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines to mention but one thing about it let me say that it has an eye which applied according to the accompanying scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long ah my gallant captain why did ye not give us jonah looking out of that eye nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for the benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of mistake look at that popular work goldsmith's animated nature in the abridged london edition of 1807 there are plates of an alleged whale and a narwhale i do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow and as for the narwhale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys then again in 1825 bernard germain count de lacepede a great naturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are several pictures of the different species of the leviathan all these are not only incorrect but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland whale that is to say the right whale even scoresby a long experienced man as touching that species declares not to have its counterpart in nature but the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier brother to the famous baron in 1836 he published a natural history of whales in which he gives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale before showing that picture to any nantucketer you had best provide for your summary retreat from nantucket in a word frederick cuvier's sperm whale is not a sperm whale but a squash of course he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence he derived that picture who can tell perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field desmarest got one of his authentic abortions that is from a chinese drawing and what sort of lively lads with the pencil those chinese are many queer cups and saucers inform us as for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil-dealers what shall be said of them they are generally richard iii whales with dromedary humps and very savage breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats full of mariners their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint but these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all consider most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars though elephants have stood for their full-lengths the living leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait the living whale in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight like a launched line-of-battle ship and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations and not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full-grown platonian leviathan yet even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck such is then the outlandish eel-like limbered varying shape of him that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch but it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form not at all for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape though jeremy bentham's skeleton which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman with all jeremy's other leading personal characteristics yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones in fact as the great hunter says the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown it is also very curiously displayed in the side fin the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand minus only the thumb this fin has four regular bone-fingers the index middle ring and little finger but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering as the human fingers in an artificial covering however recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us said humorous stubb one day he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens for all these reasons then any way you may look at it you must needs conclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last true one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness so there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like and the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is by going a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him wherefore it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan chapter 56 of the less erroneous pictures of whales and the true pictures of whaling scenes in connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales i am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books both ancient and modern especially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier etc but i pass that matter by i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale colnett's huggins's frederick cuvier's and beale's in the previous chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to huggins's is far better than theirs but by great odds beale's is the best all beale's drawings of this whale are good excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes capping his second chapter his frontispiece boats attacking sperm whales though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect some of the sperm whale drawings in j ross browne are pretty correct in contour but they are wretchedly engraved that is not his fault though of the right whale the best outline pictures are in scoresby but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression he has but one picture of whaling scenes and this is a sad deficiency because it is by such pictures only when at all well done that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters but taken for all in all by far the finest though in some details not the most correct presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found are two large french engravings well executed and taken from paintings by one garnery respectively they represent attacks on the sperm and right whale in the first engraving a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks the prow of the boat is partially unbroken and is drawn just balancing upon the monster's spine and standing in that prow for that one single incomputable flash of time you behold an oarsman half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale and in the act of leaping as if from a precipice the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true the half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me i could not draw so good a one in the second engraving the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right whale that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the patagonian cliffs his jets are erect full and black like soot so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs shell-fish and other sea candies and maccaroni which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back and all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer thus the foreground is all raging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast is the glassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole who garnery the painter is or was i know not but my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman the french are the lads for painting action go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas as in that triumphal hall at versailles where the beholder fights his way pell-mell through the consecutive great battles of france where every sword seems a flash of the northern lights and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by like a charge of crowned centaurs not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery are these sea battle-pieces of garnery the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes with not one tenth of england's experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the americans they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt for the most part the english and american whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things such as the vacant profile of the whale which so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid even scoresby the justly renowned right whaleman after giving us a stiff full length of the greenland whale and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks chopping knives and grapnels and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified arctic snow crystals i mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager i honour him for a veteran but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice of the peace in addition to those fine engravings from garnery there are two other french engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribes himself h durand one of them though not precisely adapted to our present purpose nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts it is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the pacific a french whaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the background both drooping together in the breezeless air the effect is very fine when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose the other engraving is quite a different affair the ship hove-to upon the open sea and in the very heart of the leviathanic life with a right whale alongside the vessel in the act of cutting-in hove over to the monster as if to a quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is about giving chase to whales in the distance the harpoons and lances lie levelled for use three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft stands half-erect out of the water like a rearing horse from the ship the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies and to windward a black cloud rising up with earnest of squalls and rains seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen chapter 57 of whales in paint in teeth in wood in sheet-iron in stone in mountains in stars on tower-hill as you go down to the london docks you may have seen a crippled beggar or kedger as the sailors say holding a painted board before him representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg there are three whales and three boats and one of the boats presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale any time these ten years they tell me has that man held up that picture and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world but the time of his justification has now come his three whales are as good whales as were ever published in wapping at any rate and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings but though for ever mounted on that stump never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make but with downcast eyes stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation throughout the pacific and also in nantucket and new bedford and sag harbor you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes graven by the fishermen themselves on sperm whale-teeth or ladies' busks wrought out of the right whale-bone and other like skrimshander articles as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material in their hours of ocean leisure some of them have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements specially intended for the skrimshandering business but in general they toil with their jack-knives alone and with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor they will turn you out anything you please in the way of a mariner's fancy long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which god placed him i e what is called savagery your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an iroquois i myself am a savage owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals and ready at any moment to rebel against him now one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours is his wonderful patience of industry an ancient hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon for with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark's tooth that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved and it has cost steady years of steady application as with the hawaiian savage so with the white sailor-savage with the same marvellous patience and with the same single shark's tooth of his one poor jack-knife he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture not quite as workmanlike but as close packed in its maziness of design as the greek savage achilles's shield and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness as the prints of that fine old dutch savage albert durer wooden whales or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble south sea war-wood are frequently met with in the forecastles of american whalers some of them are done with much accuracy at some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road-side door when the porter is sleepy the anvil-headed whale would be best but these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays on the spires of some old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for weather-cocks but they are so elevated and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with hands off you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit in bony ribby regions of the earth where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the leviathan partly merged in grass which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges then again in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges but you must be a thorough whaleman to see these sights and not only that but if you wish to return to such a sight again you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point else so chance-like are such observations of the hills that your precise previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery like the soloma islands which still remain incognita though once high-ruffed mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them nor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of them as when long filled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds thus at the north have i chased leviathan round and round the pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me and beneath the effulgent antarctic skies i have boarded the argo-navis and joined the chase against the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying fish with a frigate's anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs would i could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight chapter 58 brit steering north-eastward from the crozetts we fell in with vast meadows of brit the minute yellow substance upon which the right whale largely feeds for leagues and leagues it undulated round us so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat on the second day numbers of right whales were seen who secure from the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit which adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous venetian blind in their mouths was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip as morning mowers who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads even so these monsters swam making a strange grassy cutting sound and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea that part of the sea known among whalemen as the brazil banks does not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do because of there being shallows and soundings there but because of this remarkable meadow-like appearance caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes where the right whale is often chased but it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers seen from the mast-heads especially when they paused and were stationary for a while their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else and as in the great hunting countries of india the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such taking them for bare blackened elevations of the soil even so often with him who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea and even when recognised at last their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all parts with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse indeed in other respects you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore for though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea and though taking a broad general view of the thing this may very well be yet coming to specialties where for example does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog the accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him but though to landsmen in general the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one though by vast odds the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters though but a moment's consideration will teach that however baby man may brag of his science and skill and however much in a flattering future that science and skill may augment yet for ever and for ever to the crack of doom the sea will insult and murder him and pulverize the stateliest stiffest frigate he can make nevertheless by the continual repetition of these very impressions man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it the first boat we read of floated on an ocean that with portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow that same ocean rolls now that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year yea foolish mortals noah's flood is not yet subsided two thirds of the fair world it yet covers wherein differ the sea and the land that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other preternatural terrors rested upon the hebrews when under the feet of korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever yet not a modern sun ever sets but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it but it is also a fiend to its own off-spring worse than the persian host who murdered his own guests sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships no mercy no power but its own controls it panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider the masterless ocean overruns the globe consider the subtleness of the sea how its most dreaded creatures glide under water unapparent for the most part and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks consider once more the universal cannibalism of the sea all whose creatures prey upon each other carrying on eternal war since the world began consider all this and then turn to this green gentle and most docile earth consider them both the sea and the land and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself for as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land so in the soul of man there lies one insular tahiti full of peace and joy but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life god keep thee push not off from that isle thou canst never return chapter 59 squid slowly wading through the meadows of brit the pequod still held on her way north-eastward towards the island of java a gentle air impelling her keel so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze as three mild palms on a plain and still at wide intervals in the silvery night the lonely alluring jet would be seen but one transparent blue morning when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea however unattended with any stagnant calm when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them enjoining some secrecy when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by daggoo from the main-mast-head in the distance a great white mass lazily rose and rising higher and higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamed before our prow like a snow-slide new slid from the hills thus glistening for a moment as slowly it subsided and sank then once more arose and silently gleamed it seemed not a whale and yet is this moby dick thought daggoo again the phantom went down but on re-appearing once more with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod the negro yelled out -- there there again there she breaches right ahead the white whale the white whale upon this the seamen rushed to the yard-arms as in swarming-time the bees rush to the boughs bare-headed in the sultry sun ahab stood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon ahab so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued however this was or whether his eagerness betrayed him whichever way it might have been no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering the four boats were soon on the water ahab's in advance and all swiftly pulling towards their prey soon it went down and while with oars suspended we were awaiting its reappearance lo in the same spot where it sank once more it slowly rose almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of moby dick we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind a vast pulpy mass furlongs in length and breadth of a glancing cream-colour lay floating on the water innumerable long arms radiating from its centre and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach no perceptible face or front did it have no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct but undulated there on the billows an unearthly formless chance-like apparition of life as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk with a wild voice exclaimed -- almost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him than to have seen thee thou white ghost what was it sir said flask the great live squid which they say few whale-ships ever beheld and returned to their ports to tell of it but ahab said nothing turning his boat he sailed back to the vessel the rest as silently following whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object certain it is that a glimpse of it being so very unusual that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness so rarely is it beheld that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food for though other species of whales find their food above water and may be seen by man in the act of feeding the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what precisely that food consists at times when closely pursued he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length they fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike other species is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid the manner in which the bishop describes it as alternately rising and sinking with some other particulars he narrates in all this the two correspond but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature here spoken of it is included among the class of cuttle-fish to which indeed in certain external respects it would seem to belong but only as the anak of the tribe chapter 60 the line with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented i have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whale-line the line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp slightly vapoured with tar not impregnated with it as in the case of ordinary ropes for while tar as ordinarily used makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected but as most seamen are beginning to learn tar in general by no means adds to the rope's durability or strength however much it may give it compactness and gloss of late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines for though not so durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elastic and i will add since there is an aesthetics in all things is much more handsome and becoming to the boat than hemp hemp is a dusky dark fellow a sort of indian but manilla is as a golden-haired circassian to behold the whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness at first sight you would not think it so strong as it really is by experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons in length the common sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred fathoms towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub not like the worm-pipe of a still though but so as to form one round cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded sheaves or layers of concentric spiralizations without any hollow but the heart or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly take somebody's arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs there is some advantage in this because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat and do not strain it so much whereas the american tub nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice which will bear up a considerable distributed weight but not very much of a concentrated one when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line-tub the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales both ends of the line are exposed the lower end terminating in an eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts first in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon in these instances the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale as it were from the one boat to the other though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort second this arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smoking minute as he sometimes does he would not stop there for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again before lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there is again carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man's oar so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing and also passing between the men as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill prevents it from slipping out from the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows and is then passed inside the boat again and some ten or twenty fathoms called box-line being coiled upon the box in the bows it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft and is then attached to the short-warp -- the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon but previous to that connexion the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction all the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions so that to the timid eye of the landsman they seem as indian jugglers with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs nor can any son of mortal woman for the first time seat himself amid those hempen intricacies and while straining his utmost at the oar bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly yet habit -- strange thing what cannot habit accomplish -- gayer sallies more merry mirth better jokes and brighter repartees you never heard over your mahogany than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat when thus hung in hangman's nooses and like the six burghers of calais before king edward the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death with a halter around every neck as you may say perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters -- some few of which are casually chronicled -- of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line and lost for when the line is darting out to be seated then in the boat is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in full play when every flying beam and shaft and wheel is grazing you it is worse for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils because the boat is rocking like a cradle and you are pitched one way and the other without the slightest warning and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action can you escape being made a mazeppa of and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out again as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itself for indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and contains it in itself as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the line as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play -- this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair but why say more all men live enveloped in whale-lines all are born with halters round their necks but it is only when caught in the swift sudden turn of death that mortals realize the silent subtle ever-present perils of life and if you be a philosopher though seated in the whale-boat you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror than though seated before your evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by your side chapter 61 stubb kills a whale if to starbuck the apparition of the squid was a thing of portents to queequeg it was quite a different object when you see him 'quid said the savage honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat then you quick see him 'parm whale the next day was exceedingly still and sultry and with nothing special to engage them the pequod's crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea for this part of the indian ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground that is it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises dolphins flying-fish and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters than those off the rio de la plata or the in-shore ground off peru it was my turn to stand at the foremast-head and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds to and fro i idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air no resolution could withstand it in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness at last my soul went out of my body though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn ere forgetfulness altogether came over me i had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy so that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman the waves too nodded their indolent crests and across the wide trance of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes like vices my hands grasped the shrouds some invisible gracious agency preserved me with a shock i came back to life and lo close under our lee not forty fathoms off a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of an ethiopian hue glistening in the sun's rays like a mirror but lazily undulating in the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon but that pipe poor whale was thy last as if struck by some enchanter's wand the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel simultaneously with the three notes from aloft shouted forth the accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air clear away the boats luff cried ahab and obeying his own order he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes the sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boats were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripples as he swam that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whispers so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of the boats we swiftly but silently paddled along the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set presently as we thus glided in chase the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up there go flukes was the cry an announcement immediately followed by stubb's producing his match and igniting his pipe for now a respite was granted after the full interval of his sounding had elapsed the whale rose again and being now in advance of the smoker's boat and much nearer to it than to any of the others stubb counted upon the honour of the capture it was obvious now that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers all silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use paddles were dropped and oars came loudly into play and still puffing at his pipe stubb cheered on his crew to the assault yes a mighty change had come over the fish all alive to his jeopardy he was going head out that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale's enormous head consists though apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyant part about him so that with ease he elevates it in the air and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed besides such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head and such the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part that by obliquely elevating his head he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed new york pilot-boat start her start her my men don't hurry yourselves take plenty of time -- but start her start her like thunder-claps that's all cried stubb spluttering out the smoke as he spoke start her now give 'em the long and strong stroke tashtego start her tash my boy -- start her all but keep cool keep cool -- cucumbers is the word -- easy easy -- only start her like grim death and grinning devils and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves boys -- that's all start her woo-hoo wa-hee screamed the gay-header in reply raising some old war-whoop to the skies as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager indian gave but his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild kee-hee kee-hee yelled daggoo straining forwards and backwards on his seat like a pacing tiger in his cage ka-la koo-loo howled queequeg as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of grenadier's steak and thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea meanwhile stubb retaining his place in the van still encouraged his men to the onset all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth like desperadoes they tugged and they strained till the welcome cry was heard -- stand up tashtego -- give it to him the harpoon was hurled stern all the oarsmen backed water the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists it was the magical line an instant before stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of its increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe as the line passed round and round the loggerhead so also just before reaching that point it blisteringly passed through and through both of stubb's hands from which the hand-cloths or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times had accidentally dropped it was like holding an enemy's sharp two-edged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch wet the line wet the line cried stubb to the tub oarsman him seated by the tub who snatching off his hat dashed sea-water into it more turns were taken so that the line began holding its place the boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins stubb and tashtego here changed places -- stem for stern -- a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion partly to show the indispensableness of this act it may here be stated that in the old dutch fishery a mop was used to dash the running line with water in many other ships a wooden piggin or bailer is set apart for that purpose your hat however is the most convenient from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat and from its now being more tight than a harpstring you would have thought the craft had two keels -- one cleaving the water the other the air -- as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once a continual cascade played at the bows a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake and at the slightest motion from within even but of a little finger the vibrating cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea thus they rushed each man with might and main clinging to his seat to prevent being tossed to the foam and the tall form of tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double in order to bring down his centre of gravity whole atlantics and pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight haul in -- haul in cried stubb to the bowsman and facing round towards the whale all hands began pulling the boat up to him while yet the boat was being towed on soon ranging up by his flank stubb firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the flying fish at the word of command the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale's horrible wallow and then ranging up for another fling the red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake the slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reflection into every face so that they all glowed to each other like red men and all the while jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon his crooked lance by the line attached to it stubb straightened it again and again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale then again and again sent it into the whale pull up -- pull up he now cried to the bowsman as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath pull up -- close to and the boat ranged along the fish's flank when reaching far over the bow stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish and kept it there carefully churning and churning as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out but that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish and now it is struck for starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry the monster horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself in impenetrable mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping astern had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day and now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into view surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout-hole with sharp cracking agonized respirations at last gush after gush of clotted red gore as if it had been the purple lees of red wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea his heart had burst he's dead mr stubb said daggoo yes both pipes smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouth stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a moment stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made chapter 62 the dart a word concerning an incident in the last chapter according to the invariable usage of the fishery the whale-boat pushes off from the ship with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary steersman and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar the one known as the harpooneer-oar now it needs a strong nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what is called a long dart the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet but however prolonged and exhausting the chase the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost indeed he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest not only by incredible rowing but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's compass while all the other muscles are strained and half started -- what that is none know but those who have tried it for one i cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time in this straining bawling state then with his back to the fish all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry -- stand up and give it to him he now has to drop and secure his oar turn round on his centre half way seize his harpoon from the crotch and with what little strength may remain he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale no wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body that out of fifty fair chances for a dart not five are successful no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels no wonder that to many ship owners whaling is but a losing concern for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant that is when the whale starts to run the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else it is then they change places and the headsman the chief officer of the little craft takes his proper station in the bows of the boat now i care not who maintains the contrary but all this is both foolish and unnecessary the headsman should stay in the bows from first to last he should both dart the harpoon and the lance and no rowing whatever should be expected of him except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them to insure the greatest efficiency in the dart the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness and not from out of toil chapter 63 the crotch out of the trunk the branches grow out of them the twigs so in productive subjects grow the chapters the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention it is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two feet in length which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly projects from the prow thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall it is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch respectively called the first and second irons but these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connected with the line the object being this to dart them both if possible one instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the coming drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold it is a doubling of the chances but it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneer however lightning-like in his movements to pitch the second iron into him nevertheless as the second iron is already connected with the line and the line is running hence that weapon must at all events be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands tumbled into the water it accordingly is in such cases the spare coils of box line mentioned in a preceding chapter making this feat in most instances prudently practicable but this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties furthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharp-edged terror skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the lines or cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all directions nor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse consider now how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong active and knowing whale when owing to these qualities in him as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him for of course each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery all these particulars are faithfully narrated here as they will not fail to elucidate several most important however intricate passages in scenes hereafter to be painted chapter 64 stubb's supper stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship it was a calm so forming a tandem of three boats we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the pequod and now as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the sea and it seemed hardly to budge at all except at long intervals good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved for upon the great canal of hang-ho or whatever they call it in china four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along as if laden with pig-lead in bulk darkness came on but three lights up and down in the pequod's main-rigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we saw ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his way into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning though in overseeing the pursuit of this whale captain ahab had evinced his customary activity to call it so yet now that the creature was dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair seemed working in him as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that moby dick was yet to be slain and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship all that would not one jot advance his grand monomaniac object very soon you would have thought from the sound on the pequod's decks that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck and thrust rattling out of the port-holes but by those clanking links the vast corpse itself not the ship is to be moored tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel's and seen through the darkness of the night which obscured the spars and rigging aloft the two -- ship and whale seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks whereof one reclines while the other remains standing a little item may as well be related here the strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside is by the flukes or tail and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other excepting the side-fins its flexibility even in death causes it to sink low beneath the surface so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order to put the chain round it but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome a small strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end and a weight in its middle while the other end is secured to the ship by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chain is readily made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes if moody ahab was now all quiescence at least so far as could be known on deck stubb his second mate flushed with conquest betrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid starbuck his official superior quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs one small helping cause of all this liveliness in stubb was soon made strangely manifest stubb was a high liver he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate a steak a steak ere i sleep you daggoo overboard you go and cut me one from his small here be it known that though these wild fishermen do not as a general thing and according to the great military maxim make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale designated by stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body about midnight that steak was cut and cooked and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan-head as if that capstan were a sideboard nor was stubb the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night mingling their mumblings with his own mastications thousands on thousands of sharks swarming round the dead leviathan smackingly feasted on its fatness the few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull within a few inches of the sleepers' hearts peering over the side you could just see them as before you heard them wallowing in the sullen black waters and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head this particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailable surface they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remains a part of the universal problem of all things the mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other's live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled the sharks also with their jewel-hilted mouths are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the whole affair upside down it would still be pretty much the same thing that is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the atlantic systematically trotting alongside to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a dead slave to be decently buried and though one or two other like instances might be set down touching the set terms places and occasions when sharks do most socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers and in gayer or more jovial spirits than around a dead sperm whale moored by night to a whaleship at sea if you have never seen that sight then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil-worship and the expediency of conciliating the devil but as yet stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips cook cook -- where's that old fleece he cried at length widening his legs still further as if to form a more secure base for his supper and at the same time darting his fork into the dish as if stabbing with his lance cook you cook -- sail this way cook the old black not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour came shambling along from his galley for like many old blacks there was something the matter with his knee-pans which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans this old fleece as they called him came shuffling and limping along assisting his step with his tongs which after a clumsy fashion were made of straightened iron hoops this old ebony floundered along and in obedience to the word of command came to a dead stop on the opposite side of stubb's sideboard when with both hands folded before him and resting on his two-legged cane he bowed his arched back still further over at the same time sideways inclining his head so as to bring his best ear into play cook said stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth don't you think this steak is rather overdone you've been beating this steak too much cook it's too tender don't i always say that to be good a whale-steak must be tough there are those sharks now over the side don't you see they prefer it tough and rare what a shindy they are kicking up cook go and talk to 'em tell 'em they are welcome to help themselves civilly and in moderation but they must keep quiet blast me if i can hear my own voice away cook and deliver my message here take this lantern snatching one from his sideboard now then go and preach to 'em sullenly taking the offered lantern old fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks and then with one hand dropping his light low over the sea so as to get a good view of his congregation with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks while stubb softly crawling behind overheard all that was said fellow-critters i'se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare you hear stop dat dam smackin' ob de lips massa stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings but by gor you must stop dat dam racket cook here interposed stubb accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shoulder -- cook why damn your eyes you mustn't swear that way when you're preaching that's no way to convert sinners cook who dat den preach to him yourself sullenly turning to go no cook go on go on well den belubed fellow-critters - right exclaimed stubb approvingly coax 'em to it try that and fleece continued do you is all sharks and by natur wery woracious yet i zay to you fellow-critters dat dat woraciousness -- 'top dat dam slappin' ob de tail how you tink to hear spose you keep up such a dam slappin' and bitin' dare cook cried stubb collaring him i won't have that swearing talk to 'em gentlemanly once more the sermon proceeded your woraciousness fellow-critters i don't blame ye so much for dat is natur and can't be helped but to gobern dat wicked natur dat is de pint you is sharks sartin but if you gobern de shark in you why den you be angel for all angel is not'ing more dan de shark well goberned now look here bred'ren just try wonst to be cibil a helping yourselbs from dat whale don't be tearin' de blubber out your neighbour's mout i say is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale and by gor none on you has de right to dat whale dat whale belong to some one else i know some o' you has berry brig mout brigger dan oders but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks dat can't get into de scrouge to help demselves well done old fleece cried stubb that's christianity go on no use goin' on de dam willains will keep a scougin' and slappin' each oder massa stubb dey don't hear one word no use a-preaching to such dam g'uttons as you call 'em till dare bellies is full and dare bellies is bottomless and when dey do get 'em full dey wont hear you den for den dey sink in the sea go fast to sleep on de coral and can't hear noting at all no more for eber and eber upon my soul i am about of the same opinion so give the benediction fleece and i'll away to my supper upon this fleece holding both hands over the fishy mob raised his shrill voice and cried -- cussed fellow-critters kick up de damndest row as ever you can fill your dam bellies 'till dey bust -- and den die now cook said stubb resuming his supper at the capstan stand just where you stood before there over against me and pay particular attention all 'dention said fleece again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position well said stubb helping himself freely meanwhile i shall now go back to the subject of this steak in the first place how old are you cook what dat do wid de 'teak said the old black testily silence how old are you cook 'bout ninety dey say he gloomily muttered and you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years cook and don't know yet how to cook a whale-steak rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question where were you born cook 'hind de hatchway in ferry-boat goin' ober de roanoke born in a ferry-boat that's queer too but i want to know what country you were born in cook didn't i say de roanoke country he cried sharply no you didn't cook but i'll tell you what i'm coming to cook you must go home and be born over again you don't know how to cook a whale-steak yet bress my soul if i cook noder one he growled angrily turning round to depart come back here cook -- here hand me those tongs -- now take that bit of steak there and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be take it i say -- holding the tongs towards him -- take it and taste it faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment the old negro muttered best cooked 'teak i eber taste joosy berry joosy cook said stubb squaring himself once more do you belong to the church passed one once in cape-down said the old man sullenly and you have once in your life passed a holy church in cape-town where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow-creatures have you cook and yet you come here and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now eh said stubb where do you expect to go to cook go to bed berry soon he mumbled half-turning as he spoke avast heave to i mean when you die cook it's an awful question now what's your answer when dis old brack man dies said the negro slowly changing his whole air and demeanor he hisself won't go nowhere but some bressed angel will come and fetch him fetch him how in a coach and four as they fetched elijah and fetch him where up dere said fleece holding his tongs straight over his head and keeping it there very solemnly so then you expect to go up into our main-top do you cook when you are dead but don't you know the higher you climb the colder it gets main-top eh didn't say dat t'all said fleece again in the sulks you said up there didn't you and now look yourself and see where your tongs are pointing but perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber's hole cook but no no cook you don't get there except you go the regular way round by the rigging it's a ticklish business but must be done or else it's no go but none of us are in heaven yet drop your tongs cook and hear my orders do ye hear hold your hat in one hand and clap t'other a'top of your heart when i'm giving my orders cook what that your heart there -- that's your gizzard aloft aloft -- that's it -- now you have it hold it there now and pay attention all 'dention said the old black with both hands placed as desired vainly wriggling his grizzled head as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time well then cook you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad that i have put it out of sight as soon as possible you see that don't you well for the future when you cook another whale-steak for my private table here the capstan i'll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing hold the steak in one hand and show a live coal to it with the other that done dish it d'ye hear and now to-morrow cook when we are cutting in the fish be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins have them put in pickle as for the ends of the flukes have them soused cook there now ye may go but fleece had hardly got three paces off when he was recalled cook give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch d'ye hear away you sail then -- halloa stop make a bow before you go -- avast heaving again whale-balls for breakfast -- don't forget wish by gor whale eat him 'stead of him eat whale i'm bressed if he ain't more of shark dan massa shark hisself muttered the old man limping away with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock chapter 65 the whale as a dish that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp and like stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it it is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the right whale was esteemed a great delicacy in france and commanded large prices there also that in henry viiith's time a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are a species of whale porpoises indeed are to this day considered fine eating the meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls the old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them they had a great porpoise grant from the crown the fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long it takes away your appetite only the most unprejudiced of men like stubb nowadays partake of cooked whales but the esquimaux are not so fastidious we all know how they live upon whales and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil zogranda one of their most famous doctors recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing and this reminds me that certain englishmen who long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vessel -- that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber among the dutch whalemen these scraps are called fritters which indeed they greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling something like old amsterdam housewives' dough-nuts or oly-cooks when fresh they have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his exceeding richness he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be delicately good look at his hump which would be as fine eating as the buffalo's which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such a solid pyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself how bland and creamy that is like the transparent half-jellied white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance and then partaking of it in the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile many a good supper have i thus made in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a fine dish the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the two plump whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling two large puddings they are then mixed with flour and cooked into a most delectable mess in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head which is quite a dish among some epicures and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures by continually dining upon calves' brains by and by get to have a little brains of their own so as to be able to tell a calf's head from their own heads which indeed requires uncommon discrimination and that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf's head before him is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see the head looks a sort of reproachfully at him with an et tu brute expression it is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence that appears to result in some way from the consideration before mentioned i e that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea and eat it too by its own light but no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer perhaps he was hung and if he had been put on his trial by oxen he certainly would have been and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does go to the meat-market of a saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal's jaw cannibals who is not a cannibal i tell you it will be more tolerable for the fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine it will be more tolerable for that provident fejee i say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized and enlightened gourmand who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate-de-foie-gras but stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that is adding insult to injury is it look at your knife-handle there my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what is that handle made of -- what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating and what do you pick your teeth with after devouring that fat goose with a feather of the same fowl and with what quill did the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to ganders formally indite his circulars it is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronise nothing but steel pens chapter 66 the shark massacre when in the southern fishery a captured sperm whale after long and weary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as a general thing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in for that business is an exceedingly laborious one is not very soon completed and requires all hands to set about it therefore the common usage is to take in all sail lash the helm a'lee and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight with the reservation that until that time anchor-watches shall be kept that is two and two for an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well but sometimes especially upon the line in the pacific this plan will not answer at all because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase that were he left so for six hours say on a stretch little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning in most other parts of the ocean however where these fish do not so largely abound their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades a procedure notwithstanding which in some instances only seems to tickle them into still greater activity but it was not thus in the present case with the pequod's sharks though to be sure any man unaccustomed to such sights to have looked over her side that night would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese and those sharks the maggots in it nevertheless upon stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was concluded and when accordingly queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck no small excitement was created among the sharks for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side and lowering three lanterns so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea these two mariners darting their long whaling-spades kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls seemingly their only vital part but in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts the marksmen could not always hit their mark and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe they viciously snapped not only at each other's disembowelments but like flexible bows bent round and bit their own till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound nor was this all it was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones after what might be called the individual life had departed killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin one of these sharks almost took poor queequeg's hand off when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw the whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel is about the bigness of a man's spread hand and in general shape corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named only its sides are perfectly flat and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower this weapon is always kept as sharp as possible and when being used is occasionally honed just like a razor in its socket a stiff pole from twenty to thirty feet long is inserted for a handle queequeg no care what god made him shark said the savage agonizingly lifting his hand up and down wedder fejee god or nantucket god but de god wat made shark must be one dam ingin chapter 67 cutting in it was a saturday night and such a sabbath as followed ex officio professors of sabbath breaking are all whalemen the ivory pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble every sailor a butcher you would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods in the first place the enormous cutting tackles among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green and which no single man can possibly lift -- this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head the strongest point anywhere above a ship's deck the end of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies was then conducted to the windlass and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale to this block the great blubber hook weighing some one hundred pounds was attached and now suspended in stages over the side starbuck and stubb the mates armed with their long spades began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins this done a broad semicircular line is cut round the hole the hook is inserted and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass when instantly the entire ship careens over on her side every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather she trembles quivers and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky more and more she leans over to the whale while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows till at last a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it for the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the scarf simultaneously cut by the spades of starbuck and stubb the mates and just as fast as it is thus peeled off and indeed by that very act itself it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top the men at the windlass then cease heaving and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard one of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long keen weapon called a boarding-sword and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass into this hole the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber in order to prepare for what follows whereupon this accomplished swordsman warning all hands to stand off once more makes a scientific dash at the mass and with a few sidelong desperate lunging slicings severs it completely in twain so that while the short lower part is still fast the long upper strip called a blanket-piece swings clear and is all ready for lowering the heavers forward now resume their song and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other is slowly slackened away and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents and thus the work proceeds the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heavers singing the blubber-room gentlemen coiling the mates scarfing the ship straining and all hands swearing occasionally by way of assuaging the general friction chapter 68 the blanket i have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skin of the whale i have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat and learned naturalists ashore my original opinion remains unchanged but it is only an opinion the question is what and where is the skin of the whale already you know what his blubber is that blubber is something of the consistence of firm close-grained beef but tougher more elastic and compact and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness now however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature's skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale's body but that same blubber and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal if reasonably dense what can that be but the skin true from the unmarred dead body of the whale you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin transparent substance somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin that is previous to being dried when it not only contracts and thickens but becomes rather hard and brittle i have several such dried bits which i use for marks in my whale-books it is transparent as i said before and being laid upon the printed page i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence at any rate it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles as you may say but what i am driving at here is this that same infinitely thin isinglass substance which i admit invests the entire body of the whale is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature as the skin of the skin so to speak for it were simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child but no more of this assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin as in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil and when it is considered that in quantity or rather weight that oil in its expressed state is only three fourths and not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that reckoning ten barrels to the ton you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale's skin in life the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array something like those in the finest italian line engravings but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned but seem to be seen through it as if they were engraved upon the body itself nor is this all in some instances to the quick observant eye those linear marks as in a veritable engraving but afford the ground for far other delineations these are hieroglyphical that is if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion by my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular i was much struck with a plate representing the old indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the upper mississippi like those mystic rocks too the mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable this allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of another thing besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the sperm whale presents he not seldom displays the back and more especially his flanks effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratches altogether of an irregular random aspect i should say that those new england rocks on the sea-coast which agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs -- i should say that those rocks must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this particular it also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales for i have most remarked them in the large full-grown bulls of the species a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale it has already been said that it is stript from him in long pieces called blanket-pieces like most sea-terms this one is very happy and significant for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane or still better an indian poncho slipt over his head and skirting his extremity it is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers in all seas times and tides what would become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icy seas of the north if unsupplied with his cosy surtout true other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters but these be it observed are your cold-blooded lungless fish whose very bellies are refrigerators creatures that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire whereas like man the whale has lungs and warm blood freeze his blood and he dies how wonderful is it then -- except after explanation -- that this great monster to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man how wonderful that he should be found at home immersed to his lips for life in those arctic waters where when seamen fall overboard they are sometimes found months afterwards perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice as a fly is found glued in amber but more surprising is it to know as has been proved by experiment that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a borneo negro in summer it does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness oh man admire and model thyself after the whale do thou too remain warm among ice do thou too live in this world without being of it be cool at the equator keep thy blood fluid at the pole like the great dome of st peter's and like the great whale retain o man in all seasons a temperature of thine own but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things of erections how few are domed like st peter's of creatures how few vast as the whale chapter 69 the funeral haul in the chains let the carcase go astern the vast tackles have now done their duty the peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre though changed in hue it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk it is still colossal slowly it floats more and more away the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale the vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship and every rod that it so floats what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls augment the murderous din for hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair face of the pleasant sea wafted by the joyous breezes that great mass of death floats on and on till lost in infinite perspectives there's a most doleful and most mocking funeral the sea-vultures all in pious mourning the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled in life but few of them would have helped the whale i ween if peradventure he had needed it but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce oh horrible vultureism of earth from which not the mightiest whale is free nor is this the end desecrated as the body is a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun and the white spray heaving high against it straightway the whale's unharming corpse with trembling fingers is set down in the log -- shoals rocks and breakers hereabouts beware and for years afterwards perhaps ships shun the place leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held there's your law of precedents there's your utility of traditions there's the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth and now not even hovering in the air there's orthodoxy thus while in life the great whale's body may have been a real terror to his foes in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world are you a believer in ghosts my friend there are other ghosts than the cock-lane one and far deeper men than doctor johnson who believe in them chapter 70 the sphynx it should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan he was beheaded now the beheading of the sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reason consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck on the contrary where his head and body seem to join there in that very place is the thickest part of him remember also that the surgeon must operate from above some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea bear in mind too that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner without so much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdicted parts and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull do you not marvel then at stubb's boast that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale when first severed the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped that done if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of but with a full grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm whale's head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk and completely to suspend such a burden as that even by the immense tackles of a whaler this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jewellers' scales the pequod's whale being decapitated and the body stripped the head was hoisted against the ship's side -- about half way out of the sea so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element and there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head and every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves there that blood-dripping head hung to the pequod's waist like the giant holofernes's from the girdle of judith when this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamen went below to their dinner silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck an intense copper calm like a universal yellow lotus was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea a short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness came ahab alone from his cabin taking a few turns on the quarter-deck he paused to gaze over the side then slowly getting into the main-chains he took stubb's long spade -- still remaining there after the whale's decapitation -- and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended mass placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head it was a black and hooded head and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm it seemed the sphynx's in the desert speak thou vast and venerable head muttered ahab which though ungarnished with a beard yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses speak mighty head and tell us the secret thing that is in thee of all divers thou hast dived the deepest that head upon which the upper sun now gleams has moved amid this world's foundations where unrecorded names and navies rust and untold hopes and anchors rot where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned there in that awful water-land there was thy most familiar home thou hast been where bell or diver never went hast slept by many a sailor's side where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down thou saw'st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave true to each other when heaven seemed false to them thou saw'st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw and his murderers still sailed on unharmed -- while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched longing arms o head thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of abraham and not one syllable is thine sail ho cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head aye well now that's cheering cried ahab suddenly erecting himself while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow that lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man -- where away three points on the starboard bow sir and bringing down her breeze to us better and better man would now st paul would come along that way and to my breezelessness bring his breeze o nature and o soul of man how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter but has its cunning duplicate in mind chapter 71 the jeroboam's story hand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came faster than the ship and soon the pequod began to rock by and by through the glass the stranger's boats and manned mast-heads proved her a whale-ship but as she was so far to windward and shooting by apparently making a passage to some other ground the pequod could not hope to reach her so the signal was set to see what response would be made here be it said that like the vessels of military marines the ships of the american whale fleet have each a private signal all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached every captain is provided with it thereby the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean even at considerable distances and with no small facility the pequod's signal was at last responded to by the stranger's setting her own which proved the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket squaring her yards she bore down ranged abeam under the pequod's lee and lowered a boat it soon drew nigh but as the side-ladder was being rigged by starbuck's order to accommodate the visiting captain the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat's stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary it turned out that the jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board and that mayhew her captain was fearful of infecting the pequod's company for though himself and boat's crew remained untainted and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the pequod but this did by no means prevent all communications preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship the jeroboam's boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the pequod as she heavily forged through the sea for by this time it blew very fresh with her main-topsail aback though indeed at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave the boat would be pushed some way ahead but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again subject to this and other the like interruptions now and then a conversation was sustained between the two parties but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort pulling an oar in the jeroboam's boat was a man of a singular appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities he was a small short youngish man sprinkled all over his face with freckles and wearing redundant yellow hair a long-skirted cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists a deep settled fanatic delirium was in his eyes so soon as this figure had been first descried stubb had exclaimed -- that's he that's he -- the long-togged scaramouch the town-ho's company told us of stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some time previous when the pequod spoke the town-ho according to this account and what was subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the jeroboam his story was this he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna shakers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trap-door announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial which he carried in his vest-pocket but which instead of containing gunpowder was supposed to be charged with laudanum a strange apostolic whim having seized him he had left neskyeuna for nantucket where with that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumed a steady common-sense exterior and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the jeroboam's whaling voyage they engaged him but straightway upon the ship's getting out of sight of land his insanity broke out in a freshet he announced himself as the archangel gabriel and commanded the captain to jump overboard he published his manifesto whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all oceanica the unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things -- the dark daring play of his sleepless excited imagination and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium united to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness moreover they were afraid of him as such a man however was not of much practical use in the ship especially as he refused to work except when he pleased the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him but apprised that that individual's intention was to land him in the first convenient port the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials -- devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition in case this intention was carried out so strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if gabriel was sent from the ship not a man of them would remain he was therefore forced to relinquish his plan nor would they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what he would so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship the consequence of all this was that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates and since the epidemic had broken out he carried a higher hand than ever declaring that the plague as he called it was at his sole command nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure the sailors mostly poor devils cringed and some of them fawned before him in obedience to his instructions sometimes rendering him personal homage as to a god such things may seem incredible but however wondrous they are true nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself as his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others but it is time to return to the pequod i fear not thy epidemic man said ahab from the bulwarks to captain mayhew who stood in the boat's stern come on board but now gabriel started to his feet think think of the fevers yellow and bilious beware of the horrible plague gabriel gabriel cried captain mayhew thou must either -- but that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and its seethings drowned all speech hast thou seen the white whale demanded ahab when the boat drifted back think think of thy whale-boat stoven and sunk beware of the horrible tail i tell thee again gabriel that -- but again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends nothing was said for some moments while a succession of riotous waves rolled by which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling not heaving it meantime the hoisted sperm whale's head jogged about very violently and gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant when this interlude was over captain mayhew began a dark story concerning moby dick not however without frequent interruptions from gabriel whenever his name was mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home when upon speaking a whale-ship her people were reliably apprised of the existence of moby dick and the havoc he had made greedily sucking in this intelligence gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the white whale in case the monster should be seen in his gibbering insanity pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than the shaker god incarnated the shakers receiving the bible but when some year or two afterwards moby dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads macey the chief mate burned with ardour to encounter him and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity despite all the archangel's denunciations and forewarnings macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat with them he pushed off and after much weary pulling and many perilous unsuccessful onsets he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast meantime gabriel ascending to the main-royal mast-head was tossing one arm in frantic gestures and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity now while macey the mate was standing up in his boat's bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a broad white shadow rose from the sea by its quick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen next instant the luckless mate so full of furious life was smitten bodily into the air and making a long arc in his descent fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards not a chip of the boat was harmed nor a hair of any oarsman's head but the mate for ever sank it is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in the sperm-whale fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any sometimes nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated oftener the boat's bow is knocked off or the thigh-board in which the headsman stands is torn from its place and accompanies the body but strangest of all is the circumstance that in more instances than one when the body has been recovered not a single mark of violence is discernible the man being stark dead the whole calamity with the falling form of macey was plainly descried from the ship raising a piercing shriek -- the vial the vial gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale this terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically fore-announced it instead of only making a general prophecy which any one might have done and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed he became a nameless terror to the ship mayhew having concluded his narration ahab put such questions to him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer to which ahab answered -- aye straightway then gabriel once more started to his feet glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed with downward pointed finger -- think think of the blasphemer -- dead and down there -- beware of the blasphemer's end ahab stolidly turned aside then said to mayhew captain i have just bethought me of my letter-bag there is a letter for one of thy officers if i mistake not starbuck look over the bag every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans thus most letters never reach their mark and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand it was sorely tumbled damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin of such a letter death himself might well have been the post-boy can'st not read it cried ahab give it me man aye aye it's but a dim scrawl -- what's this as he was studying it out starbuck took a long cutting-spade pole and with his knife slightly split the end to insert the letter there and in that way hand it to the boat without its coming any closer to the ship meantime ahab holding the letter muttered mr har -- yes mr harry -- a woman's pinny hand -- the man's wife i'll wager -- aye -- mr harry macey ship jeroboam -- why it's macey and he's dead poor fellow poor fellow and from his wife sighed mayhew but let me have it nay keep it thyself cried gabriel to ahab thou art soon going that way curses throttle thee yelled ahab captain mayhew stand by now to receive it and taking the fatal missive from starbuck's hands he caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards the boat but as he did so the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing the boat drifted a little towards the ship's stern so that as if by magic the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriel's eager hand he clutched it in an instant seized the boat-knife and impaling the letter on it sent it thus loaded back into the ship it fell at ahab's feet then gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the pequod as after this interlude the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair chapter 72 the monkey-rope in the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew now hands are wanted here and then again hands are wanted there there is no staying in any one place for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere it is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene we must now retrace our way a little it was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale's back the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole it was inserted there by my particular friend queequeg whose duty it was as harpooneer to descend upon the monster's back for the special purpose referred to but in very many cases circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded the whale be it observed lies almost entirely submerged excepting the immediate parts operated upon so down there some ten feet below the level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounders about half on the whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him on the occasion in question queequeg figured in the highland costume -- a shirt and socks -- in which to my eyes at least he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a better chance to observe him as will presently be seen being the savage's bowsman that is the person who pulled the bow-oar in his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale's back you have seen italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord just so from the ship's steep side did i hold queequeg down there in the sea by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist it was a humorously perilous business for both of us for before we proceed further it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends fast to queequeg's broad canvas belt and fast to my narrow leather one so that for better or for worse we two for the time were wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then both usage and honour demanded that instead of cutting the cord it should drag me down in his wake so then an elongated siamese ligature united us queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother nor could i any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then that while earnestly watching his motions i seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two that my free will had received a mortal wound and that another's mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death therefore i saw that here was a sort of interregnum in providence for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice and yet still further pondering -- while i jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam him -- still further pondering i say i saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in most cases he one way or other has this siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals if your banker breaks you snap if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills you die true you may say that by exceeding caution you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life but handle queequeg's monkey-rope heedfully as i would sometimes he jerked it so that i came very near sliding overboard nor could i possibly forget that do what i would i only had the management of one end of it the monkey-rope is found in all whalers but it was only in the pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together this improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than stubb in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the whale and the ship -- where he would occasionally fall from the incessant rolling and swaying of both but this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass -- the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive and right in among those sharks was queequeg who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet a thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man nevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them accordingly besides the monkey-rope with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark -- he was provided with still another protection suspended over the side in one of the stages tashtego and daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale-spades wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach this procedure of theirs to be sure was very disinterested and benevolent of them they meant queequeg's best happiness i admit but in their hasty zeal to befriend him and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall but poor queequeg i suppose straining and gasping there with that great iron hook -- poor queequeg i suppose only prayed to his yojo and gave up his life into the hands of his gods well well my dear comrade and twin-brother thought i as i drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea -- what matters it after all are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world that unsounded ocean you gasp in is life those sharks your foes those spades your friends and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad but courage there is good cheer in store for you queequeg for now as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side the steward advances and with a benevolent consolatory glance hands him -- what some hot cognac no hands him ye gods hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water ginger do i smell ginger suspiciously asked stubb coming near yes this must be ginger peering into the as yet untasted cup then standing as if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying ginger ginger and will you have the goodness to tell me mr dough-boy where lies the virtue of ginger ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use dough-boy to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal ginger -- what the devil is ginger -- sea-coal firewood -- lucifer matches -- tinder -- gunpowder -- what the devil is ginger i say that you offer this cup to our poor queequeg here there is some sneaking temperance society movement about this business he suddenly added now approaching starbuck who had just come from forward will you look at that kannakin sir smell of it if you please then watching the mate's countenance he added the steward mr starbuck had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to queequeg there this instant off the whale is the steward an apothecary sir and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man i trust not said starbuck it is poor stuff enough aye aye steward cried stubb we'll teach you to drug it harpooneer none of your apothecary's medicine here you want to poison us do ye you have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all and pocket the proceeds do ye it was not me cried dough-boy it was aunt charity that brought the ginger on board and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits but only this ginger-jub -- so she called it ginger-jub you gingerly rascal take that and run along with ye to the lockers and get something better i hope i do no wrong mr starbuck it is the captain's orders -- grog for the harpooneer on a whale enough replied starbuck only don't hit him again but -- oh i never hurt when i hit except when i hit a whale or something of that sort and this fellow's a weazel what were you about saying sir only this go down with him and get what thou wantest thyself when stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort of tea-caddy in the other the first contained strong spirits and was handed to queequeg the second was aunt charity's gift and that was freely given to the waves chapter 73 stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have a talk over him it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whale's prodigious head hanging to the pequod's side but we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it for the present other matters press and the best we can do now for the head is to pray heaven the tackles may hold now during the past night and forenoon the pequod had gradually drifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow brit gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales a species of the leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near and though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures and though the pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all and though she had passed numbers of them near the crozetts without lowering a boat yet now that a sperm whale had been brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all the announcement was made that a right whale should be captured that day if opportunity offered nor was this long wanting tall spouts were seen to leeward and two boats stubb's and flask's were detached in pursuit pulling further and further away they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast-head but suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast an interval passed and the boats were in plain sight in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in a maelstrom within three rods of the planks he wholly disappeared from view as if diving under the keel cut cut was the cry from the ship to the boats which for one instant seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel's side but having plenty of line yet in the tubs and the whale not sounding very rapidly they paid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship for a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction and still plied their oars in another the contending strain threatened to take them under but it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain and they stuck to it till they did gain it when instantly a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel as the strained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose to view under her bows snapping and quivering and so flinging off its drippings that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water while the whale beyond also rose to sight and once more the boats were free to fly but the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him so that they performed a complete circuit meantime they hauled more and more upon their lines till close flanking him on both sides stubb answered flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the pequod the battle went while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whale's body rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirstily drinking at every new gash as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock at last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit he turned upon his back a corpse while the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing some conversation ensued between them i wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard said stubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan wants with it said flask coiling some spare line in the boat's bow did you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whale's head hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a right whale's on the larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship can never afterwards capsize why not i don't know but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so and he seems to know all about ships' charms but i sometimes think he'll charm the ship to no good at last i don't half like that chap stubb did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake's head stubb sink him i never look at him at all but if ever i get a chance of a dark night and he standing hard by the bulwarks and no one by look down there flask -- pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands -- aye will i flask i take that fedallah to be the devil in disguise do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship he's the devil i say the reason why you don't see his tail is because he tucks it up out of sight he carries it coiled away in his pocket i guess blast him now that i think of it he's always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots he sleeps in his boots don't he he hasn't got any hammock but i've seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging no doubt and it's because of his cursed tail he coils it down do ye see in the eye of the rigging what's the old man have so much to do with him for striking up a swap or a bargain i suppose bargain -- about what why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that white whale and the devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap away his silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then he'll surrender moby dick pooh stubb you are skylarking how can fedallah do that i don't know flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked one i tell ye why they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship once switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor was at home well he was at home and asked the devil what he wanted the devil switching his hoofs up and says 'i want john ' 'what for ' says the old governor 'what business is that of yours ' says the devil getting mad -- 'i want to use him ' 'take him ' says the governor -- and by the lord flask if the devil didn't give john the asiatic cholera before he got through with him i'll eat this whale in one mouthful but look sharp -- ain't you all ready there well then pull ahead and let's get the whale alongside i think i remember some such story as you were telling said flask when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship but i can't remember where three spaniards adventures of those three bloody-minded soladoes did ye read it there flask i guess ye did no never saw such a book heard of it though but now tell me stubb do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now was the same you say is now on board the pequod am i the same man that helped kill this whale doesn't the devil live for ever who ever heard that the devil was dead did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil and if the devil has a latch-key to get into the admiral's cabin don't you suppose he can crawl into a porthole tell me that mr flask how old do you suppose fedallah is stubb do you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship well that's the figure one now take all the hoops in the pequod's hold and string along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that wouldn't begin to be fedallah's age nor all the coopers in creation couldn't show hoops enough to make oughts enough but see here stubb i thought you a little boasted just now that you meant to give fedallah a sea-toss if you got a good chance now if he's so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he is going to live for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboard -- tell me that give him a good ducking anyhow but he'd crawl back duck him again and keep ducking him suppose he should take it into his head to duck you though -- yes and drown you -- what then i should like to see him try it i'd give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn't dare to show his face in the admiral's cabin again for a long while let alone down in the orlop there where he lives and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much damn the devil flask so you suppose i'm afraid of the devil who's afraid of him except the old governor who daresn't catch him and put him in double-darbies as he deserves but lets him go about kidnapping people aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil kidnapped he'd roast for him there's a governor do you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahab do i suppose it you'll know it before long flask but i am going now to keep a sharp look-out on him and if i see anything very suspicious going on i'll just take him by the nape of his neck and say -- look here beelzebub you don't do it and if he makes any fuss by the lord i'll make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstan and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will come short off at the stump -- do you see and then i rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion he'll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs and what will you do with the tail stubb do with it sell it for an ox whip when we get home -- what else now do you mean what you say and have been saying all along stubb mean or not mean here we are at the ship the boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard side where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him didn't i tell you so said flask yes you'll soon see this right whale's head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti's in good time flask's saying proved true as before the pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale's head now by the counterpoise of both heads she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may well believe so when on one side you hoist in locke's head you go over that way but now on the other side hoist in kant's and you come back again but in very poor plight thus some minds for ever keep trimming boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunder-heads overboard and then you will float light and right in disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the ship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown-piece but nothing like this in the present case had been done the carcases of both whales had dropped astern and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers meantime fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale's head and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand and ahab chanced so to stand that the parsee occupied his shadow while if the parsee's shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with and lengthen ahab's as the crew toiled on laplandish speculations were bandied among them concerning all these passing things chapter 74 the sperm whale's head -- contrasted view here now are two great whales laying their heads together let us join them and lay together our own of the grand order of folio leviathans the sperm whale and the right whale are by far the most noteworthy they are the only whales regularly hunted by man to the nantucketer they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale as the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the pequod's side and as we may freely go from one to the other by merely stepping across the deck -- where i should like to know will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here in the first place you are struck by the general contrast between these heads both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale's which the right whale's sadly lacks there is more character in the sperm whale's head as you behold it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him in point of pervading dignity in the present instance too this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit giving token of advanced age and large experience in short he is what the fishermen technically call a grey-headed whale let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads -- namely the two most important organs the eye and the ear far back on the side of the head and low down near the angle of either whale's jaw if you narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would fancy to be a young colt's eye so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head now from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no more than he can one exactly astern in a word the position of the whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears and you may fancy for yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey objects through your ears you would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight and about thirty more behind it if your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad day you would not be able to see him any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind in a word you would have two backs so to speak but at the same time also two fronts side fronts for what is it that makes the front of a man -- what indeed but his eyes moreover while in most other animals that i can now think of the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiar position of the whale's eyes effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys this of course must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts the whale therefore must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct picture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him man may in effect be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window but with the whale these two sashes are separately inserted making two distinct windows but sadly impairing the view this peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the leviathan but i must be content with a hint so long as a man's eyes are open in the light the act of seeing is involuntary that is he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him nevertheless any one's experience will teach him that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively and completely to examine any two things -- however large or however small -- at one and the same instant of time never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other but if you now come to separate these two objects and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in order to see one of them in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness how is it then with the whale true both his eyes in themselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much more comprehensive combining and subtle than man's that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects one on one side of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction if he can then is it as marvellous a thing in him as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in euclid nor strictly investigated is there any incongruity in this comparison it may be but an idle whim but it has always seemed to me that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats the timidity and liability to queer frights so common to such whales i think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye if you are an entire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two heads for hours and never discover that organ the ear has no external leaf whatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill so wondrously minute is it it is lodged a little behind the eye with respect to their ears this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right while the ear of the former has an external opening that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from without is it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare's but if his eyes were broad as the lens of herschel's great telescope and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals would that make him any longer of sight or sharper of hearing not at all -- why then do you try to enlarge your mind subtilize it let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand cant over the sperm whale's head that it may lie bottom up then ascending by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach but let us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are what a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth from floor to ceiling lined or rather papered with a glistening white membrane glossy as bridal satins but come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box with the hinge at one end instead of one side if you pry it up so as to get it overhead and expose its rows of teeth it seems a terrific portcullis and such alas it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force but far more terrible is it to behold when fathoms down in the sea you see some sulky whale floating there suspended with his prodigious jaw some fifteen feet long hanging straight down at right-angles with his body for all the world like a ship's jib-boom this whale is not dead he is only dispirited out of sorts perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight a reproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lock-jaws upon him in most cases this lower jaw -- being easily unhinged by a practised artist -- is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles including canes umbrella-stocks and handles to riding-whips with a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were an anchor and when the proper time comes -- some few days after the other work -- queequeg daggoo and tashtego being all accomplished dentists are set to drawing teeth with a keen cutting-spade queequeg lances the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle being rigged from aloft they drag out these teeth as michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands there are generally forty-two teeth in all in old whales much worn down but undecayed nor filled after our artificial fashion the jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs and piled away like joists for building houses chapter 75 the right whale's head -- contrasted view crossing the deck let us now have a good long look at the right whale's head as in general shape the noble sperm whale's head may be compared to a roman war-chariot especially in front where it is so broadly rounded so at a broad view the right whale's head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe two hundred years ago an old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker's last and in this same last or shoe that old woman of the nursery tale with the swarming brood might very comfortably be lodged she and all her progeny but as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects according to your point of view if you stand on its summit and look at these two f-shaped spoutholes you would take the whole head for an enormous bass-viol and these spiracles the apertures in its sounding-board then again if you fix your eye upon this strange crested comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass -- this green barnacled thing which the greenlanders call the crown and the southern fishers the bonnet of the right whale fixing your eyes solely on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak with a bird's nest in its crotch at any rate when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you unless indeed your fancy has been fixed by the technical term crown also bestowed upon it in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner but if this whale be a king he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem look at that hanging lower lip what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by carpenter's measurement about twenty feet long and five feet deep a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more a great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped the fissure is about a foot across probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the peruvian coast when earthquakes caused the beach to gape over this lip as over a slippery threshold we now slide into the mouth upon my word were i at mackinaw i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam good lord is this the road that jonah went the roof is about twelve feet high and runs to a pretty sharp angle as if there were a regular ridge-pole there while these ribbed arched hairy sides present us with those wondrous half vertical scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone say three hundred on a side which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned the edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres through which the right whale strains the water and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time in the central blinds of bone as they stand in their natural order there are certain curious marks curves hollows and ridges whereby some whalemen calculate the creature's age as the age of an oak by its circular rings though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable yet it has the savor of analogical probability at any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable in old times there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these blinds one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous whiskers inside of the whale's mouth another hogs' bristles a third old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language there are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper chop which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth this reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker or rather a moustache consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance as every one knows these same hogs' bristles fins whiskers blinds or whatever you please furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances but in this particular the demand has long been on the decline it was in queen anne's time that the bone was in its glory the farthingale being then all the fashion and as those ancient dames moved about gaily though in the jaws of the whale as you may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone but now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment and standing in the right whale's mouth look around you afresh seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would you not think you were inside of the great haarlem organ and gazing upon its thousand pipes for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest turkey -- the tongue which is glued as it were to the floor of the mouth it is very fat and tender and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck this particular tongue now before us at a passing glance i should say it was a six-barreler that is it will yield you about that amount of oil ere this you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started with -- that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely different heads to sum up then in the right whale's there is no great well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible of a lower jaw like the sperm whale's nor in the sperm whale are there any of those blinds of bone no huge lower lip and scarcely anything of a tongue again the right whale has two external spout-holes the sperm whale only one look your last now on these venerable hooded heads while they yet lie together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea the other will not be very long in following can you catch the expression of the sperm whale's there it is the same he died with only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away i think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity born of a speculative indifference as to death but mark the other head's expression see that amazing lower lip pressed by accident against the vessel's side so as firmly to embrace the jaw does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death this right whale i take to have been a stoic the sperm whale a platonian who might have taken up spinoza in his latter years chapter 76 the battering-ram ere quitting for the nonce the sperm whale's head i would have you as a sensible physiologist simply -- particularly remark its front aspect in all its compacted collectedness i would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged there here is a vital point for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling but not the less true events perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head much in the same way indeed as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose and that what nose he has -- his spout hole -- is on the top of his head you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head nearly one third of his entire length from the front wherefore you must now have perceived that the front of the sperm whale's head is a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever furthermore you are now to consider that only in the extreme lower backward sloping part of the front of the head is there the slightest vestige of bone and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development so that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad finally though as will soon be revealed its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy in some previous place i have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale as the rind wraps an orange just so with the head but with this difference about the head this envelope though not so thick is of a boneless toughness inestimable by any man who has not handled it the severest pointed harpoon the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm impotently rebounds from it it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horses' hoofs i do not think that any sensation lurks in it bethink yourself also of another thing when two large loaded indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks what do the sailors do they do not suspend between them at the point of coming contact any merely hard substance like iron or wood no they hold there a large round wad of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide that bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars by itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at but supplementary to this it has hypothetically occurred to me that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them capable at will of distension or contraction and as the sperm whale as far as i know has no such provision in him considering too the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope considering the unique interior of his head it has hypothetically occurred to me i say that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction if this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that might to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes now mark unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurable wall and this most buoyant thing within there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is -- by the cord and all obedient to one volition as the smallest insect so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster when i shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats i trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though the sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien and mixed the atlantic with the pacific you would not elevate one hair of your eye-brow for unless you own the whale you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth but clear truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter how small the chances for the provincials then what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess's veil at lais chapter 77 the great heidelburgh tun now comes the baling of the case but to comprehend it aright you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon regarding the sperm whale's head as a solid oblong you may on an inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof the lower is the bony structure forming the cranium and jaws and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale at the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have two almost equal parts which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance quoin is not a euclidean term it belongs to the pure nautical mathematics i know not that it has been defined before a quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both sides the lower subdivided part called the junk is one immense honeycomb of oil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousand infiltrated cells of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent the upper part known as the case may be regarded as the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale and as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front so the whale's vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun moreover as that of heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages namely the highly-prized spermaceti in its absolutely pure limpid and odoriferous state nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature though in life it remains perfectly fluid yet upon exposure to the air after death it soon begins to concrete sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water a large whale's case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm though from unavoidable circumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks and dribbles away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun was coated within but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane like the lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface of the sperm whale's case it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head and since -- as has been elsewhere set forth -- the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship's side as in decapitating the whale the operator's instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine he has therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents it is this decapitated end of the head also which is at last elevated out of the water and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles whose hempen combinations on one side make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter thus much being said attend now i pray you to that marvellous and -- in this particular instance -- almost fatal operation whereby the sperm whale's great heidelburgh tun is tapped chapter 78 cistern and buckets nimble as a cat tashtego mounts aloft and without altering his erect posture runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun he has carried with him a light tackle called a whip consisting of only two parts travelling through a single-sheaved block securing this block so that it hangs down from the yard-arm he swings one end of the rope till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck then hand-over-hand down the other part the indian drops through the air till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head there -- still high elevated above the rest of the company to whom he vivaciously cries -- he seems some turkish muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower a short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun in this business he proceeds very heedfully like a treasure-hunter in some old house sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in by the time this cautious search is over a stout iron-bound bucket precisely like a well-bucket has been attached to one end of the whip while the other end being stretched across the deck is there held by two or three alert hands these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian to whom another person has reached up a very long pole inserting this pole into the bucket tashtego downward guides the bucket into the tun till it entirely disappears then giving the word to the seamen at the whip up comes the bucket again all bubbling like a dairy-maid's pail of new milk carefully lowered from its height the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand and quickly emptied into a large tub then remounting aloft it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more towards the end tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder and deeper and deeper into the tun until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down now the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm when all at once a queer accident happened whether it was that tashtego that wild indian was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy or whether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so without stating his particular reasons how it was exactly there is no telling now but on a sudden as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up -- my god poor tashtego -- like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well dropped head-foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling went clean out of sight man overboard cried daggoo who amid the general consternation first came to his senses swing the bucket this way and putting one foot into it so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head almost before tashtego could have reached its interior bottom meantime there was a terrible tumult looking over the side they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea as if that moment seized with some momentous idea whereas it was only the poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk at this instant while daggoo on the summit of the head was clearing the whip -- which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles -- a sharp cracking noise was heard and to the unspeakable horror of all one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg the one remaining hook upon which the entire strain now depended seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head come down come down yelled the seamen to daggoo but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles so that if the head should drop he would still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul line rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted out in heaven's name man cried stubb are you ramming home a cartridge there -- avast how will that help him jamming that iron-bound bucket on top of his head avast will ye stand clear of the tackle cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket almost in the same instant with a thunder-boom the enormous mass dropped into the sea like niagara's table-rock into the whirlpool the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glittering copper and all caught their breath as half swinging -- now over the sailors' heads and now over the water -- daggoo through a thick mist of spray was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles while poor buried-alive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea but hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away when a naked figure with a boarding-sword in his hand was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks the next a loud splash announced that my brave queequeg had dived to the rescue one packed rush was made to the side and every eye counted every ripple as moment followed moment and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen some hands now jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a little off from the ship ha ha cried daggoo all at once from his now quiet swinging perch overhead and looking further off from the side we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves a sight strange to see as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave both both -- it is both -- cried daggoo again with a joyful shout and soon after queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand and with the other clutching the long hair of the indian drawn into the waiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but tashtego was long in coming to and queequeg did not look very brisk now how had this noble rescue been accomplished why diving after the slowly descending head queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there then dropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards and so hauled out poor tash by the head he averred that upon first thrusting in for him a leg was presented but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be and might occasion great trouble -- he had thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss had wrought a somerset upon the indian so that with the next trial he came forth in the good old way -- head foremost as for the great head itself that was doing as well as could be expected and thus through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of queequeg the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego was successfully accomplished in the teeth too of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing riding and rowing i know that this queer adventure of the gay-header's will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one's falling into a cistern ashore an accident which not seldom happens and with much less reason too than the indian's considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the sperm whale's well but peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this we thought the tissued infiltrated head of the sperm whale was the lightest and most corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself we have thee there not at all but i have ye for at the time poor tash fell in the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well -- a double welded hammered substance as i have before said much heavier than the sea water and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost but the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed affording queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run as you may say yes it was a running delivery so it was now had tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious perishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale only one sweeter end can readily be recalled -- the delicious death of an ohio honey-hunter who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree found such exceeding store of it that leaning too far over it sucked him in so that he died embalmed how many think ye have likewise fallen into plato's honey head and sweetly perished there chapter 79 the prairie to scan the lines of his face or feel the bumps on the head of this leviathan this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist has as yet undertaken such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltar or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the pantheon still in that famous work of his lavater not only treats of the various faces of men but also attentively studies the faces of horses birds serpents and fish and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein nor have gall and his disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man therefore though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application of these two semi-sciences to the whale i will do my endeavor i try all things i achieve what i can physiognomically regarded the sperm whale is an anomalous creature he has no proper nose and since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression hence it would seem that its entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affect the countenance of the whale for as in landscape gardening a spire cupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose dash the nose from phidias's marble jove and what a sorry remainder nevertheless leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all his proportions are so stately that the same deficiency which in the sculptured jove were hideous in him is no blemish at all nay it is an added grandeur a nose to the whale would have been impertinent as on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly-boat your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled a pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne in some particulars perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the sperm whale is that of the full front of his head this aspect is sublime in thought a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the morning in the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles the elephant's brow is majestic human or animal the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the german emperors to their decrees it signifies -- god done this day by my hand but in most creatures nay in man himself very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line few are the foreheads which like shakespeare's or melancthon's rise so high and descend so low that the eyes themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lakes and all above them in the forehead's wrinkles you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink as the highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer but in the great sperm whale this high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature for you see no one point precisely not one distinct feature is revealed no nose eyes ears or mouth no face he has none proper nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead pleated with riddles dumbly lowering with the doom of boats and ships and men nor in profile does this wondrous brow diminish though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so in profile you plainly perceive that horizontal semi-crescentic depression in the forehead's middle which in man is lavater's mark of genius but how genius in the sperm whale has the sperm whale ever written a book spoken a speech no his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it it is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale been known to the young orient world he would have been deified by their child-magian thoughts they deified the crocodile of the nile because the crocodile is tongueless and the sperm whale has no tongue or at least it is so exceedingly small as to be incapable of protrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right the merry may-day gods of old and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalted to jove's high seat the great sperm whale shall lord it champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics but there is no champollion to decipher the egypt of every man's and every being's face physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing fable if then sir william jones who read in thirty languages could not read the simplest peasant's face in its profounder and more subtle meanings how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee of the sperm whale's brow i but put that brow before you read it if you can chapter 80 the nut if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square in the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length unhinge the lower jaw and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base but in life -- as we have elsewhere seen -- this inclined plane is angularly filled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm at the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this crater -- in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth -- reposes the mere handful of this monster's brain the brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden away behind its vast outworks like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of quebec so like a choice casket is it secreted in him that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine lying in strange folds courses and convolutions to their apprehensions it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence it is plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan in the creature's living intact state is an entire delusion as for his true brain you can then see no indications of it nor feel any the whale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to the common world if you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end which is the high end you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and from the same point of view indeed place this reversed skull scaled down to the human magnitude among a plate of men's skulls and you would involuntarily confound it with them and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit in phrenological phrase you would say -- this man had no self-esteem and no veneration and by those negations considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power you can best form to yourself the truest though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is but if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain you deem it incapable of being adequately charted then i have another idea for you if you attentively regard almost any quadruped's spine you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper it is a german conceit that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls but the curious external resemblance i take it the germans were not the first men to perceive a foreign friend once pointed it out to me in the skeleton of a foe he had slain and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying in a sort of basso-relievo the beaked prow of his canoe now i consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal for i believe that much of a man's character will be found betokened in his backbone i would rather feel your spine than your skull whoever you are a thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul i rejoice in my spine as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to the world apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale his cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across being eight in height and of a triangular figure with the base downwards as it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity now of course this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance -- the spinal cord -- as the brain and directly communicates with the brain and what is still more for many feet after emerging from the brain's cavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost equal to that of the brain under all these circumstances would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale's spine phrenologically for viewed in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord but leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists i would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the sperm whale's hump this august hump if i mistake not rises over one of the larger vertebrae and is therefore in some sort the outer convex mould of it from its relative situation then i should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm whale and that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have reason to know chapter 81 the pequod meets the virgin the predestinated day arrived and we duly met the ship jungfrau derick de deer master of bremen at one time the greatest whaling people in the world the dutch and germans are now among the least but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude you still occasionally meet with their flag in the pacific for some reason the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects while yet some distance from the pequod she rounded to and dropping a boat her captain was impelled towards us impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern what has he in his hand there cried starbuck pointing to something wavingly held by the german impossible -- a lamp-feeder not that said stubb no no it's a coffee-pot mr starbuck he's coming off to make us our coffee is the yarman don't you see that big tin can there alongside of him -- that's his boiling water oh he's all right is the yarman go along with you cried flask it's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can he's out of oil and has come a-begging however curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the whale-ground and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happens and in the present case captain derick de deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as flask did declare as he mounted the deck ahab abruptly accosted him without at all heeding what he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the german soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale immediately turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness -- his last drop of bremen oil being gone and not a single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the fishery is technically called a clean one that is an empty one well deserving the name of jungfrau or the virgin his necessities supplied derick departed but he had not gained his ship's side when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast-heads of both vessels and so eager for the chase was derick that without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders now the game having risen to leeward he and the other three german boats that soon followed him had considerably the start of the pequod's keels there were eight whales an average pod aware of their danger they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness they left a great wide wake as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea full in this rapid wake and many fathoms in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him seemed afflicted with the jaundice or some other infirmity whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance seemed questionable for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social nevertheless he stuck to their wake though indeed their back water must have retarded him because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet his spout was short slow and laborious coming forth with a choking sort of gush and spending itself in torn shreds followed by strange subterranean commotions in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity causing the waters behind him to upbubble who's got some paregoric said stubb he has the stomach-ache i'm afraid lord think of having half an acre of stomach-ache adverse winds are holding mad christmas in him boys it's the first foul wind i ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before it must be he's lost his tiller as an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses careens buries rolls and wallows on her way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin whether he had lost that fin in battle or had been born without it it were hard to say only wait a bit old chap and i'll give ye a sling for that wounded arm cried cruel flask pointing to the whale-line near him mind he don't sling thee with it cried starbuck give way or the german will have him with one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish because not only was he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he was nearest to them and the other whales were going with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit for the time at this juncture the pequod's keels had shot by the three german boats last lowered but from the great start he had had derick's boat still led the chase though every moment neared by his foreign rivals the only thing they feared was that from being already so nigh to his mark he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him as for derick he seemed quite confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats the ungracious and ungrateful dog cried starbuck he mocks and dares me with the very poor-box i filled for him not five minutes ago -- then in his old intense whisper -- give way greyhounds dog to it i tell ye what it is men -- cried stubb to his crew -- it's against my religion to get mad but i'd like to eat that villainous yarman -- pull -- won't ye are ye going to let that rascal beat ye do ye love brandy a hogshead of brandy then to the best man come why don't some of ye burst a blood-vessel who's that been dropping an anchor overboard -- we don't budge an inch -- we're becalmed halloo here's grass growing in the boat's bottom -- and by the lord the mast there's budding this won't do boys look at that yarman the short and long of it is men will ye spit fire or not oh see the suds he makes cried flask dancing up and down -- what a hump -- oh do pile on the beef -- lays like a log oh my lads do spring -- slap-jacks and quahogs for supper you know my lads -- baked clams and muffins -- oh do do spring -- he's a hundred barreller -- don't lose him now -- don't oh don't -- see that yarman -- oh won't ye pull for your duff my lads -- such a sog such a sogger don't ye love sperm there goes three thousand dollars men -- a bank -- a whole bank the bank of england -- oh do do do -- what's that yarman about now at this moment derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the advancing boats and also his oil-can perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals' way and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss the unmannerly dutch dogger cried stubb pull now men like fifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils what d'ye say tashtego are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for the honour of old gayhead what d'ye say i say pull like god-dam -- cried the indian fiercely but evenly incited by the taunts of the german the pequod's three boats now began ranging almost abreast and so disposed momentarily neared him in that fine loose chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey the three mates stood up proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of there she slides now hurrah for the white-ash breeze down with the yarman sail over him but so decided an original start had derick had that spite of all their gallantry he would have proved the victor in this race had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman while this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white-ash and while in consequence derick's boat was nigh to capsizing and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage -- that was a good time for starbuck stubb and flask with a shout they took a mortal start forwards and slantingly ranged up on the german's quarter an instant more and all four boats were diagonically in the whale's immediate wake while stretching from them on both sides was the foaming swell that he made it was a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight the whale was now going head out and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright now to this hand now to that he yawed in his faltering flight and still at every billow that he broke he spasmodically sank in the sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin so have i seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks but the bird has a voice and with plaintive cries will make known her fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea was chained up and enchanted in him he had no voice save that choking respiration through his spiracle and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable while still in his amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequod's boats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart ere the last chance would for ever escape but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three tigers -- queequeg tashtego daggoo -- instinctively sprang to their feet and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointed their barbs and darted over the head of the german harpooneer their three nantucket irons entered the whale blinding vapours of foam and white-fire the three boats in the first fury of the whale's headlong rush bumped the german's aside with such force that both derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three flying keels don't be afraid my butter-boxes cried stubb casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by ye'll be picked up presently -- all right -- i saw some sharks astern -- st bernard's dogs you know -- relieve distressed travellers hurrah this is the way to sail now every keel a sunbeam hurrah -- here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar this puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain -- makes the wheel-spokes fly boys when you fasten to him that way and there's danger of being pitched out too when you strike a hill hurrah this is the way a fellow feels when he's going to davy jones -- all a rush down an endless inclined plane hurrah this whale carries the everlasting mail but the monster's run was a brief one giving a sudden gasp he tumultuously sounded with a grating rush the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines that using all their dexterous might they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on till at last -- owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the boats whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue -- the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water while the three sterns tilted high in the air and the whale soon ceasing to sound for some time they remained in that attitude fearful of expending more line though the position was a little ticklish but though boats have been taken down and lost in this way yet it is this holding on as it is called this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes yet not to speak of the peril of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken whale stays under water the more he is exhausted because owing to the enormous surface of him -- in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet -- the pressure of the water is immense we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under even here above-ground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean it must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres one whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships with all their guns and stores and men on board as the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down into its eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of any sort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths what landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and placidity the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock suspended and to what to three bits of board is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said -- canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish-spears the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as straw the arrow cannot make him flee darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear this the creature this he oh that unfulfilments should follow the prophets for with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea to hide him from the pequod's fish-spears in that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half xerxes' army who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head stand by men he stirs cried starbuck as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them as by magnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that every oarsman felt them in his seat the next moment relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards as a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea haul in haul in cried starbuck again he's rising the lines of which hardly an instant before not one hand's breadth could have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within two ship's lengths of the hunters his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion in most land animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins whereby when wounded the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions not so with the whale one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him and so distant and numerous its interior fountains that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period even as in a drought a river will flow whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills even now when the boats pulled upon this whale and perilously drew over his swaying flukes and the lances were darted into him they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept continually playing while the natural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals however rapid sending its affrighted moisture into the air from this last vent no blood yet came because no vital part of him had thus far been struck his life as they significantly call it was untouched as the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part of his form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainly revealed his eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were beheld as strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate so from the points which the whale's eyes had once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to see but pity there was none for all his old age and his one arm and his blind eyes he must die the death and be murdered in order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all still rolling in his blood at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the flank a nice spot cried flask just let me prick him there once avast cried starbuck there's no need of that but humane starbuck was too late at the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift fury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore capsizing flask's boat and marring the bows it was his death stroke for by this time so spent was he by loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped fin then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up the white secrets of his belly lay like a log and died it was most piteous that last expiring spout as when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground -- so the last long dying spout of the whale soon while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled immediately by starbuck's orders lines were secured to it at different points so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords by very heedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale was transferred to her side and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains for it was plain that unless artificially upheld the body would at once sink to the bottom it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh on the lower part of the bunch before described but as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to but still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him not far from the buried iron the flesh perfectly firm about it who had darted that stone lance and when it might have been darted by some nor' west indian long before america was discovered what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling but a sudden stop was put to further discoveries by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea owing to the body's immensely increasing tendency to sink however starbuck who had the ordering of affairs hung on to it to the last hung on to it so resolutely indeed that when at length the ship would have been capsized if still persisting in locking arms with the body then when the command was given to break clear from it such was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were fastened that it was impossible to cast them off meantime everything in the pequod was aslant to cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house the ship groaned and gasped many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places by the unnatural dislocation in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over hold on hold on won't ye cried stubb to the body don't be in such a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder men we must do something or go for it no use prying there avast i say with your handspikes and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife and cut the big chains knife aye aye cried queequeg and seizing the carpenter's heavy hatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing at the largest fluke-chains but a few strokes full of sparks were given when the exceeding strain effected the rest with a terrific snap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sank now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm whale is a very curious thing nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it usually the dead sperm whale floats with great buoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface if the only whales that thus sank were old meagre and broken-hearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him but it is not so for young whales in the highest health and swelling with noble aspirations prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of life with all their panting lard about them even these brawny buoyant heroes do sometimes sink be it said however that the sperm whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species where one of that sort go down twenty right whales do this difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free but there are instances where after the lapse of many hours or several days the sunken whale again rises more buoyant than in life but the reason of this is obvious gases are generated in him he swells to a prodigious magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon a line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then in the shore whaling on soundings among the bays of new zealand when a right whale gives token of sinking they fasten buoys to him with plenty of rope so that when the body has gone down they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again it was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the pequod's mast-heads announcing that the jungfrau was again lowering her boats though the only spout in sight was that of a fin-back belonging to the species of uncapturable whales because of its incredible power of swimming nevertheless the fin-back's spout is so similar to the sperm whale's that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it and consequently derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute the virgin crowding all sail made after her four young keels and thus they all disappeared far to leeward still in bold hopeful chase oh many are the fin-backs and many are the dericks my friend chapter 82 the honour and glory of whaling there are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method the more i dive into this matter of whaling and push my researches up to the very spring-head of it so much the more am i impressed with its great honourableness and antiquity and especially when i find so many great demi-gods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one way or other have shed distinction upon it i am transported with the reflection that i myself belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a fraternity the gallant perseus a son of jupiter was the first whaleman and to the eternal honour of our calling be it said that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent those were the knightly days of our profession when we only bore arms to succor the distressed and not to fill men's lamp-feeders every one knows the fine story of perseus and andromeda how the lovely andromeda the daughter of a king was tied to a rock on the sea-coast and as leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off perseus the prince of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster and delivered and married the maid it was an admirable artistic exploit rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day inasmuch as this leviathan was slain at the very first dart and let no man doubt this arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syrian coast in one of the pagan temples there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale which the city's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew when the romans took joppa the same skeleton was carried to italy in triumph what seems most singular and suggestively important in this story is this it was from joppa that jonah set sail akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda -- indeed by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it -- is that famous story of st george and the dragon which dragon i maintain to have been a whale for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together and often stand for each other thou art as a lion of the waters and as a dragon of the sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale in truth some versions of the bible use that word itself besides it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st george but encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep any man may kill a snake but only a perseus a st george a coffin have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin-like shape and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback yet considering the great ignorance of those times when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists and considering that as in perseus' case st george's whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach and considering that the animal ridden by st george might have been only a large seal or sea-horse bearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene to hold this so-called dragon no other than the great leviathan himself in fact placed before the strict and piercing truth this whole story will fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the philistines dagon by name who being planted before the ark of israel his horse's head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him and only the stump or fishy part of him remained thus then one of our own noble stamp even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of england and by good rights we harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of st george and therefore let not the knights of that honourable company none of whom i venture to say have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron let them never eye a nantucketer with disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to st george's decoration than they whether to admit hercules among us or not concerning this i long remained dubious for though according to the greek mythologies that antique crockett and kit carson -- that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him that might be mooted it nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish unless indeed from the inside nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale i claim him for one of our clan but by the best contradictory authorities this grecian story of hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice versa certainly they are very similar if i claim the demigod then why not the prophet nor do heroes saints demigods and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order our grand master is still to be named for like royal kings of old times we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves that wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the shaster which gives us the dread vishnoo one of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos gives us this divine vishnoo himself for our lord -- vishnoo who by the first of his ten earthly incarnations has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale when brahma or the god of gods saith the shaster resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions he gave birth to vishnoo to preside over the work but the vedas or mystical books whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before beginning the creation and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects these vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths rescued the sacred volumes was not this vishnoo a whaleman then even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman perseus st george hercules jonah and vishnoo there's a member-roll for you what club but the whaleman's can head off like that chapter 83 jonah historically regarded reference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter now some nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of jonah and the whale but then there were some sceptical greeks and romans who standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts for all that one old sag-harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the hebrew story was this -- he had one of those quaint old-fashioned bibles embellished with curious unscientific plates one of which represented jonah's whale with two spouts in his head -- a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the leviathan the right whale and the varieties of that order concerning which the fishermen have this saying a penny roll would choke him his swallow is so very small but to this bishop jebb's anticipative answer is ready it is not necessary hints the bishop that we consider jonah as tombed in the whale's belly but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth and this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop for truly the right whale's mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables and comfortably seat all the players possibly too jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thoughts the right whale is toothless another reason which sag-harbor he went by that name urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices but this objection likewise falls to the ground because a german exegetist supposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale -- even as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents and crawled into them besides it has been divined by other continental commentators that when jonah was thrown overboard from the joppa ship he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a figure-head and i would add possibly called the whale as some craft are nowadays christened the shark the gull the eagle nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a life-preserver -- an inflated bag of wind -- which the endangered prophet swam to and so was saved from a watery doom poor sag-harbor therefore seems worsted all round but he had still another reason for his want of faith it was this if i remember right jonah was swallowed by the whale in the mediterranean sea and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days' journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very much more than three days' journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast how is that but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of nineveh yes he might have carried him round by the way of the cape of good hope but not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the mediterranean and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all africa in three days not to speak of the tigris waters near the site of nineveh being too shallow for any whale to swim in besides this idea of jonah's weathering the cape of good hope at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great headland from bartholomew diaz its reputed discoverer and so make modern history a liar but all these foolish arguments of old sag-harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason -- a thing still more reprehensible in him seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea i say it only shows his foolish impious pride and abominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy for by a portuguese catholic priest this very idea of jonah's going to nineveh via the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle and so it was besides to this day the highly enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah and some three centuries ago an english traveller in old harris's voyages speaks of a turkish mosque built in honour of jonah in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil chapter 84 pitchpoling to make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriages are anointed and for much the same purpose some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage considering that oil and water are hostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau disappeared took more than customary pains in that occupation crawling under its bottom where it hung over the side and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft's bald keel he seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment nor did it remain unwarranted by the event towards noon whales were raised but so soon as the ship sailed down to them they turned and fled with swift precipitancy a disordered flight as of cleopatra's barges from actium nevertheless the boats pursued and stubb's was foremost by great exertion tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but the stricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontal flight with added fleetness such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it it became imperative to lance the flying whale or be content to lose him but to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible he swam so fast and furious what then remained of all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand and countless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling small sword or broad sword in all its exercises boasts nothing like it it is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extreme headway steel and wood included the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon and also of a lighter material -- pine it is furnished with a small rope called a warp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting but before going further it is important to mention here that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it is seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks as a general thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before any pitchpoling comes into play look now at stubb a man who from his humorous deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling look at him he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale is forty feet ahead handling the long lance lightly glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand so as to secure its free end in his grasp leaving the rest unobstructed then holding the lance full before his waistband's middle he levels it at the whale when covering him with it he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm fifteen feet in the air he minds you somewhat of a juggler balancing a long staff on his chin next moment with a rapid nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance and quivers in the life spot of the whale instead of sparkling water he now spouts red blood that drove the spigot out of him cried stubb 'tis july's immortal fourth all fountains must run wine today would now it were old orleans whiskey or old ohio or unspeakable old monongahela then tashtego lad i'd have ye hold a canakin to the jet and we'd drink round it yea verily hearts alive we'd brew choice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there and from that live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff again and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart is repeated the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash the agonized whale goes into his flurry the tow-line is slackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern folds his hands and mutely watches the monster die chapter 85 the fountain that for six thousand years -- and no one knows how many millions of ages before -- the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots and that for some centuries back thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale watching these sprinklings and spoutings -- that all this should be and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o'clock p m of this sixteenth day of december a d 1851 it should still remain a problem whether these spoutings are after all really water or nothing but vapour -- this is surely a noteworthy thing let us then look at this matter along with some interesting items contingent every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim hence a herring or a cod might live a century and never once raise its head above the surface but owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs like a human being's the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world but he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitude the sperm whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface and what is still more his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth no he breathes through his spiracle alone and this is on the top of his head if i say that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle i do not think i shall err though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words assume it and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time that is to say he would then live without breathing anomalous as it may seem this is precisely the case with the whale who systematically lives by intervals his full hour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air for remember he has no gills how is this between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels which vessels when he quits the surface are completely distended with oxygenated blood so that for an hour or more a thousand fathoms in the sea he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true seems the more cogent to me when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out as the fishermen phrase it this is what i mean if unmolested upon rising to the surface the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings say he stays eleven minutes and jets seventy times that is respires seventy breaths then whenever he rises again he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again to a minute now if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him so that he sounds he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air and not till those seventy breaths are told will he finally go down to stay out his full term below remark however that in different individuals these rates are different but in any one they are alike now why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air ere descending for good how obvious is it too that this necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight not so much thy skill then o hunter as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee in man breathing is incessantly going on -- one breath only serving for two or three pulsations so that whatever other business he has to attend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will but the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time it has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole and being so clogged with two elements it could not be expected to have the power of smelling but owing to the mystery of the spout -- whether it be water or whether it be vapour -- no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head sure it is nevertheless that the sperm whale has no proper olfactories but what does he want of them no roses no violets no cologne-water in the sea furthermore as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal and as that long canal -- like the grand erie canal -- is furnished with a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale has no voice unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles he talks through his nose but then again what has the whale to say seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to this world unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living oh happy that the world is such an excellent listener now the spouting canal of the sperm whale chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air and for several feet laid along horizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little to one side this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street but the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe in other words whether the spout of the sperm whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth and discharged through the spiracle it is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be when in feeding he accidentally takes in water but the sperm whale's food is far beneath the surface and there he cannot spout even if he would besides if you regard him very closely and time him with your watch you will find that when unmolested there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject speak out you have seen him spout then declare what the spout is can you not tell water from air my dear sir in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things i have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all and as for this whale spout you might almost stand in it and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely the central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it when always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading all around him and if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapour or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure which is countersunk into the summit of the whale's head for even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in the desert even then the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout it will not do for him to be peering into it and putting his face in it you cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it and bring it away for even when coming into slight contact with the outer vapoury shreds of the jet which will often happen your skin will feverishly smart from the acridness of the thing so touching it and i know one who coming into still closer contact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view or otherwise i cannot say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm wherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try to evade it another thing i have heard it said and i do not much doubt it that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes it will blind you the wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me is to let this deadly spout alone still we can hypothesize even if we cannot prove and establish my hypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist and besides other reasons to this conclusion i am impelled by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale i account him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings or near shores all other whales sometimes are he is both ponderous and profound and i am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings such as plato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante and so on there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam while in the act of thinking deep thoughts while composing a little treatise on eternity i had the curiosity to place a mirror before me and ere long saw reflected there a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head the invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deep thought after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of an august noon this seems an additional argument for the above supposition and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty misty monster to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour engendered by his incommunicable contemplations and that vapour -- as you will sometimes see it -- glorified by a rainbow as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts for d'ye see rainbows do not visit the clear air they only irradiate vapour and so through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind divine intuitions now and then shoot enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray and for this i thank god for all have doubts many deny but doubts or denials few along with them have intuitions doubts of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly this combination makes neither believer nor infidel but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye chapter 86 the tail other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights less celestial i celebrate a tail reckoning the largest sized sperm whale's tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man it comprises upon its upper surface alone an area of at least fifty square feet the compact round body of its root expands into two broad firm flat palms or flukes gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness at the crotch or junction these flukes slightly overlap then sideways recede from each other like wings leaving a wide vacancy between in no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes at its utmost expansion in the full grown whale the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews but cut into it and you find that three distinct strata compose it -- upper middle and lower the fibres in the upper and lower layers are long and horizontal those of the middle one very short and running crosswise between the outside layers this triune structure as much as anything else imparts power to the tail to the student of old roman walls the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes insensibly blend with them and largely contribute to their might so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point could annihilation occur to matter this were the thing to do it nor does this -- its amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions where infantileness of ease undulates through a titanism of power on the contrary those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it real strength never impairs beauty or harmony but it often bestows it and in everything imposingly beautiful strength has much to do with the magic take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved hercules and its charm would be gone as devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man that seemed as a roman triumphal arch when angelo paints even god the father in human form mark what robustness is there and whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the son the soft curled hermaphroditical italian pictures in which his idea has been most successfully embodied these pictures so destitute as they are of all brawniness hint nothing of any power but the mere negative feminine one of submission and endurance which on all hands it is conceded form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of that whether wielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the mood it be in its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace therein no fairy's arm can transcend it five great motions are peculiar to it first when used as a fin for progression second when used as a mace in battle third in sweeping fourth in lobtailing fifth in peaking flukes first being horizontal in its position the leviathan's tail acts in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures it never wriggles in man or fish wriggling is a sign of inferiority to the whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion scroll-wise coiled forwards beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards it is this which gives that singular darting leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming his side-fins only serve to steer by second it is a little significant that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in his conflicts with man he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail in striking at a boat he swiftly curves away his flukes from it and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil if it be made in the unobstructed air especially if it descend to its mark the stroke is then simply irresistible no ribs of man or boat can withstand it your only salvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sideways through the opposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat and the elasticity of its materials a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is generally the most serious result these submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery that they are accounted mere child's play some one strips off a frock and the hole is stopped third i cannot demonstrate it but it seems to me that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant's trunk this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea and if he feel but a sailor's whisker woe to that sailor whiskers and all what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch had this tail any prehensile power i should straightway bethink me of darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the flower-market and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels and then caressed their zones on more accounts than one a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail for i have heard of yet another elephant that when wounded in the fight curved round his trunk and extracted the dart fourth stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity and kitten-like he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth but still you see his power in his play the broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air then smiting the surface the thunderous concussion resounds for miles you would almost think a great gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity you would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole fifth as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface but when he is about to plunge into the deeps his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air and so remain vibrating a moment till they downwards shoot out of view excepting the sublime breach -- somewhere else to be described -- this peaking of the whale's flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven so in dreams have i seen majestic satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell but in gazing at such scenes it is all in all what mood you are in if in the dantean the devils will occur to you if in that of isaiah the archangels standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea i once saw a large herd of whales in the east all heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes as it seemed to me at the time such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld even in persia the home of the fire worshippers as ptolemy philopater testified of the african elephant i then testified of the whale pronouncing him the most devout of all beings for according to king juba the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence the chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the elephant so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality much less the creatures to which they respectively belong for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to leviathan so compared with leviathan's tail his trunk is but the stalk of a lily the most direful blow from the elephant's trunk were as the playful tap of a fan compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air very much as an indian juggler tosses his balls though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant nevertheless there are not wanting some points of curious similitude among these is the spout it is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk and then elevating it jet it forth in a stream the more i consider this mighty tail the more do i deplore my inability to express it at times there are gestures in it which though they would well grace the hand of man remain wholly inexplicable in an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally are these mystic gestures that i have heard hunters who have declared them akin to free-mason signs and symbols that the whale indeed by these methods intelligently conversed with the world nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body full of strangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant dissect him how i may then i but go skin deep i know him not and never will but if i know not even the tail of this whale how understand his head much more how comprehend his face when face he has none thou shalt see my back parts my tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen but i cannot completely make out his back parts and hint what he will about his face i say again he has no face chapter 87 the grand armada the long and narrow peninsula of malacca extending south-eastward from the territories of birmah forms the most southerly point of all asia in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of sumatra java bally and timor which with many others form a vast mole or rampart lengthwise connecting asia with australia and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes this rampart is pierced by several sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales conspicuous among which are the straits of sunda and malacca by the straits of sunda chiefly vessels bound to china from the west emerge into the china seas those narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands buttressed by that bold green promontory known to seamen as java head they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices and silks and jewels and gold and ivory with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched it seems a significant provision of nature that such treasures by the very formation of the land should at least bear the appearance however ineffectual of being guarded from the all-grasping western world the shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the mediterranean the baltic and the propontis unlike the danes these orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of ships before the wind which for centuries past by night and by day have passed between the islands of sumatra and java freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east but while they freely waive a ceremonial like this they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of sumatra have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of european cruisers the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed yet even at the present day we occasionally hear of english and american vessels which in those waters have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged with a fair fresh wind the pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan sea and thence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented here and there by the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine islands and gain the far coast of japan in time for the great whaling season there by these means the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all the known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world previous to descending upon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit firmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick in the sea he was most known to frequent and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it but how now in this zoned quest does ahab touch no land does his crew drink air surely he will stop for water nay for a long time now the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring and needs no sustenance but what's in himself so ahab mark this too in the whaler while other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff to be transferred to foreign wharves the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew their weapons and their wants she has a whole lake's contents bottled in her ample hold she is ballasted with utilities not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge she carries years' water in her clear old prime nantucket water which when three years afloat the nantucketer in the pacific prefers to drink before the brackish fluid but yesterday rafted off in casks from the peruvian or indian streams hence it is that while other ships may have gone to china from new york and back again touching at a score of ports the whale-ship in all that interval may not have sighted one grain of soil her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves so that did you carry them the news that another flood had come they would only answer -- well boys here's the ark now as many sperm whales had been captured off the western coast of java in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda indeed as most of the ground roundabout was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising therefore as the pequod gained more and more upon java head the look-outs were repeatedly hailed and admonished to keep wide awake but though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air yet not a single jet was descried almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the straits when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us but here be it premised that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans the sperm whales instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies as in former times are now frequently met with in extensive herds sometimes embracing so great a multitude that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection to this aggregation of the sperm whale into such immense caravans may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands broad on both bows at the distance of some two or three miles and forming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the noon-day air unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the right whale which dividing at top fall over in two branches like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow the single forward-slanting spout of the sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continually rising and falling away to leeward seen from the pequod's deck then as she would rise on a high hill of the sea this host of vapoury spouts individually curling up into the air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis descried of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height as marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains accelerate their march all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle and swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centre crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them the harpooneers handling their weapons and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats if the wind only held little doubt had they that chased through these straits of sunda the vast host would only deploy into the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number and who could tell whether in that congregated caravan moby dick himself might not temporarily be swimming like the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the siamese so with stun-sail piled on stun-sail we sailed along driving these leviathans before us when of a sudden the voice of tashtego was heard loudly directing attention to something in our wake corresponding to the crescent in our van we beheld another in our rear it seemed formed of detached white vapours rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales only they did not so completely come and go for they constantly hovered without finally disappearing levelling his glass at this sight ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole crying aloft there and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails -- malays sir and after us as if too long lurking behind the headlands till the pequod should fairly have entered the straits these rascally asiatics were now in hot pursuit to make up for their over-cautious delay but when the swift pequod with a fresh leading wind was herself in hot chase how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit -- mere riding-whips and rowels to her that they were as with glass under arm ahab to-and-fro paced the deck in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him some such fancy as the above seemed his and when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance and beheld how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses -- when all these conceits had passed through his brain ahab's brow was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it without being able to drag the firm thing from its place but thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew and when after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern the pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra side emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond then the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the malays but still driving on in the wake of the whales at length they seemed abating their speed gradually the ship neared them and the wind now dying away word was passed to spring to the boats but no sooner did the herd by some presumed wonderful instinct of the sperm whale become notified of the three keels that were after them -- though as yet a mile in their rear -- than they rallied again and forming in close ranks and battalions so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets moved on with redoubled velocity stripped to our shirts and drawers we sprang to the white-ash and after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution which when the fishermen perceive it in the whale they say he is gallied the compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were now broken up in one measureless rout and like king porus' elephants in the indian battle with alexander they seemed going mad with consternation in all directions expanding in vast irregular circles and aimlessly swimming hither and thither by their short thick spoutings they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic this was still more strangely evinced by those of their number who completely paralysed as it were helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea had these leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay but this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures though banding together in tens of thousands the lion-maned buffaloes of the west have fled before a solitary horseman witness too all human beings how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit they will at the slightest alarm of fire rush helter-skelter for the outlets crowding trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each other to death best therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men though many of the whales as has been said were in violent motion yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated but collectively remained in one place as is customary in those cases the boats at once separated each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal in about three minutes' time queequeg's harpoon was flung the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces and then running away with us like light steered straight for the heart of the herd though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances is in no wise unprecedented and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery for as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb as blind and deaf the whale plunged forward as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him as we thus tore a white gash in the sea on all sides menaced as we flew by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed but not a bit daunted queequeg steered us manfully now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance now edging away from that whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead while all the time starbuck stood up in the bows lance in hand pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts for there was no time to make long ones nor were the oarsmen quite idle though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with they chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business out of the way commodore cried one to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface and for an instant threatened to swamp us hard down with your tail there cried a second to another which close to our gunwale seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity all whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances originally invented by the nantucket indians called druggs two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together so that they cross each other's grain at right angles a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block and the other end of the line being looped it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon it is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used for then more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time but sperm whales are not every day encountered while you may then you must kill all you can and if you cannot kill them all at once you must wing them so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure hence it is that at times like these the drugg comes into requisition our boat was furnished with three of them the first and second were successfully darted and we saw the whales staggeringly running off fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg they were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball but upon flinging the third in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block it caught under one of the seats of the boat and in an instant tore it out and carried it away dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the seat slid from under him on both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in and so stopped the leaks for the time it had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons were it not that as we advanced into the herd our whale's way greatly diminished moreover that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion the direful disorders seemed waning so that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out and the towing whale sideways vanished then with the tapering force of his parting momentum we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales were heard but not felt in this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface called a sleek produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods yes we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion and still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles and saw successive pods of whales eight or ten in each swiftly going round and round like multiplied spans of horses in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones and so have gone round on their backs owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us we must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up keeping at the centre of the lake we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves the women and children of this routed host now inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles the entire area at this juncture embraced by the whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square miles at any rate -- though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive -- spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon i mention this circumstance because as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping or possibly being so young unsophisticated and every way innocent and inexperienced however it may have been these smaller whales -- now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake -- evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at like household dogs they came snuffling round us right up to our gunwales and touching them till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them queequeg patted their foreheads starbuck scratched their backs with his lance but fearful of the consequences for the time refrained from darting it but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side for suspended in those watery vaults floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers the lake as i have hinted was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast as if leading two different lives at the time and while yet drawing mortal nourishment be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence -- even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us but not at us as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their new-born sight floating on their sides the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us one of these little infants that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old might have measured some fourteen feet in length and some six feet in girth he was a little frisky though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the final spring the unborn whale lies bent like a tartar's bow the delicate side-fins and the palms of his flukes still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from foreign parts line line cried queequeg looking over the gunwale him fast him fast -- who line him who struck -- two whale one big one little what ails ye man cried starbuck look-e here said queequeg pointing down as when the stricken whale that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope as after deep sounding he floats up again and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air so now starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of madame leviathan by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase this natural line with the maternal end loose becomes entangled with the hempen one so that the cub is thereby trapped some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond we saw young leviathan amours in the deep the sperm whale as with all other species of the leviathan but unlike most other fish breeds indifferently at all seasons after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months producing but one at a time though in some few known instances giving birth to an esau and jacob -- a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats curiously situated one on each side of the anus but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that when by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance the mother's pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods the milk is very sweet and rich it has been tasted by man it might do well with strawberries when overflowing with mutual esteem the whales salute more hominum and thus though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments yea serenely revelled in dalliance and delight but even so amid the tornadoed atlantic of my being do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me deep down and deep inland there i still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy meanwhile as we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them but the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles was nothing to what at last met our eyes it is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert to seek to hamstring him as it were by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon it is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again a whale wounded as we afterwards learned in this part but not effectually as it seemed had broken away from the boat carrying along with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of the wound he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado arnold at the battle of saratoga carrying dismay wherever he went but agonizing as was the wound of this whale and an appalling spectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us but at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh so that tormented to madness he was now churning through the water violently flailing with his flexible tail and tossing the keen spade about him wounding and murdering his own comrades this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright first the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if lifted by half spent billows from afar then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters yes the long calm was departing a low advancing hum was soon heard and then like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river hudson breaks up in spring the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain instantly starbuck and queequeg changed places starbuck taking the stern oars oars he intensely whispered seizing the helm -- gripe your oars and clutch your souls now my god men stand by shove him off you queequeg -- the whale there -- prick him -- hit him stand up -- stand up and stay so spring men -- pull men never mind their backs -- scrape them -- scrape away the boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks leaving a narrow dardanelles between their long lengths but by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving way rapidly and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet after many similar hair-breadth escapes we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles but now crossed by random whales all violently making for one centre this lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of queequeg's hat who while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement for having clumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness further pursuit was useless but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one which flask had killed and waifed the waif is a pennoned pole two or three of which are carried by every boat and which when additional game is at hand are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale both to mark its place on the sea and also as token of prior possession should the boats of any other ship draw near the result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the fishery -- the more whales the less fish of all the drugged whales only one was captured the rest contrived to escape for the time but only to be taken as will hereafter be seen by some other craft than the pequod chapter 88 schools and schoolmasters the previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of sperm whales and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations now though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as must have been seen even at the present day small detached bands are occasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each such bands are known as schools they generally are of two sorts those composed almost entirely of females and those mustering none but young vigorous males or bulls as they are familiarly designated in cavalier attendance upon the school of females you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies in truth this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming about over the watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem the contrast between this ottoman and his concubines is striking because while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions the ladies even at full growth are not more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male they are comparatively delicate indeed i dare say not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist nevertheless it cannot be denied that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to embonpoint it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings like fashionables they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety you meet them on the line in time for the full flower of the equatorial feeding season having just returned perhaps from spending the summer in the northern seas and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth by the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile they start for the oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year when serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strange suspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan coming that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him and chases him away high times indeed if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do what the bashaw will he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out of his bed for alas all fish bed in common as ashore the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers just so with the whales who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love they fence with their long lower jaws sometimes locking them together and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters -- furrowed heads broken teeth scolloped fins and in some instances wrenched and dislocated mouths but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harem's lord then is it very diverting to watch that lord gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines granting other whales to be in sight the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these grand turks for these grand turks are too lavish of their strength and hence their unctuousness is small as for the sons and the daughters they beget why those sons and daughters must take care of themselves at least with only the maternal help for like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named my lord whale has no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so being a great traveller he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world every baby an exotic in good time nevertheless as the ardour of youth declines as years and dumps increase as reflection lends her solemn pauses in short as a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens our ottoman enters upon the impotent repentant admonitory stage of life forswears disbands the harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old soul goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers and warning each young leviathan from his amorous errors now as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster it is therefore not in strict character however admirably satirical that after going to school himself he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there but the folly of it his title schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale must have read the memoirs of vidocq and informed himself what sort of a country-schoolmaster that famous frenchman was in his younger days and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years is true of all aged sperm whales almost universally a lone whale -- as a solitary leviathan is called -- proves an ancient one like venerable moss-bearded daniel boone he will have no one near him but nature herself and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters and the best of wives she is though she keeps so many moody secrets the schools composing none but young and vigorous males previously mentioned offer a strong contrast to the harem schools for while those female whales are characteristically timid the young males or forty-barrel-bulls as they call them are by far the most pugnacious of all leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter excepting those wondrous grey-headed grizzled whales sometimes met and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout the forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools like a mob of young collegians they are full of fight fun and wickedness tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at yale or harvard they soon relinquish this turbulence though and when about three-fourths grown break up and separately go about in quest of settlements that is harems another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes say you strike a forty-barrel-bull -- poor devil all his comrades quit him but strike a member of the harem school and her companions swim around her with every token of concern sometimes lingering so near her and so long as themselves to fall a prey chapter 89 fast-fish and loose-fish the allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge it frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company a whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and be finally killed and captured by another vessel and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies all partaking of this one grand feature for example -- after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a calm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or line thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen were there not some written or unwritten universal undisputed law applicable to all cases perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment was that of holland it was decreed by the states-general in a d 1695 but though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law yet the american fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter they have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses justinian's pandects and the by-laws of the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other people's business yes these laws might be engraven on a queen anne's forthing or the barb of a harpoon and worn round the neck so small are they i a fast-fish belongs to the party fast to it ii a loose-fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it but what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it first what is a fast-fish alive or dead a fish is technically fast when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants -- a mast an oar a nine-inch cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb it is all the same likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif or any other recognised symbol of possession so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside as well as their intention so to do these are scientific commentaries but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks -- the coke-upon-littleton of the fist true among the more upright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party but others are by no means so scrupulous some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in england wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the northern seas and when indeed they the plaintiffs had succeeded in harpooning the fish they were at last through peril of their lives obliged to forsake not only their lines but their boat itself ultimately the defendants the crew of another ship came up with the whale struck killed seized and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs and when those defendants were remonstrated with their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs' teeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done he would now retain their line harpoons and boat which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale line harpoons and boat mr erskine was counsel for the defendants lord ellenborough was the judge in the course of the defence the witty erskine went on to illustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim con case wherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wife's viciousness had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life but in the course of years repenting of that step he instituted an action to recover possession of her erskine was on the other side and he then supported it by saying that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady and had once had her fast and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness had at last abandoned her yet abandon her he did so that she became a loose-fish and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her the lady then became that subsequent gentleman's property along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her now in the present case erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other these pleadings and the counter pleadings being duly heard the very learned judge in set terms decided to wit -- that as for the boat he awarded it to the plaintiffs because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives but that with regard to the controverted whale harpoons and line they belonged to the defendants the whale because it was a loose-fish at the time of the final capture and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them it the fish acquired a property in those articles and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them now the defendants afterwards took the fish ergo the aforesaid articles were theirs a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might possibly object to it but ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in the above cited case these two laws touching fast-fish and loose-fish i say will on reflection be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture the temple of the law like the temple of the philistines has but two props to stand on is it not a saying in every one's mouth possession is half of the law that is regardless of how the thing came into possession but often possession is the whole of the law what are the sinews and souls of russian serfs and republican slaves but fast-fish whereof possession is the whole of the law what to the rapacious landlord is the widow's last mite but a fast-fish what is yonder undetected villain's marble mansion with a door-plate for a waif what is that but a fast-fish what is the ruinous discount which mordecai the broker gets from poor woebegone the bankrupt on a loan to keep woebegone's family from starvation what is that ruinous discount but a fast-fish what is the archbishop of savesoul's income of l100 000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers all sure of heaven without any of savesoul's help what is that globular l100 000 but a fast-fish what are the duke of dunder's hereditary towns and hamlets but fast-fish what to that redoubted harpooneer john bull is poor ireland but a fast-fish what to that apostolic lancer brother jonathan is texas but a fast-fish and concerning all these is not possession the whole of the law but if the doctrine of fast-fish be pretty generally applicable the kindred doctrine of loose-fish is still more widely so that is internationally and universally applicable what was america in 1492 but a loose-fish in which columbus struck the spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress what was poland to the czar what greece to the turk what india to england what at last will mexico be to the united states all loose-fish what are the rights of man and the liberties of the world but loose-fish what all men's minds and opinions but loose-fish what is the principle of religious belief in them but a loose-fish what to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but loose-fish what is the great globe itself but a loose-fish and what are you reader but a loose-fish and a fast-fish too chapter 90 heads or tails de balena vero sufficit si rex habeat caput et regina caudam bracton l 3 c 3 latin from the books of the laws of england which taken along with the context means that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land the king as honourary grand harpooneer must have the head and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail a division which in the whale is much like halving an apple there is no intermediate remainder now as this law under a modified form is to this day in force in england and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loose-fish it is here treated of in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle that prompts the english railways to be at the expense of a separate car specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty in the first place in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in force i proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years it seems that some honest mariners of dover or sandwich or some one of the cinque ports had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore now the cinque ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle called a lord warden holding the office directly from the crown i believe all the royal emoluments incident to the cinque port territories become by assignment his by some writers this office is called a sinecure but not so because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them now when these poor sun-burnt mariners bare-footed and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry promising themselves a good l150 from the precious oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives and good ale with their cronies upon the strength of their respective shares up steps a very learned and most christian and charitable gentleman with a copy of blackstone under his arm and laying it upon the whale's head he says -- hands off this fish my masters is a fast-fish i seize it as the lord warden's upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation -- so truly english -- knowing not what to say fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger but that did in nowise mend the matter or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone at length one of them after long scratching about for his ideas made bold to speak please sir who is the lord warden the duke but the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish it is his we have been at great trouble and peril and some expense and is all that to go to the duke's benefit we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters it is his is the duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood it is his i thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of this whale it is his won't the duke be content with a quarter or a half it is his in a word the whale was seized and sold and his grace the duke of wellington received the money thinking that viewed in some particular lights the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed under the circumstances a rather hard one an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration to which my lord duke in substance replied both letters were published that he had already done so and received the money and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he the reverend gentleman would decline meddling with other people's business is this the still militant old man standing at the corners of the three kingdoms on all hands coercing alms of beggars it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duke to the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign we must needs inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested with that right the law itself has already been set forth but plowdon gives us the reason for it says plowdon the whale so caught belongs to the king and queen because of its superior excellence and by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters but why should the king have the head and the queen the tail a reason for that ye lawyers in his treatise on queen-gold or queen-pinmoney an old king's bench author one william prynne thus discourseth ye tail is ye queen's that ye queen's wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or right whale was largely used in ladies' bodices but this same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like prynne but is the queen a mermaid to be presented with a tail an allegorical meaning may lurk here there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writers -- the whale and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitations and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown's ordinary revenue i know not that any other author has hinted of the matter but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality and thus there seems a reason in all things even in law chapter 91 the pequod meets the rose-bud in vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this leviathan insufferable fetor denying not inquiry sir t browne v e it was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapoury mid-day sea that the many noses on the pequod's deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea i will bet something now said stubb that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day i thought they would keel up before long presently the vapours in advance slid aside and there in the distance lay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside as we glided nearer the stranger showed french colours from his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale that is a whale that has died unmolested on the sea and so floated an unappropriated corpse it may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale worse than an assyrian city in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury the departed so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality and by no means of the nature of attar-of-rose coming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the frenchman had a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first in truth it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this however much he may shun blasted whales in general the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales there's a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in the ship's bows there's a jackal for ye i well know that these crappoes of frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery sometimes lowering their boats for breakers mistaking them for sperm whale spouts yes and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles and cases of snuffers foreseeing that all the oil they will get won't be enough to dip the captain's wick into aye we all know these things but look ye here's a crappo that is content with our leavings the drugged whale there i mean aye and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there poor devil i say pass round a hat some one and let's make him a present of a little oil for dear charity's sake for what oil he'll get from that drugged whale there wouldn't be fit to burn in a jail no not in a condemned cell and as for the other whale why i'll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than he'll get from that bundle of bones though now that i think of it it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris i wonder now if our old man has thought of that it's worth trying yes i'm for it and so saying he started for the quarter-deck by this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whether or no the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again issuing from the cabin stubb now called his boat's crew and pulled off for the stranger drawing across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french taste the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk was painted green and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour upon her head boards in large gilt letters he read bouton de rose -- rose-button or rose-bud and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship though stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscription yet the word rose and the bulbous figure-head put together sufficiently explained the whole to him a wooden rose-bud eh he cried with his hand to his nose that will do very well but how like all creation it smells now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side and thus come close to the blasted whale and so talk over it arrived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose he bawled -- bouton-de-rose ahoy are there any of you bouton-de-roses that speak english yes rejoined a guernsey-man from the bulwarks who turned out to be the chief-mate well then my bouton-de-rose-bud have you seen the white whale what whale the white whale -- a sperm whale -- moby dick have ye seen him never heard of such a whale cachalot blanche white whale -- no very good then good bye now and i'll call again in a minute then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod and seeing ahab leaning over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted -- no sir no upon which ahab retired and stubb returned to the frenchman he now perceived that the guernsey-man who had just got into the chains and was using a cutting-spade had slung his nose in a sort of bag what's the matter with your nose there said stubb broke it i wish it was broken or that i didn't have any nose at all answered the guernsey-man who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much but what are you holding yours for oh nothing it's a wax nose i have to hold it on fine day ain't it air rather gardenny i should say throw us a bunch of posies will ye bouton-de-rose what in the devil's name do you want here roared the guernseyman flying into a sudden passion oh keep cool -- cool yes that's the word why don't you pack those whales in ice while you're working at 'em but joking aside though do you know rose-bud that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales as for that dried up one there he hasn't a gill in his whole carcase i know that well enough but d'ye see the captain here won't believe it this is his first voyage he was a cologne manufacturer before but come aboard and mayhap he'll believe you if he won't me and so i'll get out of this dirty scrape anything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined stubb and with that he soon mounted to the deck there a queer scene presented itself the sailors in tasselled caps of red worsted were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales but they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor all their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-booms now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air some thinking they would catch the plague dipped oakum in coal-tar and at intervals held it to their nostrils others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke so that it constantly filled their olfactories stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the captain's round-house abaft and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajar from within this was the tormented surgeon who after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day had betaken himself to the captain's round-house cabinet he called it to avoid the pest but still could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times marking all this stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to the guernsey-man had a little chat with him during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle sounding him carefully stubb further perceived that the guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris he therefore held his peace on that head but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity according to this little plan of theirs the guernsey-man under cover of an interpreter's office was to tell the captain what he pleased but as coming from stubb and as for stubb he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin he was a small and dark but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain with large whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch-seals at his side to this gentleman stubb was now politely introduced by the guernsey-man who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them what shall i say to him first said he why said stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me though i don't pretend to be a judge he says monsieur said the guernsey-man in french turning to his captain that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captain and chief-mate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside upon this the captain started and eagerly desired to know more what now said the guernsey-man to stubb why since he takes it so easy tell him that now i have eyed him carefully i'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a whale-ship than a st jago monkey in fact tell him from me he's a baboon he vows and declares monsieur that the other whale the dried one is far more deadly than the blasted one in fine monsieur he conjures us as we value our lives to cut loose from these fish instantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship what now said the guernsey-man when the captain had returned to them why let me see yes you may as well tell him now that -- that -- in fact tell him i've diddled him and aside to himself perhaps somebody else he says monsieur that he's very happy to have been of any service to us hearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties meaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux he wants you to take a glass of wine with him said the interpreter thank him heartily but tell him it's against my principles to drink with the man i've diddled in fact tell him i must go he says monsieur that his principles won't admit of his drinking but that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink then monsieur had best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whales for it's so calm they won't drift by this time stubb was over the side and getting into his boat hailed the guernsey-man to this effect -- that having a long tow-line in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side while the frenchman's boats then were engaged in towing the ship one way stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line presently a breeze sprang up stubb feigned to cast off from the whale hoisting his boats the frenchman soon increased his distance while the pequod slid in between him and stubb's whale whereupon stubb quickly pulled to the floating body and hailing the pequod to give notice of his intentions at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning seizing his sharp boat-spade he commenced an excavation in the body a little behind the side fin you would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs it was like turning up old roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam his boat's crew were all in high excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking as anxious as gold-hunters and all the time numberless fowls were diving and ducking and screaming and yelling and fighting around them stubb was beginning to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increased when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it as one river will flow into and then along with another without at all blending with it for a time i have it i have it cried stubb with delight striking something in the subterranean regions a purse a purse dropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old cheese very unctuous and savory withal you might easily dent it with your thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour and this good friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidably lost in the sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were it not for impatient ahab's loud command to stubb to desist and come on board else the ship would bid them good bye chapter 92 ambergris now this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important as an article of commerce that in 1791 a certain nantucket-born captain coffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that subject for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day the precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem to the learned though the word ambergris is but the french compound for grey amber yet the two substances are quite distinct for amber though at times found on the sea-coast is also dug up in some far inland soils whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea besides amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance used for mouth-pieces to pipes for beads and ornaments but ambergris is soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largely used in perfumery in pastiles precious candles hair-powders and pomatum the turks use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to st peter's in rome some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret to flavor it who would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale yet so it is by some ambergris is supposed to be the cause and by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administering three or four boat loads of brandreth's pills and then running out of harm's way as laborers do in blasting rocks i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris certain hard round bony plates which at first stubb thought might be sailors' trowsers buttons but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay is this nothing bethink thee of that saying of st paul in corinthians about corruption and incorruption how that we are sown in dishonour but raised in glory and likewise call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill-savor cologne-water in its rudimental manufacturing stages is the worst i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but cannot owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen and which in the estimation of some already biased minds might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the frenchman's two whales elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly untidy business but there is another thing to rebut they hint that all whales always smell bad now how did this odious stigma originate i opine that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the greenland whaling ships in london more than two centuries ago because those whalemen did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea as the southern ships have always done but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits thrust it through the bung holes of large casks and carry it home in that manner the shortness of the season in those icy seas and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed forbidding any other course the consequence is that upon breaking into the hold and unloading one of these whale cemeteries in the greenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard for the foundations of a lying-in-hospital i partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in former times of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack in his great work on smells a text-book on that subject as its name imports smeer fat berg to put up this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out without being taken home to holland for that purpose it was a collection of furnaces fat-kettles and oil sheds and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor but all this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler which in a voyage of four years perhaps after completely filling her hold with oil does not perhaps consume fifty days in the business of boiling out and in the state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless the truth is that living or dead if but decently treated whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognised as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a jew in the company by the nose nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant when as a general thing he enjoys such high health taking abundance of exercise always out of doors though it is true seldom in the open air i say that the motion of a sperm whale's flukes above water dispenses a perfume as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance considering his magnitude must it not be to that famous elephant with jewelled tusks and redolent with myrrh which was led out of an indian town to do honour to alexander the great chapter 93 the castaway it was but some few days after encountering the frenchman that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the pequod's crew an event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own now in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale as a general thing these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats' crews but if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nick-name pip by abbreviation poor pip ye have heard of him before ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight so gloomy-jolly in outer aspect pip and dough-boy made a match like a black pony and a white one of equal developments though of dissimilar colour driven in one eccentric span but while hapless dough-boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects pip though over tender-hearted was at bottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer freer relish than any other race for blacks the year's calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five fourth of julys and new year's days nor smile so while i write that this little black was brilliant for even blackness has its brilliancy behold yon lustrous ebony panelled in king's cabinets but pip loved life and all life's peaceable securities so that the panic-striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped had most sadly blurred his brightness though as ere long will be seen what was thus temporarily subdued in him in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tolland county in connecticut he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the green and at melodious even-tide with his gay ha-ha had turned the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine so though in the clear air of day suspended against a blue-veined neck the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre he lays it against a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some unnatural gases then come out those fiery effulgences infernally superb then the evil-blazing diamond once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies looks like some crown-jewel stolen from the king of hell but let us to the story it came to pass that in the ambergris affair stubb's after-oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand as for a time to become quite maimed and temporarily pip was put into his place the first time stubb lowered with him pip evinced much nervousness but happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale and therefore came off not altogether discreditably though stubb observing him took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost for he might often find it needful now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and as the fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap which happened in this instance to be right under poor pip's seat the involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so as to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water that instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the line swiftly straightened and presto poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken several turns around his chest and neck tashtego stood in the bows he was full of the fire of the hunt he hated pip for a poltroon snatching the boat-knife from its sheath he suspended its sharp edge over the line and turning towards stubb exclaimed interrogatively cut meantime pip's blue choked face plainly looked do for god's sake all passed in a flash in less than half a minute this entire thing happened damn him cut roared stubb and so the whale was lost and pip was saved so soon as he recovered himself the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate stubb then in a plain business-like but still half humorous manner cursed pip officially and that done unofficially gave him much wholesome advice the substance was never jump from a boat pip except -- but all the rest was indefinite as the soundest advice ever is now in general stick to the boat is your true motto in whaling but cases will sometimes happen when leap from the boat is still better moreover as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenly dropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command stick to the boat pip or by the lord i won't pick you up if you jump mind that we can't afford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would sell for thirty times what you would pip in alabama bear that in mind and don't jump any more hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted that though man loved his fellow yet man is a money-making animal which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence but we are all in the hands of the gods and pip jumped again it was under very similar circumstances to the first performance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale started to run pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried traveller's trunk alas stubb was but too true to his word it was a beautiful bounteous blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and flatly stretching away all round to the horizon like gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremest bobbing up and down in that sea pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves no boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern stubb's inexorable back was turned upon him and the whale was winged in three minutes a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between pip and stubb out from the centre of the sea poor pip turned his crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though the loftiest and the brightest now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable the intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity my god who can tell it mark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea -- mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate no he did not mean to at least because there were two boats in his wake and he supposed no doubt that they would of course come up to pip very quickly and pick him up though indeed such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances and such instances not unfrequently occur almost invariably in the fishery a coward so called is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies but it so happened that those boats without seeing pip suddenly spying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and stubb's boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish that pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such at least they said he was the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up but drowned the infinite of his soul not drowned entirely though rather carried down alive to wondrous depths where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes and the miser-merman wisdom revealed his hoarded heaps and among the joyous heartless ever-juvenile eternities pip saw the multitudinous god-omnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs he saw god's foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad so man's insanity is heaven's sense and wandering from all mortal reason man comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromised indifferent as his god for the rest blame not stubb too hardly the thing is common in that fishery and in the sequel of the narrative it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself chapter 94 a squeeze of the hand that whale of stubb's so dearly purchased was duly brought to the pequod's side where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun or case while some were occupied with this latter duty others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs so soon as filled with the sperm and when the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the try-works of which anon it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when with several others i sat down before a large constantine's bath of it i found it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling about in the liquid part it was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid a sweet and unctuous duty no wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic such a clearer such a sweetener such a softener such a delicious molifier after having my hands in it for only a few minutes my fingers felt like eels and began as it were to serpentine and spiralise as i sat there at my ease cross-legged on the deck after the bitter exertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under indolent sail and gliding so serenely along as i bathed my hands among those soft gentle globules of infiltrated tissues woven almost within the hour as they richly broke to my fingers and discharged all their opulence like fully ripe grapes their wine as i snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma -- literally and truly like the smell of spring violets i declare to you that for the time i lived as in a musky meadow i forgot all about our horrible oath in that inexpressible sperm i washed my hands and my heart of it i almost began to credit the old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger while bathing in that bath i felt divinely free from all ill-will or petulance or malice of any sort whatsoever squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long i squeezed that sperm till i myself almost melted into it i squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me and i found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers' hands in it mistaking their hands for the gentle globules such an abounding affectionate friendly loving feeling did this avocation beget that at last i was continually squeezing their hands and looking up into their eyes sentimentally as much as to say -- oh my dear fellow beings why should we longer cherish any social acerbities or know the slightest ill-humor or envy come let us squeeze hands all round nay let us all squeeze ourselves into each other let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever for now since by many prolonged repeated experiences i have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable felicity not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the fireside the country now that i have perceived all this i am ready to squeeze case eternally in thoughts of the visions of the night i saw long rows of angels in paradise each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti now while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things akin to it in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try-works first comes white-horse so called which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish and also from the thicker portions of his flukes it is tough with congealed tendons -- a wad of muscle -- but still contains some oil after being severed from the whale the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer they look much like blocks of berkshire marble plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale's flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness it is a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold as its name imports it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple it is plums of rubies in pictures of citron spite of reason it is hard to keep yourself from eating it i confess that once i stole behind the foremast to try it it tasted something as i should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have tasted supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagne there is another substance and a very singular one which turns up in the course of this business but which i feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe it is called slobgollion an appellation original with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substance it is an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently found in the tubs of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting i hold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membranes of the case coalescing gurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen it designates the dark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the greenland or right whale and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan nippers strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale's vocabulary but as applied by whalemen it becomes so a whaleman's nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of leviathan's tail it averages an inch in thickness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewise moved along the oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and by nameless blandishments as of magic allures along with it all impurities but to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is at once to descend into the blubber-room and have a long talk with its inmates this place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket-pieces when stript and hoisted from the whale when the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros especially by night on one side lit by a dull lantern a space has been left clear for the workmen they generally go in pairs -- a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man the whaling-pike is similar to a frigate's boarding-weapon of the same name the gaff is something like a boat-hook with his gaff the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber and strives to hold it from slipping as the ship pitches and lurches about meanwhile the spade-man stands on the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces this spade is sharp as hone can make it the spademan's feet are shoeless the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him like a sledge if he cuts off one of his own toes or one of his assistants' would you be very much astonished toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men chapter 95 the cassock had you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of this post-mortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would have seen there lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers not the wondrous cistern in the whale's huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so surprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone -- longer than a kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jet-black as yojo the ebony idol of queequeg and an idol indeed it is or rather in old times its likeness was such an idol as that found in the secret groves of queen maachah in judea and for worshipping which king asa her son did depose her and destroyed the idol and burnt it for an abomination at the brook kedron as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the first book of kings look at the sailor called the mincer who now comes along and assisted by two allies heavily backs the grandissimus as the mariners call it and with bowed shoulders staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field extending it upon the forecastle deck he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt as an african hunter the pelt of a boa this done he turns the pelt inside out like a pantaloon leg gives it a good stretching so as almost to double its diameter and at last hangs it well spread in the rigging to dry ere long it is taken down when removing some three feet of it towards the pointed extremity and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it the mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling immemorial to all his order this investiture alone will adequately protect him while employed in the peculiar functions of his office that office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the pots an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse planted endwise against the bulwarks and with a capacious tub beneath it into which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheets from a rapt orator's desk arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaves what a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a pope were this mincer bible leaves bible leaves this is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer it enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into as thin slices as possible inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated and its quantity considerably increased besides perhaps improving it in quality chapter 96 the try-works besides her hoisted boats an american whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try-works she presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship it is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were transported to her planks the try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast the most roomy part of the deck the timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar some ten feet by eight square and five in height the foundation does not penetrate the deck but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides and screwing it down to the timbers on the flanks it is cased with wood and at top completely covered by a large sloping battened hatchway removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots two in number and each of several barrels' capacity when not in use they are kept remarkably clean sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand till they shine within like silver punch-bowls during the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap while employed in polishing them -- one man in each pot side by side -- many confidential communications are carried on over the iron lips it is a place also for profound mathematical meditation it was in the left hand try-pot of the pequod with the soapstone diligently circling round me that i was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid my soapstone for example will descend from any point in precisely the same time removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works the bare masonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces directly underneath the pots these mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron the intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works by a tunnel inserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates there are no external chimneys they open direct from the rear wall and here let us go back for a moment it was about nine o'clock at night that the pequod's try-works were first started on this present voyage it belonged to stubb to oversee the business all ready there off hatch then and start her you cook fire the works this was an easy thing for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed for a time with wood after that no wood is used except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel in a word after being tried out the crisp shrivelled blubber now called scraps or fritters still contains considerable of its unctuous properties these fritters feed the flames like a plethoric burning martyr or a self-consuming misanthrope once ignited the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body would that he consumed his own smoke for his smoke is horrible to inhale and inhale it you must and not only that but you must live in it for the time it has an unspeakable wild hindoo odor about it such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres it smells like the left wing of the day of judgment it is an argument for the pit by midnight the works were in full operation we were clear from the carcase sail had been made the wind was freshening the wild ocean darkness was intense but that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed greek fire the burning ship drove on as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed so the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the bold hydriote canaris issuing from their midnight harbors with broad sheets of flame for sails bore down upon the turkish frigates and folded them in conflagrations the hatch removed from the top of the works now afforded a wide hearth in front of them standing on this were the tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers always the whale-ship's stokers with huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots or stirred up the fires beneath till the snaky flames darted curling out of the doors to catch them by the feet the smoke rolled away in sullen heaps to every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces opposite the mouth of the works on the further side of the wide wooden hearth was the windlass this served for a sea-sofa here lounged the watch when not otherwise employed looking into the red heat of the fire till their eyes felt scorched in their heads their tawny features now all begrimed with smoke and sweat their matted beards and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works as they narrated to each other their unholy adventures their tales of terror told in words of mirth as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them like the flames from the furnace as to and fro in their front the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth and viciously spat round her on all sides then the rushing pequod freighted with savages and laden with fire and burning a corpse and plunging into that blackness of darkness seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander's soul so seemed it to me as i stood at her helm and for long hours silently guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea wrapped for that interval in darkness myself i but the better saw the redness the madness the ghastliness of others the continual sight of the fiend shapes before me capering half in smoke and half in fire these at last begat kindred visions in my soul so soon as i began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm but that night in particular a strange and ever since inexplicable thing occurred to me starting from a brief standing sleep i was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong the jaw-bone tiller smote my side which leaned against it in my ears was the low hum of sails just beginning to shake in the wind i thought my eyes were open i was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart but spite of all this i could see no compass before me to steer by though it seemed but a minute since i had been watching the card by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness uppermost was the impression that whatever swift rushing thing i stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern a stark bewildered feeling as of death came over me convulsively my hands grasped the tiller but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was somehow in some enchanted way inverted my god what is the matter with me thought i lo in my brief sleep i had turned myself about and was fronting the ship's stern with my back to her prow and the compass in an instant i faced back just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind and very probably capsizing her how glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee look not too long in the face of the fire o man never dream with thy hand on the helm turn not thy back to the compass accept the first hint of the hitching tiller believe not the artificial fire when its redness makes all things look ghastly to-morrow in the natural sun the skies will be bright those who glared like devils in the forking flames the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief the glorious golden glad sun the only true lamp -- all others but liars nevertheless the sun hides not virginia's dismal swamp nor rome's accursed campagna nor wide sahara nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon the sun hides not the ocean which is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds of this earth so therefore that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him that mortal man cannot be true -- not true or undeveloped with books the same the truest of all men was the man of sorrows and the truest of all books is solomon's and ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe all is vanity all this wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian solomon's wisdom yet but he who dodges hospitals and jails and walks fast crossing graveyards and would rather talk of operas than hell calls cowper young pascal rousseau poor devils all of sick men and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by rabelais as passing wise and therefore jolly -- not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb-stones and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous solomon but even solomon he says the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain i e even while living in the congregation of the dead give not thyself up then to fire lest it invert thee deaden thee as for the time it did me there is a wisdom that is woe but there is a woe that is madness and there is a catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces and even if he for ever flies within the gorge that gorge is in the mountains so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain even though they soar chapter 97 the lamp had you descended from the pequod's try-works to the pequod's forecastle where the off duty watch were sleeping for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors there they lay in their triangular oaken vaults each mariner a chiselled muteness a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes in merchantmen oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens to dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble in darkness to his pallet this is his usual lot but the whaleman as he seeks the food of light so he lives in light he makes his berth an aladdin's lamp and lays him down in it so that in the pitchiest night the ship's black hull still houses an illumination see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps -- often but old bottles and vials though -- to the copper cooler at the try-works and replenishes them there as mugs of ale at a vat he burns too the purest of oil in its unmanufactured and therefore unvitiated state a fluid unknown to solar lunar or astral contrivances ashore it is sweet as early grass butter in april he goes and hunts for his oil so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game chapter 98 stowing down and clearing up already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the mast-head how he is chased over the watery moors and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep how he is then towed alongside and beheaded and how on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner how in due time he is condemned to the pots and like shadrach meshach and abednego his spermaceti oil and bone pass unscathed through the fire -- but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing -- singing if i may -- the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities sliding along beneath the surface as before but alas never more to rise and blow while still warm the oil like hot punch is received into the six-barrel casks and while perhaps the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over end for end and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck like so many land slides till at last man-handled and stayed in their course and all round the hoops rap rap go as many hammers as can play upon them for now ex officio every sailor is a cooper at length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then the great hatchways are unsealed the bowels of the ship are thrown open and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea this done the hatches are replaced and hermetically closed like a closet walled up in the sperm fishery this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in all the business of whaling one day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale's head are profanely piled great rusty casks lie about as in a brewery yard the smoke from the try-works has besooted all the bulwarks the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness the entire ship seems great leviathan himself while on all hands the din is deafening but a day or two after you look about you and prick your ears in this self-same ship and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel with a most scrupulously neat commander the unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue this is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil besides from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale a potent lye is readily made and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side that lye quickly exterminates it hands go diligently along the bulwarks and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness the soot is brushed from the lower rigging all the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away the great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works completely hiding the pots every cask is out of sight all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship's company the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions shift themselves from top to toe and finally issue to the immaculate deck fresh and all aglow as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest holland now with elated step they pace the planks in twos and threes and humorously discourse of parlors sofas carpets and fine cambrics propose to mat the deck think of having hanging to the top object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle to hint to such musked mariners of oil and bone and blubber were little short of audacity they know not the thing you distantly allude to away and bring us napkins but mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand three men intent on spying out more whales which if caught infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture and drop at least one small grease-spot somewhere yes and many is the time when after the severest uninterrupted labors which know no night continuing straight through for ninety-six hours when from the boat where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the line -- they only step to the deck to carry vast chains and heave the heavy windlass and cut and slash yea and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works when on the heel of all this they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship and make a spotless dairy room of it many is the time the poor fellows just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks are startled by the cry of there she blows and away they fly to fight another whale and go through the whole weary thing again oh my friends but this is man-killing yet this is life for hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this world's vast bulk its small but valuable sperm and then with weary patience cleansed ourselves from its defilements and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul hardly is this done when -- there she blows -- the ghost is spouted up and away we sail to fight some other world and go through young life's old routine again oh the metempsychosis oh pythagoras that in bright greece two thousand years ago did die so good so wise so mild i sailed with thee along the peruvian coast last voyage -- and foolish as i am taught thee a green simple boy how to splice a rope chapter 99 the doubloon ere now it has been related how ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck taking regular turns at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks when most plunged in his mood he was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him when he halted before the binnacle with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast then as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness only dashed with a certain wild longing if not hopefulness but one morning turning to pass the doubloon he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them and some certain significance lurks in all things else all things are little worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher except to sell by the cartload as they do hills about boston to fill up some morass in the milky way now this doubloon was of purest virgin gold raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills whence east and west over golden sands the head-waters of many a pactolus flows and though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes yet untouchable and immaculate to any foulness it still preserved its quito glow nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last for it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end and however wanton in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it as the white whale's talisman sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night wondering whose it was to be at last and whether he would ever live to spend it now those noble golden coins of south america are as medals of the sun and tropic token-pieces here palms alpacas and volcanoes sun's disks and stars ecliptics horns-of-plenty and rich banners waving are in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by passing through those fancy mints so spanishly poetic it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod was a most wealthy example of these things on its round border it bore the letters republica del ecuador quito so this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world and beneath the great equator and named after it and it had been cast midway up the andes in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three andes' summits from one a flame a tower on another on the third a crowing cock while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at libra before this equatorial coin ahab not unobserved by others was now pausing there's something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers and all other grand and lofty things look here -- three peaks as proud as lucifer the firm tower that is ahab the volcano that is ahab the courageous the undaunted and victorious fowl that too is ahab all are ahab and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe which like a magician's glass to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self great pains small gains for those who ask the world to solve them it cannot solve itself methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face but see aye he enters the sign of storms the equinox and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at aries from storm to storm so be it then born in throes 't is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs so be it then here's stout stuff for woe to work on so be it then no fairy fingers can have pressed the gold but devil's claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday murmured starbuck to himself leaning against the bulwarks the old man seems to read belshazzar's awful writing i have never marked the coin inspectingly he goes below let me read a dark valley between three mighty heaven-abiding peaks that almost seem the trinity in some faint earthly symbol so in this vale of death god girds us round and over all our gloom the sun of righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope if we bend down our eyes the dark vale shows her mouldy soil but if we lift them the bright sun meets our glance half way to cheer yet oh the great sun is no fixture and if at midnight we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him we gaze for him in vain this coin speaks wisely mildly truly but still sadly to me i will quit it lest truth shake me falsely there now's the old mogul soliloquized stubb by the try-works he's been twigging it and there goes starbuck from the same and both with faces which i should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long and all from looking at a piece of gold which did i have it now on negro hill or in corlaer's hook i'd not look at it very long ere spending it humph in my poor insignificant opinion i regard this as queer i have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings your doubloons of old spain your doubloons of peru your doubloons of chili your doubloons of bolivia your doubloons of popayan with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles and joes and half joes and quarter joes what then should there be in this doubloon of the equator that is so killing wonderful by golconda let me read it once halloa here's signs and wonders truly that now is what old bowditch in his epitome calls the zodiac and what my almanac below calls ditto i'll get the almanac and as i have heard devils can be raised with daboll's arithmetic i'll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the massachusetts calendar here's the book let's see now signs and wonders and the sun he's always among 'em hem hem hem here they are -- here they go -- all alive -- aries or the ram taurus or the bull and jimimi here's gemini himself or the twins well the sun he wheels among 'em aye here on the coin he's just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring book you lie there the fact is you books must know your places you'll do to give us the bare words and facts but we come in to supply the thoughts that's my small experience so far as the massachusetts calendar and bowditch's navigator and daboll's arithmetic go signs and wonders eh pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs and significant in wonders there's a clue somewhere wait a bit hist -- hark by jove i have it look you doubloon your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter and now i'll read it off straight out of the book come almanack to begin there's aries or the ram -- lecherous dog he begets us then taurus or the bull -- he bumps us the first thing then gemini or the twins -- that is virtue and vice we try to reach virtue when lo comes cancer the crab and drags us back and here going from virtue leo a roaring lion lies in the path -- he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw we escape and hail virgo the virgin that's our first love we marry and think to be happy for aye when pop comes libra or the scales -- happiness weighed and found wanting and while we are very sad about that lord how we suddenly jump as scorpio or the scorpion stings us in the rear we are curing the wound when whang come the arrows all round sagittarius or the archer is amusing himself as we pluck out the shafts stand aside here's the battering-ram capricornus or the goat full tilt he comes rushing and headlong we are tossed when aquarius or the water-bearer pours out his whole deluge and drowns us and to wind up with pisces or the fishes we sleep there's a sermon now writ in high heaven and the sun goes through it every year and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty jollily he aloft there wheels through toil and trouble and so alow here does jolly stubb oh jolly's the word for aye adieu doubloon but stop here comes little king-post dodge round the try-works now and let's hear what he'll have to say there he's before it he'll out with something presently so so he's beginning i see nothing here but a round thing made of gold and whoever raises a certain whale this round thing belongs to him so what's all this staring been about it is worth sixteen dollars that's true and at two cents the cigar that's nine hundred and sixty cigars i won't smoke dirty pipes like stubb but i like cigars and here's nine hundred and sixty of them so here goes flask aloft to spy 'em out shall i call that wise or foolish now if it be really wise it has a foolish look to it yet if it be really foolish then has it a sort of wiseish look to it but avast here comes our old manxman -- the old hearse-driver he must have been that is before he took to the sea he luffs up before the doubloon halloa and goes round on the other side of the mast why there's a horse-shoe nailed on that side and now he's back again what does that mean hark he's muttering -- voice like an old worn-out coffee-mill prick ears and listen if the white whale be raised it must be in a month and a day when the sun stands in some one of these signs i've studied signs and know their marks they were taught me two score years ago by the old witch in copenhagen now in what sign will the sun then be the horse-shoe sign for there it is right opposite the gold and what's the horse-shoe sign the lion is the horse-shoe sign -- the roaring and devouring lion ship old ship my old head shakes to think of thee there's another rendering now but still one text all sorts of men in one kind of world you see dodge again here comes queequeg -- all tattooing -- looks like the signs of the zodiac himself what says the cannibal as i live he's comparing notes looking at his thigh bone thinks the sun is in the thigh or in the calf or in the bowels i suppose as the old women talk surgeon's astronomy in the back country and by jove he's found something there in the vicinity of his thigh -- i guess it's sagittarius or the archer no he don't know what to make of the doubloon he takes it for an old button off some king's trowsers but aside again here comes that ghost-devil fedallah tail coiled out of sight as usual oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual what does he say with that look of his ah only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself there is a sun on the coin -- fire worshipper depend upon it ho more and more this way comes pip -- poor boy would he had died or i he's half horrible to me he too has been watching all of these interpreters -- myself included -- and look now he comes to read with that unearthly idiot face stand away again and hear him hark i look you look he looks we look ye look they look upon my soul he's been studying murray's grammar improving his mind poor fellow but what's that he says now -- hist i look you look he looks we look ye look they look why he's getting it by heart -- hist again i look you look he looks we look ye look they look well that's funny and i you and he and we ye and they are all bats and i'm a crow especially when i stand a'top of this pine tree here caw caw caw caw caw caw ain't i a crow and where's the scare-crow there he stands two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket wonder if he means me -- complimentary -- poor lad -- i could go hang myself any way for the present i'll quit pip's vicinity i can stand the rest for they have plain wits but he's too crazy-witty for my sanity so so i leave him muttering here's the ship's navel this doubloon here and they are all on fire to unscrew it but unscrew your navel and what's the consequence then again if it stays here that is ugly too for when aught's nailed to the mast it's a sign that things grow desperate ha ha old ahab the white whale he'll nail ye this is a pine tree my father in old tolland county cut down a pine tree once and found a silver ring grown over in it some old darkey's wedding ring how did it get there and so they'll say in the resurrection when they come to fish up this old mast and find a doubloon lodged in it with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark oh the gold the precious precious gold the green miser'll hoard ye soon hish hish god goes 'mong the worlds blackberrying cook ho cook and cook us jenny hey hey hey hey hey jenny jenny and get your hoe-cake done chapter 100 leg and arm the pequod of nantucket meets the samuel enderby of london ship ahoy hast seen the white whale so cried ahab once more hailing a ship showing english colours bearing down under the stern trumpet to mouth the old man was standing in his hoisted quarter-boat his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain who was carelessly reclining in his own boat's bow he was a darkly-tanned burly good-natured fine-looking man of sixty or thereabouts dressed in a spacious roundabout that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar's surcoat hast seen the white whale see you this and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminating in a wooden head like a mallet man my boat cried ahab impetuously and tossing about the oars near him -- stand by to lower in less than a minute without quitting his little craft he and his crew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of the stranger but here a curious difficulty presented itself in the excitement of the moment ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the pequod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's warning now it is no very easy matter for anybody -- except those who are almost hourly used to it like whalemen -- to clamber up a ship's side from a boat on the open sea for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson so deprived of one leg and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain it has before been hinted perhaps that every little untoward circumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab and in the present instance all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship leaning over the side by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters but this awkwardness only lasted a minute because the strange captain observing at a glance how affairs stood cried out i see i see -- avast heaving there jump boys and swing over the cutting-tackle as good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous and the great tackles were still aloft and the massive curved blubber-hook now clean and dry was still attached to the end this was quickly lowered to ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks and gently landed upon the capstan head with his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome the other captain advanced and ahab putting out his ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm like two sword-fish blades cried out in his walrus way aye aye hearty let us shake bones together -- an arm and a leg -- an arm that never can shrink d'ye see and a leg that never can run where did'st thou see the white whale -- how long ago the white whale said the englishman pointing his ivory arm towards the east and taking a rueful sight along it as if it had been a telescope there i saw him on the line last season and he took that arm off did he asked ahab now sliding down from the capstan and resting on the englishman's shoulder as he did so aye he was the cause of it at least and that leg too spin me the yarn said ahab how was it it was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line began the englishman i was ignorant of the white whale at that time well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales and my boat fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was too that went milling and milling round so that my boat's crew could only trim dish by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale with a milky-white head and hump all crows' feet and wrinkles it was he it was he cried ahab suddenly letting out his suspended breath and harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin aye aye -- they were mine -- my irons cried ahab exultingly -- but on give me a chance then said the englishman good-humoredly well this old great-grandfather with the white head and hump runs all afoam into the pod and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line aye i see -- wanted to part it free the fast-fish -- an old trick -- i know him how it was exactly continued the one-armed commander i do not know but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught there somehow but we didn't know it then so that when we afterwards pulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the other whale's that went off to windward all fluking seeing how matters stood and what a noble great whale it was -- the noblest and biggest i ever saw sir in my life -- i resolved to capture him spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in and thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose or the tooth it was tangled to might draw for i have a devil of a boat's crew for a pull on a whale-line seeing all this i say i jumped into my first mate's boat -- mr mounttop's here by the way captain -- mounttop mounttop -- the captain -- as i was saying i jumped into mounttop's boat which d'ye see was gunwale and gunwale with mine then and snatching the first harpoon let this old great-grandfather have it but lord look you sir -- hearts and souls alive man -- the next instant in a jiff i was blind as a bat -- both eyes out -- all befogged and bedeadened with black foam -- the whale's tail looming straight up out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble steeple no use sterning all then but as i was groping at midday with a blinding sun all crown-jewels as i was groping i say after the second iron to toss it overboard -- down comes the tail like a lima tower cutting my boat in two leaving each half in splinters and flukes first the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was all chips we all struck out to escape his terrible flailings i seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish but a combing sea dashed me off and at the same instant the fish taking one good dart forwards went down like a flash and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here clapping his hand just below his shoulder yes caught me just here i say and bore me down to hell's flames i was thinking when when all of a sudden thank the good god the barb ript its way along the flesh -- clear along the whole length of my arm -- came out nigh my wrist and up i floated -- and that gentleman there will tell you the rest by the way captain -- dr bunger ship's surgeon bunger my lad -- the captain now bunger boy spin your part of the yarn the professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out had been all the time standing near them with nothing specific visible to denote his gentlemanly rank on board his face was an exceedingly round but sober one he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt and patched trowsers and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand and a pill-box held in the other occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains but at his superior's introduction of him to ahab he politely bowed and straightway went on to do his captain's bidding it was a shocking bad wound began the whale-surgeon and taking my advice captain boomer here stood our old sammy -- samuel enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the one-armed captain addressing ahab go on boy stood our old sammy off to the northward to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the line but it was no use -- i did all i could sat up with him nights was very severe with him in the matter of diet -- oh very severe chimed in the patient himself then suddenly altering his voice drinking hot rum toddies with me every night till he couldn't see to put on the bandages and sending me to bed half seas over about three o'clock in the morning oh ye stars he sat up with me indeed and was very severe in my diet oh a great watcher and very dietetically severe is dr bunger bunger you dog laugh out why don't ye you know you're a precious jolly rascal but heave ahead boy i'd rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man my captain you must have ere this perceived respected sir -- said the imperturbable godly-looking bunger slightly bowing to ahab -- is apt to be facetious at times he spins us many clever things of that sort but i may as well say -- en passant as the french remark -- that i myself -- that is to say jack bunger late of the reverend clergy -- am a strict total abstinence man i never drink -- water cried the captain he never drinks it it's a sort of fits to him fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia but go on -- go on with the arm story yes i may as well said the surgeon coolly i was about observing sir before captain boomer's facetious interruption that spite of my best and severest endeavors the wound kept getting worse and worse the truth was sir it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw more than two feet and several inches long i measured it with the lead line in short it grew black i knew what was threatened and off it came but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there that thing is against all rule -- pointing at it with the marlingspike -- that is the captain's work not mine he ordered the carpenter to make it he had that club-hammer there put to the end to knock some one's brains out with i suppose as he tried mine once he flies into diabolical passions sometimes do ye see this dent sir -- removing his hat and brushing aside his hair and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull but which bore not the slightest scarry trace or any token of ever having been a wound -- well the captain there will tell you how that came here he knows no i don't said the captain but his mother did he was born with it oh you solemn rogue you -- you bunger was there ever such another bunger in the watery world bunger when you die you ought to die in pickle you dog you should be preserved to future ages you rascal what became of the white whale now cried ahab who thus far had been impatiently listening to this by-play between the two englishmen oh cried the one-armed captain oh yes well after he sounded we didn't see him again for some time in fact as i before hinted i didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick till some time afterwards when coming back to the line we heard about moby dick -- as some call him -- and then i knew it was he did'st thou cross his wake again twice but could not fasten didn't want to try to ain't one limb enough what should i do without this other arm and i'm thinking moby dick doesn't bite so much as he swallows well then interrupted bunger give him your left arm for bait to get the right do you know gentlemen -- very gravely and mathematically bowing to each captain in succession -- do you know gentlemen that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine providence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man's arm and he knows it too so that what you take for the white whale's malice is only his awkwardness for he never means to swallow a single limb he only thinks to terrify by feints but sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient of mine in ceylon that making believe swallow jack-knives once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more when i gave him an emetic and he heaved it up in small tacks d'ye see no possible way for him to digest that jack-knife and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system yes captain boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other why in that case the arm is yours only let the whale have another chance at you shortly that's all no thank ye bunger said the english captain he's welcome to the arm he has since i can't help it and didn't know him then but not to another one no more white whales for me i've lowered for him once and that has satisfied me there would be great glory in killing him i know that and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him but hark ye he's best let alone don't you think so captain -- glancing at the ivory leg he is but he will still be hunted for all that what is best let alone that accursed thing is not always what least allures he's all a magnet how long since thou saw'st him last which way heading bless my soul and curse the foul fiend's cried bunger stoopingly walking round ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing this man's blood -- bring the thermometer -- it's at the boiling point -- his pulse makes these planks beat -- sir -- taking a lancet from his pocket and drawing near to ahab's arm avast roared ahab dashing him against the bulwarks -- man the boat which way heading good god cried the english captain to whom the question was put what's the matter he was heading east i think -- is your captain crazy whispering fedallah but fedallah putting a finger on his lip slid over the bulwarks to take the boat's steering oar and ahab swinging the cutting-tackle towards him commanded the ship's sailors to stand by to lower in a moment he was standing in the boat's stern and the manilla men were springing to their oars in vain the english captain hailed him with back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod chapter 101 the decanter ere the english ship fades from sight be it set down here that she hailed from london and was named after the late samuel enderby merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of enderby sons a house which in my poor whaleman's opinion comes not far behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons in point of real historical interest how long prior to the year of our lord 1775 this great whaling house was in existence my numerous fish-documents do not make plain but in that year 1775 it fitted out the first english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale though for some score of years previous ever since 1726 our valiant coffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleets pursued that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not elsewhere be it distinctly recorded here that the nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him in 1778 a fine ship the amelia fitted out for the express purpose and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly rounded cape horn and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the great south sea the voyage was a skilful and lucky one and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm the amelia's example was soon followed by other ships english and american and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific were thrown open but not content with this good deed the indefatigable house again bestirred itself samuel and all his sons -- how many their mother only knows -- and under their immediate auspices and partly i think at their expense the british government was induced to send the sloop-of-war rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea commanded by a naval post-captain the rattler made a rattling voyage of it and did some service how much does not appear but this is not all in 1819 the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan that ship -- well called the syren -- made a noble experimental cruise and it was thus that the great japanese whaling ground first became generally known the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a captain coffin a nantucketer all honour to the enderbies therefore whose house i think exists to the present day though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world the ship named after him was worthy of the honour being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way i boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the patagonian coast and drank good flip down in the forecastle it was a fine gam we had and they were all trumps -- every soul on board a short life to them and a jolly death and that fine gam i had -- long very long after old ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel -- it minds me of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that ship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if i ever lose sight of it flip did i say we had flip yes and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour and when the squall came for it's squally off there by patagonia and all hands -- visitors and all -- were called to reef topsails we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the howling gale a warning example to all drunken tars however the masts did not go overboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober that we had to pass the flip again though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste the beef was fine -- tough but with body in it they said it was bull-beef others that it was dromedary beef but i do not know for certain how that was they had dumplings too small but substantial symmetrically globular and indestructible dumplings i fancied that you could feel them and roll them about in you after they were swallowed if you stooped over too far forward you risked their pitching out of you like billiard-balls the bread -- but that couldn't be helped besides it was an anti-scorbutic in short the bread contained the only fresh fare they had but the forecastle was not very light and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it but all in all taking her from truck to helm considering the dimensions of the cook's boilers including his own live parchment boilers fore and aft i say the samuel enderby was a jolly ship of good fare and plenty fine flip and strong crack fellows all and capital from boot heels to hat-band but why was it think ye that the samuel enderby and some other english whalers i know of -- not all though -- were such famous hospitable ships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing i will tell you the abounding good cheer of these english whalers is matter for historical research nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale research when it has seemed needed the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders zealanders and danes from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashions touching plenty to eat and drink for as a general thing the english merchant-ship scrimps her crew but not so the english whaler hence in the english this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special origin which is here pointed out and will be still further elucidated during my researches in the leviathanic histories i stumbled upon an ancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it i knew must be about whalers the title was dan coopman wherefore i concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam cooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry its cooper i was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one fitz swackhammer but my friend dr snodhead a very learned man professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and st pott's to whom i handed the work for translation giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble -- this same dr snodhead so soon as he spied the book assured me that dan coopman did not mean the cooper but the merchant in short this ancient and learned low dutch book treated of the commerce of holland and among other subjects contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery and in this chapter it was headed smeer or fat that i found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of dutch whalemen from which list as translated by dr snodhead i transcribe the following 400 000 lbs of beef 60 000 lbs friesland pork 150 000 lbs of stock fish 550 000 lbs of biscuit 72 000 lbs of soft bread 2 800 firkins of butter 20 000 lbs texel leyden cheese 144 000 lbs cheese probably an inferior article 550 ankers of geneva 10 800 barrels of beer most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading not so in the present case however where the reader is flooded with whole pipes barrels quarts and gills of good gin and good cheer at the time i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer beef and bread during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me capable of a transcendental and platonic application and furthermore i compiled supplementary tables of my own touching the probable quantity of stock-fish etc consumed by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen whale fishery in the first place the amount of butter and texel and leyden cheese consumed seems amazing i impute it though to their naturally unctuous natures being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar seas on the very coasts of that esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil the quantity of beer too is very large 10 800 barrels now as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea did not much exceed three months say and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail we have 5 400 low dutch seamen in all therefore i say we have precisely two barrels of beer per man for a twelve weeks' allowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin now whether these gin and beer harpooneers so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat's head and take good aim at flying whales this would seem somewhat improbable yet they did aim at them and hit them too but this was very far north be it remembered where beer agrees well with the constitution upon the equator in our southern fishery beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford but no more enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers and that the english whalers have not neglected so excellent an example for say they when cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out of the world get a good dinner out of it at least and this empties the decanter chapter 102 a bower in the arsacides hitherto in descriptively treating of the sperm whale i have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features but to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him it behooves me now to unbutton him still further and untagging the points of his hose unbuckling his garters and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones set him before you in his ultimatum that is to say in his unconditional skeleton but how now ishmael how is it that you a mere oarsman in the fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lectures on the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a specimen rib for exhibition explain thyself ishmael can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for examination as a cook dishes a roast-pig surely not a veritable witness have you hitherto been ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams the rafters ridge-pole sleepers and under-pinnings making up the frame-work of leviathan and belike of the tallow-vats dairy-rooms butteries and cheeseries in his bowels i confess that since jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless i have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature in a ship i belonged to a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons and for the heads of the lances think you i let that chance go without using my boat-hatchet and jack-knife and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub and as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge i am indebted to my late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides for being at tranque years ago when attached to the trading-ship dey of algiers i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays with the lord of tranque at his retired palm villa at pupella a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our sailors called bamboo-town his capital among many other fine qualities my royal friend tranquo being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu had brought together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices chiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromatic canoes and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders the wonder-freighted tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores chief among these latter was a great sperm whale which after an unusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his head against a cocoa-nut tree whose plumage-like tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet when the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings and the bones become dust dry in the sun then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it the ribs were hung with trophies the vertebrae were carved with arsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapoury spout while suspended from a bough the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees like the hair-hung sword that so affrighted damocles it was a wondrous sight the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen the trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver's loom with a gorgeous carpet on it whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof and the living flowers the figures all the trees with all their laden branches all the shrubs and ferns and grasses the message-carrying air all these unceasingly were active through the lacings of the leaves the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure oh busy weaver unseen weaver -- pause -- one word -- whither flows the fabric what palace may it deck wherefore all these ceaseless toilings speak weaver -- stay thy hand -- but one single word with thee nay -- the shuttle flies -- the figures float from forth the loom the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away the weaver-god he weaves and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal voice and by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it for even so it is in all material factories the spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles those same words are plainly heard without the walls bursting from the opened casements thereby have villainies been detected ah mortal then be heedful for so in all this din of the great world's loom thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar now amid the green life-restless loom of that arsacidean wood the great white worshipped skeleton lay lounging -- a gigantic idler yet as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven over with the vines every month assuming greener fresher verdure but himself a skeleton life folded death death trellised life the grim god wived with youthful life and begat him curly-headed glories now when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale and saw the skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu he laughed but more i marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine to and fro i paced before this skeleton -- brushed the vines aside -- broke through the ribs -- and with a ball of arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid its many winding shaded colonnades and arbours but soon my line was out and following it back i emerged from the opening where i entered i saw no living thing within naught was there but bones cutting me a green measuring-rod i once more dived within the skeleton from their arrow-slit in the skull the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib how now they shouted dar'st thou measure this our god that's for us aye priests -- well how long do ye make him then but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them concerning feet and inches they cracked each other's sconces with their yard-sticks -- the great skull echoed -- and seizing that lucky chance i quickly concluded my own admeasurements these admeasurements i now propose to set before you but first be it recorded that in this matter i am not free to utter any fancied measurement i please because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to to test my accuracy there is a leviathanic museum they tell me in hull england one of the whaling ports of that country where they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales likewise i have heard that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire they have what the proprietors call the only perfect specimen of a greenland or river whale in the united states moreover at a place in yorkshire england burton constable by name a certain sir clifford constable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of moderate size by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend king tranquo's in both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and sir clifford because he was lord of the seignories of those parts sir clifford's whale has been articulated throughout so that like a great chest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bony cavities -- spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan -- and swing all day upon his lower jaw locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead the skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm where i had them tattooed as in my wild wanderings at that period there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics but as i was crowded for space and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was then composing -- at least what untattooed parts might remain -- i did not trouble myself with the odd inches nor indeed should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale chapter 103 measurement of the whale's skeleton in the first place i wish to lay before you a particular plain statement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit such a statement may prove useful here according to a careful calculation i have made and which i partly base upon captain scoresby's estimate of seventy tons for the largest sized greenland whale of sixty feet in length according to my careful calculation i say a sperm whale of the largest magnitude between eighty-five and ninety feet in length and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants think you not then that brains like yoked cattle should be put to this leviathan to make him at all budge to any landsman's imagination having already in various ways put before you his skull spout-hole jaw teeth tail forehead fins and divers other parts i shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones but as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as it is by far the most complicated part and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or under your arm as we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view in length the sperm whale's skeleton at tranque measured seventy-two feet so that when fully invested and extended in life he must have been ninety feet long for in the whale the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body of this seventy-two feet his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet leaving some fifty feet of plain back-bone attached to this back-bone for something less than a third of its length was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals to me this vast ivory-ribbed chest with the long unrelieved spine extending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks when only some twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted and the keel is otherwise for the time but a long disconnected timber the ribs were ten on a side the first to begin from the neck was nearly six feet long the second third and fourth were each successively longer till you came to the climax of the fifth or one of the middle ribs which measured eight feet and some inches from that part the remaining ribs diminished till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches in general thickness they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length the middle ribs were the most arched in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams in considering these ribs i could not but be struck anew with the circumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form the largest of the tranque ribs one of the middle ones occupied that part of the fish which in life is greatest in depth now the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part besides for some way where i now saw but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowels still more for the ample fins i here saw but a few disordered joints and in place of the weighty and majestic but boneless flukes an utter blank how vain and foolish then thought i for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood no only in the heart of quickest perils only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out but the spine for that the best way we can consider it is with a crane to pile its bones high up on end no speedy enterprise but now it's done it looks much like pompey's pillar there are forty and odd vertebrae in all which in the skeleton are not locked together they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a gothic spire forming solid courses of heavy masonry the largest a middle one is in width something less than three feet and in depth more than four the smallest where the spine tapers away into the tail is only two inches in width and looks something like a white billiard-ball i was told that there were still smaller ones but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins the priest's children who had stolen them to play marbles with thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple child's play chapter 104 the fossil whale from his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge amplify and generally expatiate would you you could not compress him by good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail and the yards he measures about the waist only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a line-of-battle-ship since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological fossiliferous and antediluvian point of view applied to any other creature than the leviathan -- to an ant or a flea -- such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent but when leviathan is the text the case is altered fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary and here be it said that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations i have invariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson expressly purchased for that purpose because that famous lexicographer's uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me one often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject though it may seem but an ordinary one how then with me writing of this leviathan unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals give me a condor's quill give me vesuvius' crater for an inkstand friends hold my arms for in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this leviathan they weary me and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep as if to include the whole circle of the sciences and all the generations of whales and men and mastodons past present and to come with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not excluding its suburbs such and so magnifying is the virtue of a large and liberal theme we expand to its bulk to produce a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme no great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea though many there be who have tried it ere entering upon the subject of fossil whales i present my credentials as a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous time i have been a stone-mason and also a great digger of ditches canals and wells wine-vaults cellars and cisterns of all sorts likewise by way of preliminary i desire to remind the reader that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the tertiary formations seem the connecting or at any rate intercepted links between the antichronical creatures and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the ark all the fossil whales hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period which is the last preceding the superficial formations and though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects to justify their taking rank as cetacean fossils detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales fragments of their bones and skeletons have within thirty years past at various intervals been found at the base of the alps in lombardy in france in england in scotland and in the states of louisiana mississippi and alabama among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp in napoleon's time cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown leviathanic species but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year 1842 on the plantation of judge creagh in alabama the awe-stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile and bestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus but some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to owen the english anatomist it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale though of a departed species a significant illustration of the fact again and again repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body so owen rechristened the monster zeuglodon and in his paper read before the london geological society pronounced it in substance one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons skulls tusks jaws ribs and vertebrae all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea-monsters but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical leviathans their incalculable seniors i am by a flood borne back to that wondrous period ere time itself can be said to have begun for time began with man here saturn's grey chaos rolls over me and i obtain dim shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics and in all the 25 000 miles of this world's circumference not an inhabitable hand's breadth of land was visible then the whole world was the whale's and king of creation he left his wake along the present lines of the andes and the himmalehs who can show a pedigree like leviathan ahab's harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaoh's methuselah seems a school-boy i look round to shake hands with shem i am horror-struck at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale which having been before all time must needs exist after all humane ages are over but not alone has this leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust but upon egyptian tablets whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character we find the unmistakable print of his fin in an apartment of the great temple of denderah some fifty years ago there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere abounding in centaurs griffins and dolphins similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns gliding among them old leviathan swam as of yore was there swimming in that planisphere centuries before solomon was cradled nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale in his own osseous post-diluvian reality as set down by the venerable john leo the old barbary traveller not far from the sea-side they have a temple the rafters and beams of which are made of whale-bones for whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore the common people imagine that by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple no whale can pass it without immediate death but the truth of the matter is that on either side of the temple there are rocks that shoot two miles into the sea and wound the whales when they light upon 'em they keep a whale's rib of an incredible length for a miracle which lying upon the ground with its convex part uppermost makes an arch the head of which cannot be reached by a man upon a camel's back this rib says john leo is said to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it their historians affirm that a prophet who prophesy'd of mahomet came from this temple and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jonas was cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple in this afric temple of the whale i leave you reader and if you be a nantucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship there chapter 105 does the whale's magnitude diminish -- will he perish inasmuch then as this leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the head-waters of the eternities it may be fitly inquired whether in the long course of his generations he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires but upon investigation we find that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the tertiary system embracing a distinct geological period prior to man but of the whales found in that tertiary system those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed by far the largest is the alabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton whereas we have already seen that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale and i have heard on whalemen's authority that sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture but may it not be that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods may it not be that since adam's time they have degenerated assuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as pliny and the ancient naturalists generally for pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk and aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length -- rope walks and thames tunnels of whales and even in the days of banks and solander cooke's naturalists we find a danish member of the academy of sciences setting down certain iceland whales reydan-siskur or wrinkled bellies at one hundred and twenty yards that is three hundred and sixty feet and lacepede the french naturalist in his elaborate history of whales in the very beginning of his work page 3 sets down the right whale at one hundred metres three hundred and twenty-eight feet and this work was published so late as a d 1825 but will any whaleman believe these stories no the whale of to-day is as big as his ancestors in pliny's time and if ever i go where pliny is i a whaleman more than he was will make bold to tell him so because i cannot understand how it is that while the egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even pliny was born do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian in his socks and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest egyptian and nineveh tablets by the relative proportions in which they are drawn just as plainly prove that the high-bred stall-fed prize cattle of smithfield not only equal but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of pharaoh's fat kine in the face of all this i will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated but still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the more recondite nantucketers whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs at the mast-heads of the whaleships now penetrating even through behring's straits and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts the moot point is whether leviathan can long endure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters and the last whale like the last man smoke his last pipe and then himself evaporate in the final puff comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo which not forty years ago overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of illinois and missouri and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous river-capitals where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction but you must look at this matter in every light though so short a period ago -- not a good lifetime -- the census of the buffalo in illinois exceeded the census of men now in london and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man yet the far different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the leviathan forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whales for forty-eight months think they have done extremely well and thank god if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish whereas in the days of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west when the far west in whose sunset suns still rise was a wilderness and a virgin the same number of moccasined men for the same number of months mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships would have slain not forty but forty thousand and more buffaloes a fact that if need were could be statistically stated nor considered aright does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the sperm whale for example that in former years the latter part of the last century say these leviathans in small pods were encountered much oftener than at present and in consequence the voyages were not so prolonged and were also much more remunerative because as has been elsewhere noticed those whales influenced by some views to safety now swim the seas in immense caravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokes and pods and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated unfrequent armies that is all and equally fallacious seems the conceit that because the so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them hence that species also is declining for they are only being driven from promontory to cape and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets then be sure some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle furthermore concerning these last mentioned leviathans they have two firm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remain impregnable and as upon the invasion of their valleys the frosty swiss have retreated to their mountains so hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas the whale-bone whales can at last resort to their polar citadels and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmed circle of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man but as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions but though for some time past a number of these whales not less than 13 000 have been annually slain on the nor'-west coast by the americans alone yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe yet what shall we say to harto the historian of goa when he tells us that at one hunting the king of siam took 4 000 elephants that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes and there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants which have now been hunted for thousands of years by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by all the successive monarchs of the east -- if they still survive there in great numbers much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since he has a pasture to expatiate in which is precisely twice as large as all asia both americas europe and africa new holland and all the isles of the sea combined moreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity of whales their probably attaining the age of a century and more therefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generations must be contemporary and what that is we may soon gain some idea of by imagining all the grave-yards cemeteries and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men women and children who were alive seventy-five years ago and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe wherefore for all these things we account the whale immortal in his species however perishable in his individuality he swam the seas before the continents broke water he once swam over the site of the tuileries and windsor castle and the kremlin in noah's flood he despised noah's ark and if ever the world is to be again flooded like the netherlands to kill off its rats then the eternal whale will still survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood spout his frothed defiance to the skies chapter 106 ahab's leg the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel enderby of london had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock and when after gaining his own deck and his own pivot-hole there he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman it was as ever something about his not steering inflexibly enough then the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench that though it still remained entire and to all appearances lusty yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy and indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all his pervading mad recklessness ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood for it had not been very long prior to the pequod's sailing from nantucket that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground and insensible by some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty his ivory limb having been so violently displaced that it had stake-wise smitten and all but pierced his groin nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured nor at the time had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove so equally with every felicity all miserable events do naturally beget their like yea more than equally thought ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy for not to hint of this that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world but on the contrary shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell's despair whereas some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing for thought ahab while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mystic significance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction to trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods so that in the face of all the glad hay-making suns and soft cymballing round harvest-moons we must needs give in to this that the gods themselves are not for ever glad the ineffaceable sad birth-mark in the brow of man is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers unwittingly here a secret has been divulged which perhaps might more properly in set way have been disclosed before with many other particulars concerning ahab always had it remained a mystery to some why it was that for a certain period both before and after the sailing of the pequod he had hidden himself away with such grand-lama-like exclusiveness and for that one interval sought speechless refuge as it were among the marble senate of the dead captain peleg's bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate though indeed as touching all ahab's deeper part every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light but in the end it all came out this one matter did at least that direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness and not only this but to that ever-contracting dropping circle ashore who for any reason possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him to that timid circle the above hinted casualty -- remaining as it did moodily unaccounted for by ahab -- invested itself with terrors not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails so that through their zeal for him they had all conspired so far as in them lay to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others and hence it was that not till a considerable interval had elapsed did it transpire upon the pequod's decks but be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire have to do or not with earthly ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he took plain practical procedures -- he called the carpenter and when that functionary appeared before him he bade him without delay set about making a new leg and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory sperm whale which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a careful selection of the stoutest clearest-grained stuff might be secured this done the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night and to provide all the fittings for it independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use moreover the ship's forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold and to accelerate the affair the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed chapter 107 the carpenter seat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn and take high abstracted man alone and he seems a wonder a grandeur and a woe but from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates both contemporary and hereditary but most humble though he was and far from furnishing an example of the high humane abstraction the pequod's carpenter was no duplicate hence he now comes in person on this stage like all sea-going ship carpenters and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels he was to a certain off-handed practical extent alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material but besides the application to him of the generic remark above this carpenter of the pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship upon a three or four years' voyage in uncivilized and far-distant seas for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties -- repairing stove boats sprung spars reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars inserting bull's eyes in the deck or new tree-nails in the side planks and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes both useful and capricious the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold was his vice-bench a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices of different sizes and both of iron and of wood at all times except when whales were alongside this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the try-works a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices and straightway files it smaller a lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board and is made a captive out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it an oarsman sprains his wrist the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar screwing each oar in his big vice of wood the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation a sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings the carpenter drills his ears another has the toothache the carpenter out pincers and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation whirling round the handle of his wooden vice the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth thus this carpenter was prepared at all points and alike indifferent and without respect in all teeth he accounted bits of ivory heads he deemed but top-blocks men themselves he lightly held for capstans but while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence but not precisely so for nothing was this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were impersonal i say for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes still eternally holds its peace and ignores you though you dig foundations for cathedrals yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him involving too as it appeared an all-ramifying heartlessness -- yet was it oddly dashed at times with an old crutch-like antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noah's ark was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered no moss but what is more had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him he was a stript abstract an unfractioned integral uncompromised as a new-born babe living without premeditated reference to this world or the next you might almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence for in his numerous trades he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct or simply because he had been tutored to it or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process he was a pure manipulator his brain if he had ever had one must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers he was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful multum in parvo sheffield contrivances assuming the exterior -- though a little swelled -- of a common pocket knife but containing not only blades of various sizes but also screw-drivers cork-screws tweezers awls pens rulers nail-filers countersinkers so if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw-driver all they had to do was to open that part of him and the screw was fast or if for tweezers take him up by the legs and there they were yet as previously hinted this omnitooled open-and-shut carpenter was after all no mere machine of an automaton if he did not have a common soul in him he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty what that was whether essence of quicksilver or a few drops of hartshorn there is no telling but there it was and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more and this it was this same unaccountable cunning life-principle in him this it was that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his body was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the time to keep himself awake chapter 108 ahab and the carpenter the deck -- first night watch carpenter standing before his vice-bench and by the light of two lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg which joist is firmly fixed in the vice slabs of ivory leather straps pads screws and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench forward the red flame of the forge is seen where the blacksmith is at work drat the file and drat the bone that is hard which should be soft and that is soft which should be hard so we go who file old jaws and shinbones let's try another aye now this works better sneezes halloa this bone dust is sneezes -- why it's sneezes -- yes it's sneezes -- bless my soul it won't let me speak this is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber saw a live tree and you don't get this dust amputate a live bone and you don't get it sneezes come come you old smut there bear a hand and let's have that ferule and buckle-screw i'll be ready for them presently lucky now sneezes there's no knee-joint to make that might puzzle a little but a mere shinbone -- why it's easy as making hop-poles only i should like to put a good finish on time time if i but only had the time i could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever sneezes scraped to a lady in a parlor those buckskin legs and calves of legs i've seen in shop windows wouldn't compare at all they soak water they do and of course get rheumatic and have to be doctored sneezes with washes and lotions just like live legs there before i saw it off now i must call his old mogulship and see whether the length will be all right too short if anything i guess ha that's the heel we are in luck here he comes or it's somebody else that's certain ahab advancing during the ensuing scene the carpenter continues sneezing at times well manmaker just in time sir if the captain pleases i will now mark the length let me measure sir measured for a leg good well it's not the first time about it there keep thy finger on it this is a cogent vice thou hast here carpenter let me feel its grip once so so it does pinch some oh sir it will break bones -- beware beware no fear i like a good grip i like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold man what's prometheus about there -- the blacksmith i mean -- what's he about he must be forging the buckle-screw sir now right it's a partnership he supplies the muscle part he makes a fierce red flame there aye sir he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work um-m so he must i do deem it now a most meaning thing that that old greek prometheus who made men they say should have been a blacksmith and animated them with fire for what's made in fire must properly belong to fire and so hell's probable how the soot flies this must be the remainder the greek made the africans of carpenter when he's through with that buckle tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder-blades there's a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack sir hold while prometheus is about it i'll order a complete man after a desirable pattern imprimis fifty feet high in his socks then chest modelled after the thames tunnel then legs with roots to 'em to stay in one place then arms three feet through the wrist no heart at all brass forehead and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains and let me see -- shall i order eyes to see outwards no but put a sky-light on top of his head to illuminate inwards there take the order and away now what's he speaking about and who's he speaking to i should like to know shall i keep standing here aside 'tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome here's one no no no i must have a lantern ho ho that's it hey here are two sir one will serve my turn what art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for man thrusted light is worse than presented pistols i thought sir that you spoke to carpenter carpenter why that's -- but no -- a very tidy and i may say an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here carpenter -- or would'st thou rather work in clay sir -- clay clay sir that's mud we leave clay to ditchers sir the fellow's impious what art thou sneezing about bone is rather dusty sir take the hint then and when thou art dead never bury thyself under living people's noses sir -- oh ah -- i guess so -- yes -- dear look ye carpenter i dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman eh well then will it speak thoroughly well for thy work if when i come to mount this leg thou makest i shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it that is carpenter my old lost leg the flesh and blood one i mean canst thou not drive that old adam away truly sir i begin to understand somewhat now yes i have heard something curious on that score sir how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar but it will be still pricking him at times may i humbly ask if it be really so sir it is man look put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was so now here is only one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the soul where thou feelest tingling life there exactly there there to a hair do i is't a riddle i should humbly call it a poser sir hist then how dost thou know that some entire living thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest aye and standing there in thy spite in thy most solitary hours then dost thou not fear eavesdroppers hold don't speak and if i still feel the smart of my crushed leg though it be now so long dissolved then why mayst not thou carpenter feel the fiery pains of hell for ever and without a body hah good lord truly sir if it comes to that i must calculate over again i think i didn't carry a small figure sir look ye pudding-heads should never grant premises -- how long before the leg is done perhaps an hour sir bungle away at it then and bring it to me turns to go oh life here i am proud as greek god and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers i would be free as air and i'm down in the whole world's books i am so rich i could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest praetorians at the auction of the roman empire which was the world's and yet i owe for the flesh in the tongue i brag with by heavens i'll get a crucible and into it and dissolve myself down to one small compendious vertebra so carpenter resuming his work well well well stubb knows him best of all and stubb always says he's queer says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer he's queer says stubb he's queer -- queer queer and keeps dinning it into mr starbuck all the time -- queer -- sir -- queer queer very queer and here's his leg yes now that i think of it here's his bedfellow has a stick of whale's jaw-bone for a wife and this is his leg he'll stand on this what was that now about one leg standing in three places and all three places standing in one hell -- how was that oh i don't wonder he looked so scornful at me i'm a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes they say but that's only haphazard-like then a short little old body like me should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall heron-built captains the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick and there's a great cry for life-boats and here's the heron's leg long and slim sure enough now for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime and that must be because they use them mercifully as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses but ahab oh he's a hard driver look driven one leg to death and spavined the other for life and now wears out bone legs by the cord halloa there you smut bear a hand there with those screws and let's finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his horn for all legs true or false as brewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels to fill 'em up again what a leg this is it looks like a real live leg filed down to nothing but the core he'll be standing on this to-morrow he'll be taking altitudes on it halloa i almost forgot the little oval slate smoothed ivory where he figures up the latitude so so chisel file and sand-paper now chapter 109 ahab and starbuck in the cabin according to usage they were pumping the ship next morning and lo no inconsiderable oil came up with the water the casks below must have sprung a bad leak much concern was shown and starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair in sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench the casks with sea-water which afterwards at varying intervals is removed by the ship's pumps hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight while by the changed character of the withdrawn water the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo now from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosa and the bashee isles between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the china waters into the pacific and so starbuck found ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the japanese islands -- niphon matsmai and sikoke with his snow-white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand the wondrous old man with his back to the gangway door was wrinkling his brow and tracing his old courses again who's there hearing the footstep at the door but not turning round to it on deck begone captain ahab mistakes it is i the oil in the hold is leaking sir we must up burtons and break out up burtons and break out now that we are nearing japan heave-to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year what we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving sir so it is so it is if we get it i was speaking of the oil in the hold sir and i was not speaking or thinking of that at all begone let it leak i'm all aleak myself aye leaks in leaks not only full of leaky casks but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship and that's a far worse plight than the pequod's man yet i don't stop to plug my leak for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull or how hope to plug it even if found in this life's howling gale starbuck i'll not have the burtons hoisted what will the owners say sir let the owners stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoons what cares ahab owners owners thou art always prating to me starbuck about those miserly owners as if the owners were my conscience but look ye the only real owner of anything is its commander and hark ye my conscience is in this ship's keel -- on deck captain ahab said the reddening mate moving further into the cabin with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself a better man than i might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man aye and in a happier captain ahab devils dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me -- on deck nay sir not yet i do entreat and i do dare sir -- to be forbearing shall we not understand each other better than hitherto captain ahab ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of most south-sea-men's cabin furniture and pointing it towards starbuck exclaimed there is one god that is lord over the earth and one captain that is lord over the pequod -- on deck for an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate and his fiery cheeks you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube but mastering his emotion he half calmly rose and as he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said thou hast outraged not insulted me sir but for that i ask thee not to beware of starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of thyself old man he waxes brave but nevertheless obeys most careful bravery that murmured ahab as starbuck disappeared what's that he said -- ahab beware of ahab -- there's something there then unconsciously using the musket for a staff with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed and returning the gun to the rack he went to the deck thou art but too good a fellow starbuck he said lowly to the mate then raising his voice to the crew furl the t'gallant-sails and close-reef the top-sails fore and aft back the main-yard up burton and break out in the main-hold it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was that as respecting starbuck ahab thus acted it may have been a flash of honesty in him or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection however transient in the important chief officer of his ship however it was his orders were executed and the burtons were hoisted chapter 110 queequeg in his coffin upon searching it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound and that the leak must be further off so it being calm weather they broke out deeper and deeper disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above so deep did they go and so ancient and corroded and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask containing coins of captain noah with copies of the posted placards vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood tierce after tierce too of water and bread and beef and shooks of staves and iron bundles of hoops were hoisted out till at last the piled decks were hard to get about and the hollow hull echoed under foot as if you were treading over empty catacombs and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all aristotle in his head well was it that the typhoons did not visit them then now at this time it was that my poor pagan companion and fast bosom-friend queequeg was seized with a fever which brought him nigh to his endless end be it said that in this vocation of whaling sinecures are unknown dignity and danger go hand in hand till you get to be captain the higher you rise the harder you toil so with poor queequeg who as harpooneer must not only face all the rage of the living whale but -- as we have elsewhere seen -- mount his dead back in a rolling sea and finally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage to be short among whalemen the harpooneers are the holders so called poor queequeg when the ship was about half disembowelled you should have stooped over the hatchway and peered down upon him there where stripped to his woollen drawers the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well and a well or an ice-house it somehow proved to him poor pagan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweatings he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever and at last after some days' suffering laid him in his hammock close to the very sill of the door of death how he wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing but as all else in him thinned and his cheek-bones grew sharper his eyes nevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened and like circles on the water which as they grow fainter expand so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding like the rings of eternity an awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage and saw as strange things in his face as any beheld who were bystanders when zoroaster died for whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man never yet was put into words or books and the drawing near of death which alike levels all alike impresses all with a last revelation which only an author from the dead could adequately tell so that -- let us say it again -- no dying chaldee or greek had higher and holier thoughts than those whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor queequeg as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest and the ocean's invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven not a man of the crew but gave him up and as for queequeg himself what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked he called one to him in the grey morning watch when the day was just breaking and taking his hand said that while in nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood like the rich war-wood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had learned that all whalemen who died in nantucket were laid in those same dark canoes and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him for it was not unlike the custom of his own race who after embalming a dead warrior stretched him out in his canoe and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes for not only do they believe that the stars are isles but that far beyond all visible horizons their own mild uncontinented seas interflow with the blue heavens and so form the white breakers of the milky way he added that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual sea-custom tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks no he desired a canoe like those of nantucket all the more congenial to him being a whaleman that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering and much lee-way adown the dim ages now when this strange circumstance was made known aft the carpenter was at once commanded to do queequeg's bidding whatever it might include there was some heathenish coffin-coloured old lumber aboard which upon a long previous voyage had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the lackaday islands and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made no sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order than taking his rule he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character proceeded into the forecastle and took queequeg's measure with great accuracy regularly chalking queequeg's person as he shifted the rule ah poor fellow he'll have to die now ejaculated the long island sailor going to his vice-bench the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities this done he marshalled the planks and his tools and to work when the last nail was driven and the lid duly planed and fitted he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away queequeg to every one's consternation commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him nor was there any denying him seeing that of all mortals some dying men are the most tyrannical and certainly since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore the poor fellows ought to be indulged leaning over in his hammock queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye he then called for his harpoon had the wooden stock drawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat all by his own request also biscuits were then ranged round the sides within a flask of fresh water was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed that he might make trial of its comforts if any it had he lay without moving a few minutes then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god yojo then crossing his arms on his breast with yojo between he called for the coffin lid hatch he called it to be placed over him the head part turned over with a leather hinge and there lay queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view rarmai it will do it is easy he murmured at last and signed to be replaced in his hammock but ere this was done pip who had been slily hovering near by all this while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sobbings took him by the hand in the other holding his tambourine poor rover will ye never have done with all this weary roving where go ye now but if the currents carry ye to those sweet antilles where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies will ye do one little errand for me seek out one pip who's now been missing long i think he's in those far antilles if ye find him then comfort him for he must be very sad for look he's left his tambourine behind -- i found it rig-a-dig dig dig now queequeg die and i'll beat ye your dying march i have heard murmured starbuck gazing down the scuttle that in violent fevers men all ignorance have talked in ancient tongues and that when the mystery is probed it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars so to my fond faith poor pip in this strange sweetness of his lunacy brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes where learned he that but there -- hark he speaks again but more wildly now form two and two let's make a general of him ho where's his harpoon lay it across here -- rig-a-dig dig dig huzza oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow queequeg dies game -- mind ye that queequeg dies game -- take ye good heed of that queequeg dies game i say game game game but base little pip he died a coward died all a'shiver -- out upon pip hark ye if ye find pip tell all the antilles he's a runaway a coward a coward a coward tell them he jumped from a whale-boat i'd never beat my tambourine over base pip and hail him general if he were once more dying here no no shame upon all cowards -- shame upon them let 'em go drown like pip that jumped from a whale-boat shame shame during all this queequeg lay with closed eyes as if in a dream pip was led away and the sick man was replaced in his hammock but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death now that his coffin was proved a good fit queequeg suddenly rallied soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box and thereupon when some expressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this -- at a critical moment he had just recalled a little duty ashore which he was leaving undone and therefore had changed his mind about dying he could not die yet he averred they asked him then whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure he answered certainly in a word it was queequeg's conceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a gale or some violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort now there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized that while a sick civilized man may be six months convalescing generally speaking a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day so in good time my queequeg gained strength and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days but eating with a vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet threw out his arms and legs gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon pronounced himself fit for a fight with a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a sea-chest and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order there many spare hours he spent in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings and it seemed that hereby he was striving in his rude way to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic marks had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth so that queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one volume but whose mysteries not even himself could read though his own live heart beat against them and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed and so be unsolved to the last and this thought it must have been which suggested to ahab that wild exclamation of his when one morning turning away from surveying poor queequeg -- oh devilish tantalization of the gods chapter 111 the pacific when gliding by the bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great south sea were it not for other things i could have greeted my dear pacific with uncounted thanks for now the long supplication of my youth was answered that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue there is one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath like those fabled undulations of the ephesian sod over the buried evangelist st john and meet it is that over these sea-pastures wide-rolling watery prairies and potters' fields of all four continents the waves should rise and fall and ebb and flow unceasingly for here millions of mixed shades and shadows drowned dreams somnambulisms reveries all that we call lives and souls lie dreaming dreaming still tossing like slumberers in their beds the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness to any meditative magian rover this serene pacific once beheld must ever after be the sea of his adoption it rolls the midmost waters of the world the indian ocean and atlantic being but its arms the same waves wash the moles of the new-built californian towns but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of asiatic lands older than abraham while all between float milky-ways of coral isles and low-lying endless unknown archipelagoes and impenetrable japans thus this mysterious divine pacific zones the world's whole bulk about makes all coasts one bay to it seems the tide-beating heart of earth lifted by those eternal swells you needs must own the seductive god bowing your head to pan but few thoughts of pan stirred ahab's brain as standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the bashee isles in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea that sea in which the hated white whale must even then be swimming launched at length upon these almost final waters and gliding towards the japanese cruising-ground the old man's purpose intensified itself his firm lips met like the lips of a vice the delta of his forehead's veins swelled like overladen brooks in his very sleep his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull stern all the white whale spouts thick blood chapter 112 the blacksmith availing himself of the mild summer-cool weather that now reigned in these latitudes and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated perth the begrimed blistered old blacksmith had not removed his portable forge to the hold again after concluding his contributory work for ahab's leg but still retained it on deck fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen and harpooneers and bowsmen to do some little job for them altering or repairing or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture often he would be surrounded by an eager circle all waiting to be served holding boat-spades pike-heads harpoons and lances and jealously watching his every sooty movement as he toiled nevertheless this old man's was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm no murmur no impatience no petulance did come from him silent slow and solemn bowing over still further his chronically broken back he toiled away as if toil were life itself and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart and so it was -- most miserable a peculiar walk in this old man a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners and to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate belated and not innocently one bitter winter's midnight on the road running between two country towns the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him and sought refuge in a leaning dilapidated barn the issue was the loss of the extremities of both feet out of this revelation part by part at last came out the four acts of the gladness and the one long and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life's drama he was an old man who at the age of nearly sixty had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow's technicals called ruin he had been an artisan of famed excellence and with plenty to do owned a house and garden embraced a youthful daughter-like loving wife and three blithe ruddy children every sunday went to a cheerful-looking church planted in a grove but one night under cover of darkness and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement a desperate burglar slid into his happy home and robbed them all of everything and darker yet to tell the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family's heart it was the bottle conjuror upon the opening of that fatal cork forth flew the fiend and shrivelled up his home now for prudent most wise and economic reasons the blacksmith's shop was in the basement of his dwelling but with a separate entrance to it so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness but with vigorous pleasure to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband's hammer whose reverberations muffled by passing through the floors and walls came up to her not unsweetly in her nursery and so to stout labor's iron lullaby the blacksmith's infants were rocked to slumber oh woe on woe oh death why canst thou not sometimes be timely hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him then had the young widow had a delicious grief and her orphans a truly venerable legendary sire to dream of in their after years and all of them a care-killing competency but death plucked down some virtuous elder brother on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family and left the worse than useless old man standing till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest why tell the whole the blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between and each blow every day grew fainter than the last the wife sat frozen at the window with tearless eyes glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children the bellows fell the forge choked up with cinders the house was sold the mother dived down into the long church-yard grass her children twice followed her thither and the houseless familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape his every woe unreverenced his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this but death is only a launching into the region of the strange untried it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense remote the wild the watery the unshored therefore to the death-longing eyes of such men who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable taking terrors and wonderful new-life adventures and from the hearts of infinite pacifics the thousand mermaids sing to them -- come hither broken-hearted here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death here are wonders supernatural without dying for them come hither bury thyself in a life which to your now equally abhorred and abhorring landed world is more oblivious than death come hither put up thy gravestone too within the churchyard and come hither till we marry thee hearkening to these voices east and west by early sunrise and by fall of eve the blacksmith's soul responded aye i come and so perth went a-whaling chapter 113 the forge with matted beard and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron about mid-day perth was standing between his forge and anvil the latter placed upon an iron-wood log with one hand holding a pike-head in the coals and with the other at his forge's lungs when captain ahab came along carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag while yet a little distance from the forge moody ahab paused till at last perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammering it upon the anvil -- the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights some of which flew close to ahab are these thy mother carey's chickens perth they are always flying in thy wake birds of good omen too but not to all -- look here they burn but thou -- thou liv'st among them without a scorch because i am scorched all over captain ahab answered perth resting for a moment on his hammer i am past scorching not easily can'st thou scorch a scar well well no more thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly sanely woeful to me in no paradise myself i am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad thou should'st go mad blacksmith say why dost thou not go mad how can'st thou endure without being mad do the heavens yet hate thee that thou can'st not go mad -- what wert thou making there welding an old pike-head sir there were seams and dents in it and can'st thou make it all smooth again blacksmith after such hard usage as it had i think so sir and i suppose thou can'st smoothe almost any seams and dents never mind how hard the metal blacksmith aye sir i think i can all seams and dents but one look ye here then cried ahab passionately advancing and leaning with both hands on perth's shoulders look ye here -- here -- can ye smoothe out a seam like this blacksmith sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow if thou could'st blacksmith glad enough would i lay my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes answer can'st thou smoothe this seam oh that is the one sir said i not all seams and dents but one aye blacksmith it is the one aye man it is unsmoothable for though thou only see'st it here in my flesh it has worked down into the bone of my skull -- that is all wrinkles but away with child's play no more gaffs and pikes to-day look ye here jingling the leathern bag as if it were full of gold coins i too want a harpoon made one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part perth something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone there's the stuff flinging the pouch upon the anvil look ye blacksmith these are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses horse-shoe stubbs sir why captain ahab thou hast here then the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work i know it old man these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers quick forge me the harpoon and forge me first twelve rods for its shank then wind and twist and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line quick i'll blow the fire when at last the twelve rods were made ahab tried them one by one by spiralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron bolt a flaw rejecting the last one work that over again perth this done perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one when ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron as then with regular gasping hems he hammered on the anvil perth passing to him the glowing rods one after the other and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame the parsee passed silently and bowing over his head towards the fire seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil but as ahab looked up he slid aside what's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for muttered stubb looking on from the forecastle that parsee smells fire like a fusee and smells of it himself like a hot musket's powder-pan at last the shank in one complete rod received its final heat and as perth to temper it plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by the scalding steam shot up into ahab's bent face would'st thou brand me perth wincing for a moment with the pain have i been but forging my own branding-iron then pray god not that yet i fear something captain ahab is not this harpoon for the white whale for the white fiend but now for the barbs thou must make them thyself man here are my razors -- the best of steel here and make the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the icy sea for a moment the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them take them man i have no need for them for i now neither shave sup nor pray till -- but here -- to work fashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by perth to the shank the steel soon pointed the end of the iron and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat prior to tempering them he cried to ahab to place the water-cask near no no -- no water for that i want it of the true death-temper ahoy there tashtego queequeg daggoo what say ye pagans will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb holding it high up a cluster of dark nods replied yes three punctures were made in the heathen flesh and the white whale's barbs were then tempered ego non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli deliriously howled ahab as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood now mustering the spare poles from below and selecting one of hickory with the bark still investing it ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron a coil of new tow-line was then unwound and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension pressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harp-string then eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandings ahab exclaimed good and now for the seizings at one extremity the rope was unstranded and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole was then driven hard up into the socket from the lower end the rope was traced half-way along the pole's length and firmly secured so with intertwistings of twine this done pole iron and rope -- like the three fates -- remained inseparable and ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole both hollowly ringing along every plank but ere he entered his cabin light unnatural half-bantering yet most piteous sound was heard oh pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship and mocked it chapter 114 the gilder penetrating further and further into the heart of the japanese cruising ground the pequod was soon all astir in the fishery often in mild pleasant weather for twelve fifteen eighteen and twenty hours on the stretch they were engaged in the boats steadily pulling or sailing or paddling after the whales or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising though with but small success for their pains at such times under an abated sun afloat all day upon smooth slow heaving swells seated in his boat light as a birch canoe and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves that like hearth-stone cats they purr against the gunwale these are the times of dreamy quietude when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean's skin one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it and would not willingly remember that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang these are the times when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a certain filial confident land-like feeling towards the sea that he regards it as so much flowery earth and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts seems struggling forward not through high rolling waves but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie as when the western emigrants' horses only show their erected ears while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure the long-drawn virgin vales the mild blue hill-sides as over these there steals the hush the hum you almost swear that play-wearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes in some glad may-time when the flowers of the woods are plucked and all this mixes with your most mystic mood so that fact and fancy half-way meeting interpenetrate and form one seamless whole nor did such soothing scenes however temporary fail of at least as temporary an effect on ahab but if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing oh grassy glades oh ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul in ye -- though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life -- in ye men yet may roll like young horses in new morning clover and for some few fleeting moments feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them would to god these blessed calms would last but the mingled mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof calms crossed by storms a storm for every calm there is no steady unretracing progress in this life we do not advance through fixed gradations and at the last one pause -- through infancy's unconscious spell boyhood's thoughtless faith adolescence' doubt the common doom then scepticism then disbelief resting at last in manhood's pondering repose of if but once gone through we trace the round again and are infants boys and men and ifs eternally where lies the final harbor whence we unmoor no more in what rapt ether sails the world of which the weariest will never weary where is the foundling's father hidden our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them the secret of our paternity lies in their grave and we must there to learn it and that same day too gazing far down from his boat's side into that same golden sea starbuck lowly murmured -- loveliness unfathomable as ever lover saw in his young bride's eye -- tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks and thy kidnapping cannibal ways let faith oust fact let fancy oust memory i look deep down and do believe and stubb fish-like with sparkling scales leaped up in that same golden light -- i am stubb and stubb has his history but here stubb takes oaths that he has always been jolly chapter 115 the pequod meets the bachelor and jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind some few weeks after ahab's harpoon had been welded it was a nantucket ship the bachelor which had just wedged in her last cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatches and now in glad holiday apparel was joyously though somewhat vain-gloriously sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground previous to pointing her prow for home the three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats from the stern a whale-boat was suspended bottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain signals ensigns and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging on every side sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm above which in her top-mast cross-trees you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp as was afterwards learned the bachelor had met with the most surprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for from the ships she had met and these were stowed along the deck and in the captain's and officers' state-rooms even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil-butt lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece in the forecastle the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests and filled them it was humorously added that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler and filled it that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them that indeed everything was filled with sperm except the captain's pantaloons pockets and those he reserved to thrust his hands into in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle and drawing still nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try-pots which covered with the parchment-like poke or stomach skin of the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew on the quarter-deck the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the polynesian isles while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast three long island negroes with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory were presiding over the hilarious jig meanwhile others of the ship's company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works from which the huge pots had been removed you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed bastille such wild cries they raised as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea lord and master over all this scene the captain stood erect on the ship's elevated quarter-deck so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion and ahab he too was standing on his quarter-deck shaggy and black with a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each other's wakes -- one all jubilations for things passed the other all forebodings as to things to come -- their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene come aboard come aboard cried the gay bachelor's commander lifting a glass and a bottle in the air hast seen the white whale gritted ahab in reply no only heard of him but don't believe in him at all said the other good-humoredly come aboard thou art too damned jolly sail on hast lost any men not enough to speak of -- two islanders that's all -- but come aboard old hearty come along i'll soon take that black from your brow come along will ye merry's the play a full ship and homeward-bound how wondrous familiar is a fool muttered ahab then aloud thou art a full ship and homeward bound thou sayst well then call me an empty ship and outward-bound so go thy ways and i will mine forward there set all sail and keep her to the wind and thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other stubbornly fought against it and so the two vessels parted the crew of the pequod looking with grave lingering glances towards the receding bachelor but the bachelor's men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in and as ahab leaning over the taffrail eyed the homewardbound craft he took from his pocket a small vial of sand and then looking from the ship to the vial seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together for that vial was filled with nantucket soundings chapter 116 the dying whale not seldom in this life when on the right side fortune's favourites sail close by us we though all adroop before catch somewhat of the rushing breeze and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out so seemed it with the pequod for next day after encountering the gay bachelor whales were seen and four were slain and one of them by ahab it was far down the afternoon and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun and whale both stilly died together then such a sweetness and such plaintiveness such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the manilla isles the spanish land-breeze wantonly turned sailor had gone to sea freighted with these vesper hymns soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom ahab who had sterned off from the whale sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat for that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dying -- the turning sunwards of the head and so expiring -- that strange spectacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before he turns and turns him to it -- how slowly but how steadfastly his homage-rendering and invoking brow with his last dying motions he too worships fire most faithful broad baronial vassal of the sun -- oh that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights look here far water-locked beyond all hum of human weal or woe in these most candid and impartial seas where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets where for long chinese ages the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to as stars that shine upon the niger's unknown source here too life dies sunwards full of faith but see no sooner dead than death whirls round the corpse and it heads some other way oh thou dark hindoo half of nature who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas thou art an infidel thou queen and too truly speakest to me in the wide-slaughtering typhoon and the hushed burial of its after calm nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head and then gone round again without a lesson to me oh trebly hooped and welded hip of power oh high aspiring rainbowed jet -- that one strivest this one jettest all in vain in vain oh whale dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening sun that only calls forth life but gives it not again yet dost thou darker half rock me with a prouder if a darker faith all thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here i am buoyed by breaths of once living things exhaled as air but water now then hail for ever hail o sea in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds his only rest born of earth yet suckled by the sea though hill and valley mothered me ye billows are my foster-brothers chapter 117 the whale watch the four whales slain that evening had died wide apart one far to windward one less distant to leeward one ahead one astern these last three were brought alongside ere nightfall but the windward one could not be reached till morning and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night and that boat was ahab's the waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale's spout-hole and the lantern hanging from its top cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight waves which gently chafed the whale's broad flank like soft surf upon a beach ahab and all his boat's crew seemed asleep but the parsee who crouching in the bow sat watching the sharks that spectrally played round the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails a sound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of gomorrah ran shuddering through the air started from his slumbers ahab face to face saw the parsee and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world i have dreamed it again said he of the hearses have i not said old man that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine and who are hearsed that die on the sea but i said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea the first not made by mortal hands and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in america aye aye a strange sight that parsee -- a hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers ha such a sight we shall not soon see believe it or not thou canst not die till it be seen old man and what was that saying about thyself though it come to the last i shall still go before thee thy pilot and when thou art so gone before -- if that ever befall -- then ere i can follow thou must still appear to me to pilot me still -- was it not so well then did i believe all ye say oh my pilot i have here two pledges that i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it take another pledge old man said the parsee as his eyes lighted up like fire-flies in the gloom -- hemp only can kill thee the gallows ye mean -- i am immortal then on land and on sea cried ahab with a laugh of derision -- immortal on land and on sea both were silent again as one man the grey dawn came on and the slumbering crew arose from the boat's bottom and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship chapter 118 the quadrant the season for the line at length drew near and every day when ahab coming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the ship's prow for the equator in good time the order came it was hard upon high noon and ahab seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude now in that japanese sea the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean's immeasurable burning-glass the sky looks lacquered clouds there are none the horizon floats and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of god's throne well that ahab's quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses through which to take sight of that solar fire so swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship and with his astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian meantime while his whole attention was absorbed the parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship's deck and with face thrown up like ahab's was eyeing the same sun with him only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness at length the desired observation was taken and with his pencil upon his ivory leg ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant then falling into a moment's revery he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself thou sea-mark thou high and mighty pilot thou tellest me truly where i am -- but canst thou cast the least hint where i shall be or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living where is moby dick this instant thou must be eyeing him these eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him aye and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown thither side of thee thou sun then gazing at his quadrant and handling one after the other its numerous cabalistical contrivances he pondered again and muttered foolish toy babies' plaything of haughty admirals and commodores and captains the world brags of thee of thy cunning and might but what after all canst thou do but tell the poor pitiful point where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet and the hand that holds thee no not one jot more thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun science curse thee thou vain toy and cursed be all the things that cast man's eyes aloft to that heaven whose live vividness but scorches him as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light o sun level by nature to this earth's horizon are the glances of man's eyes not shot from the crown of his head as if god had meant him to gaze on his firmament curse thee thou quadrant dashing it to the deck no longer will i guide my earthly way by thee the level ship's compass and the level deadreckoning by log and by line these shall conduct me and show me my place on the sea aye lighting from the boat to the deck thus i trample on thee thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high thus i split and destroy thee as the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself -- these passed over the mute motionless parsee's face unobserved he rose and glided away while awestruck by the aspect of their commander the seamen clustered together on the forecastle till ahab troubledly pacing the deck shouted out -- to the braces up helm -- square in in an instant the yards swung round and as the ship half-wheeled upon her heel her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long ribbed hull seemed as the three horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed standing between the knight-heads starbuck watched the pequod's tumultuous way and ahab's also as he went lurching along the deck i have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow full of its tormented flaming life and i have seen it wane at last down down to dumbest dust old man of oceans of all this fiery life of thine what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes aye cried stubb but sea-coal ashes -- mind ye that mr starbuck -- sea-coal not your common charcoal well well i heard ahab mutter 'here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine swears that i must play them and no others ' and damn me ahab but thou actest right live in the game and die in it chapter 119 the candles warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs the tiger of bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders gorgeous cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands so too it is that in these resplendent japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms the typhoon it will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town towards evening of that day the pequod was torn of her canvas and bare-poled was left to fight a typhoon which had struck her directly ahead when darkness came on sky and sea roared and split with the thunder and blazed with the lightning that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport holding by a shroud starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there while stubb and flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats but all their pains seemed naught though lifted to the very top of the cranes the windward quarter boat ahab's did not escape a great rolling sea dashing high up against the reeling ship's high teetering side stove in the boat's bottom at the stern and left it again all dripping through like a sieve bad work bad work mr starbuck said stubb regarding the wreck but the sea will have its way stubb for one can't fight it you see mr starbuck a wave has such a great long start before it leaps all round the world it runs and then comes the spring but as for me all the start i have to meet it is just across the deck here but never mind it's all in fun so the old song says -- sings oh jolly is the gale and a joker is the whale a' flourishin' his tail -- such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky-poky lad is the ocean oh the scud all a flyin' that's his flip only foamin' when he stirs in the spicin' -- such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky-poky lad is the ocean oh thunder splits the ships but he only smacks his lips a tastin' of this flip -- such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky-poky lad is the ocean oh avast stubb cried starbuck let the typhoon sing and strike his harp here in our rigging but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace but i am not a brave man never said i was a brave man i am a coward and i sing to keep up my spirits and i tell you what it is mr starbuck there's no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat and when that's done ten to one i sing ye the doxology for a wind-up madman look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own what how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else never mind how foolish here cried starbuck seizing stubb by the shoulder and pointing his hand towards the weather bow markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward the very course ahab is to run for moby dick the very course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is that stove in the stern-sheets man where he is wont to stand -- his stand-point is stove man now jump overboard and sing away if thou must i don't half understand ye what's in the wind yes yes round the cape of good hope is the shortest way to nantucket soliloquized starbuck suddenly heedless of stubb's question the gale that now hammers at us to stave us we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home yonder to windward all is blackness of doom but to leeward homeward -- i see it lightens up there but not with the lightning at that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness following the flashes a voice was heard at his side and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead who's there old thunder said ahab groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot-hole but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire now as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into the water but as this conductor must descend to considerable depth that its end may avoid all contact with the hull and as moreover if kept constantly towing there it would be liable to many mishaps besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging and more or less impeding the vessel's way in the water because of all this the lower parts of a ship's lightning-rods are not always overboard but are generally made in long slender links so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside or thrown down into the sea as occasion may require the rods the rods cried starbuck to the crew suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux to light ahab to his post are they overboard drop them over fore and aft quick avast cried ahab let's have fair play here though we be the weaker side yet i'll contribute to raise rods on the himmalehs and andes that all the world may be secured but out on privileges let them be sir look aloft cried starbuck the corpusants the corpusants all the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire and touched at each tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar blast the boat let it go cried stubb at this instant as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft so that its gunwale violently jammed his hand as he was passing a lashing blast it -- but slipping backward on the deck his uplifted eyes caught the flames and immediately shifting his tone he cried -- the corpusants have mercy on us all to sailors oaths are household words they will swear in the trance of the calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecate curses from the topsail-yard-arms when most they teeter over to a seething sea but in all my voyagings seldom have i heard a common oath when god's burning finger has been laid on the ship when his mene mene tekel upharsin has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage while this pallidness was burning aloft few words were heard from the enchanted crew who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence like a far away constellation of stars relieved against the ghostly light the gigantic jet negro daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come the parted mouth of tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up by the preternatural light queequeg's tattooing burned like satanic blue flames on his body the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft and once more the pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall a moment or two passed when starbuck going forward pushed against some one it was stubb what thinkest thou now man i heard thy cry it was not the same in the song no no it wasn't i said the corpusants have mercy on us all and i hope they will still but do they only have mercy on long faces -- have they no bowels for a laugh and look ye mr starbuck -- but it's too dark to look hear me then i take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a' block with sperm-oil d'ye see and so all that sperm will work up into the masts like sap in a tree yes our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles -- that's the good promise we saw at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubb's face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight glancing upwards he cried see see and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor the corpusants have mercy on us all cried stubb again at the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and the flame the parsee was kneeling in ahab's front but with his head bowed away from him while near by from the arched and overhanging rigging where they had just been engaged securing a spar a number of the seamen arrested by the glare now cohered together and hung pendulous like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping orchard twig in various enchanted attitudes like the standing or stepping or running skeletons in herculaneum others remained rooted to the deck but all their eyes upcast aye aye men cried ahab look up at it mark it well the white flame but lights the way to the white whale hand me those mainmast links there i would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it blood against fire so then turning -- the last link held fast in his left hand he put his foot upon the parsee and with fixed upward eye and high-flung right arm he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames oh thou clear spirit of clear fire whom on these seas i as persian once did worship till in the sacramental act so burned by thee that to this hour i bear the scar i now know thee thou clear spirit and i now know that thy right worship is defiance to neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind and e'en for hate thou canst but kill and all are killed no fearless fool now fronts thee i own thy speechless placeless power but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional unintegral mastery in me in the midst of the personified impersonal a personality stands here though but a point at best whencesoe'er i came wheresoe'er i go yet while i earthly live the queenly personality lives in me and feels her royal rights but war is pain and hate is woe come in thy lowest form of love and i will kneel and kiss thee but at thy highest come as mere supernal power and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds there's that in here that still remains indifferent oh thou clear spirit of thy fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire i breathe it back to thee sudden repeated flashes of lightning the nine flames leap lengthwise to thrice their previous height ahab with the rest closes his eyes his right hand pressed hard upon them i own thy speechless placeless power said i not so nor was it wrung from me nor do i now drop these links thou canst blind but i can then grope thou canst consume but i can then be ashes take the homage of these poor eyes and shutter-hands i would not take it the lightning flashes through my skull mine eye-balls ache and ache my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded and rolling on some stunning ground oh oh yet blindfold yet will i talk to thee light though thou be thou leapest out of darkness but i am darkness leaping out of light leaping out of thee the javelins cease open eyes see or not there burn the flames oh thou magnanimous now i do glory in my genealogy but thou art but my fiery father my sweet mother i know not oh cruel what hast thou done with her there lies my puzzle but thine is greater thou knowest not how came ye hence callest thyself unbegotten certainly knowest not thy beginning hence callest thyself unbegun i know that of me which thou knowest not of thyself oh thou omnipotent there is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee thou clear spirit to whom all thy eternity is but time all thy creativeness mechanical through thee thy flaming self my scorched eyes do dimly see it oh thou foundling fire thou hermit immemorial thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle thy unparticipated grief here again with haughty agony i read my sire leap leap up and lick the sky i leap with thee i burn with thee would fain be welded with thee defyingly i worship thee the boat the boat cried starbuck look at thy boat old man ahab's harpoon the one forged at perth's fire remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyond his whale-boat's bow but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale forked fire as the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent's tongue starbuck grasped ahab by the arm -- god god is against thee old man forbear 'tis an ill voyage ill begun ill continued let me square the yards while we may old man and make a fair wind of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this overhearing starbuck the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces -- though not a sail was left aloft for the moment all the aghast mate's thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half mutinous cry but dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck and snatching the burning harpoon ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope's end petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held the men fell back in dismay and ahab again spoke -- all your oaths to hunt the white whale are as binding as mine and heart soul and body lungs and life old ahab is bound and that ye may know to what tune this heart beats look ye here thus i blow out the last fear and with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame as in the hurricane that sweeps the plain men fly the neighborhood of some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts so at those last words of ahab's many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay chapter 120 the deck towards the end of the first night watch ahab standing by the helm starbuck approaching him we must send down the main-top-sail yard sir the band is working loose and the lee lift is half-stranded shall i strike it sir strike nothing lash it if i had sky-sail poles i'd sway them up now sir -- in god's name -- sir well the anchors are working sir shall i get them inboard strike nothing and stir nothing but lash everything the wind rises but it has not got up to my table-lands yet quick and see to it -- by masts and keels he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some coasting smack send down my main-top-sail yard ho gluepots loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds and this brain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud shall i strike that oh none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest time what a hooroosh aloft there i would e'en take it for sublime did i not know that the colic is a noisy malady oh take medicine take medicine chapter 121 midnight -- the forecastle bulwarks stubb and flask mounted on them and passing additional lashings over the anchors there hanging no stubb you may pound that knot there as much as you please but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying and how long ago is it since you said the very contrary didn't you once say that whatever ship ahab sails in that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward stop now didn't you say so well suppose i did what then i've part changed my flesh since that time why not my mind besides supposing we are loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this drenching spray here why my little man you have pretty red hair but you couldn't get afire now shake yourself you're aquarius or the water-bearer flask might fill pitchers at your coat collar don't you see then that for these extra risks the marine insurance companies have extra guarantees here are hydrants flask but hark again and i'll answer ye the other thing first take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here though so i can pass the rope now listen what's the mighty difference between holding a mast's lightning-rod in the storm and standing close by a mast that hasn't got any lightning-rod at all in a storm don't you see you timber-head that no harm can come to the holder of the rod unless the mast is first struck what are you talking about then not one ship in a hundred carries rods and ahab -- aye man and all of us -- were in no more danger then in my poor opinion than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas why you king-post you i suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat like a militia officer's skewered feather and trailing behind like his sash why don't ye be sensible flask it's easy to be sensible why don't ye then any man with half an eye can be sensible i don't know that stubb you sometimes find it rather hard yes when a fellow's soaked through it's hard to be sensible that's a fact and i am about drenched with this spray never mind catch the turn there and pass it seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again tying these two anchors here flask seems like tying a man's hands behind him and what big generous hands they are to be sure these are your iron fists hey what a hold they have too i wonder flask whether the world is anchored anywhere if she is she swings with an uncommon long cable though there hammer that knot down and we've done so next to touching land lighting on deck is the most satisfactory i say just wring out my jacket skirts will ye thank ye they laugh at long-togs so flask but seems to me a long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat the tails tapering down that way serve to carry off the water d'ye see same with cocked hats the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs flask no more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me i must mount a swallow-tail and drive down a beaver so halloa whew there goes my tarpaulin overboard lord lord that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly this is a nasty night lad chapter 122 midnight aloft -- thunder and lightning the main-top-sail yard -- tashtego passing new lashings around it um um um stop that thunder plenty too much thunder up here what's the use of thunder um um um we don't want thunder we want rum give us a glass of rum um um um chapter 123 the musket during the most violent shocks of the typhoon the man at the pequod's jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions even though preventer tackles had been attached to it -- for they were slack -- because some play to the tiller was indispensable in a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses at intervals go round and round it was thus with the pequod's at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion some hours after midnight the typhoon abated so much that through the strenuous exertions of starbuck and stubb -- one engaged forward and the other aft -- the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars and went eddying away to leeward like the feathers of an albatross which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed and a storm-trysail was set further aft so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again and the course -- for the present east-south-east -- which he was to steer if practicable was once more given to the helmsman for during the violence of the gale he had only steered according to its vicissitudes but as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible watching the compass meanwhile lo a good sign the wind seemed coming round astern aye the foul breeze became fair instantly the yards were squared to the lively song of ho the fair wind oh-ye-ho cheerly men the crew singing for joy that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it in compliance with the standing order of his commander -- to report immediately and at any one of the twenty-four hours any decided change in the affairs of the deck -- starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze -- however reluctantly and gloomily -- than he mechanically went below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance ere knocking at his state-room he involuntarily paused before it a moment the cabin lamp -- taking long swings this way and that -- was burning fitfully and casting fitful shadows upon the old man's bolted door -- a thin one with fixed blinds inserted in place of upper panels the isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements the loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead starbuck was an honest upright man but out of starbuck's heart at that instant when he saw the muskets there strangely evolved an evil thought but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself he would have shot me once he murmured yes there's the very musket that he pointed at me -- that one with the studded stock let me touch it -- lift it strange that i who have handled so many deadly lances strange that i should shake so now loaded i must see aye aye and powder in the pan -- that's not good best spill it -- wait i'll cure myself of this i'll hold the musket boldly while i think -- i come to report a fair wind to him but how fair fair for death and doom -- that's fair for moby dick it's a fair wind that's only fair for that accursed fish -- the very tube he pointed at me -- the very one this one -- i hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing i handle now -- aye and he would fain kill all his crew does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant and in these same perilous seas gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log and in this very typhoon did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods but shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship's company down to doom with him -- yes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my soul swears this ship will if ahab have his way if then he were this instant -- put aside that crime would not be his ha is he muttering in his sleep yes just there -- in there he's sleeping sleeping aye but still alive and soon awake again i can't withstand thee then old man not reasoning not remonstrance not entreaty wilt thou hearken to all this thou scornest flat obedience to thy own flat commands this is all thou breathest aye and say'st the men have vow'd thy vow say'st all of us are ahabs great god forbid -- but is there no other way no lawful way -- make him a prisoner to be taken home what hope to wrest this old man's living power from his own living hands only a fool would try it say he were pinioned even knotted all over with ropes and hawsers chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor he would be more hideous than a caged tiger then i could not endure the sight could not possibly fly his howlings all comfort sleep itself inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage what then remains the land is hundreds of leagues away and locked japan the nearest i stand alone here upon an open sea with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law -- aye aye 'tis so -- is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed tindering sheets and skin together -- and would i be a murderer then if -- and slowly stealthily and half sideways looking he placed the loaded musket's end against the door on this level ahab's hammock swings within his head this way a touch and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again -- oh mary mary -- boy boy boy -- but if i wake thee not to death old man who can tell to what unsounded deeps starbuck's body this day week may sink with all the crew great god where art thou shall i shall i -- the wind has gone down and shifted sir the fore and main topsails are reefed and set she heads her course stern all oh moby dick i clutch thy heart at last such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man's tormented sleep as if starbuck's voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak the yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard's arm against the panel starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel but turning from the door he placed the death-tube in its rack and left the place he's too sound asleep mr stubb go thou down and wake him and tell him i must see to the deck here thou know'st what to say chapter 124 the needle next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk and striving in the pequod's gurgling track pushed her on like giants' palms outspread the strong unstaggering breeze abounded so that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails the whole world boomed before the wind muffled in the full morning light the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks emblazonings as of crowned babylonian kings and queens reigned over everything the sea was as a crucible of molten gold that bubblingly leaps with light and heat long maintaining an enchanted silence ahab stood apart and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright sun's rays produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the sun's rearward place and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake ha ha my ship thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of the sun ho ho all ye nations before my prow i bring the sun to ye yoke on the further billows hallo a tandem i drive the sea but suddenly reined back by some counter thought he hurried towards the helm huskily demanding how the ship was heading east-sou-east sir said the frightened steersman thou liest smiting him with his clenched fist heading east at this hour in the morning and the sun astern upon this every soul was confounded for the phenomenon just then observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause thrusting his head half way into the binnacle ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses his uplifted arm slowly fell for a moment he almost seemed to stagger standing behind him starbuck looked and lo the two compasses pointed east and the pequod was as infallibly going west but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed i have it it has happened before mr starbuck last night's thunder turned our compasses -- that's all thou hast before now heard of such a thing i take it aye but never before has it happened to me sir said the pale mate gloomily here it must needs be said that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms the magnetic energy as developed in the mariner's needle is as all know essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much marvelled at that such things should be instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal all its loadstone virtue being annihilated so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife's knitting needle but in either case the needle never again of itself recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost and if the binnacle compasses be affected the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed compasses the old man with the sharp of his extended hand now took the precise bearing of the sun and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted shouted out his orders for the ship's course to be changed accordingly the yards were hard up and once more the pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her meanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts starbuck said nothing but quietly he issued all requisite orders while stubb and flask -- who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings -- likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced as for the men though some of them lowly rumbled their fear of ahab was greater than their fear of fate but as ever before the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed or if impressed it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible ahab's for a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries but chancing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed copper sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck thou poor proud heaven-gazer and sun's pilot yesterday i wrecked thee and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me so so but ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet mr starbuck -- a lance without a pole a top-maul and the smallest of the sail-maker's needles quick accessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do were certain prudential motives whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses besides the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles though clumsily practicable was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors without some shudderings and evil portents men said he steadily turning upon the crew as the mate handed him the things he had demanded my men the thunder turned old ahab's needles but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own that will point as true as any abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors as this was said and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow but starbuck looked away with a blow from the top-maul ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade him hold it upright without its touching the deck then with the maul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly hammered that several times the mate still holding the rod as before then going through some small strange motions with it -- whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew is uncertain -- he called for linen thread and moving to the binnacle slipped out the two reversed needles there and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle over one of the compass-cards at first the steel went round and round quivering and vibrating at either end but at last it settled to its place when ahab who had been intently watching for this result stepped frankly back from the binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimed -- look ye for yourselves if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone the sun is east and that compass swears it one after another they peered in for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs and one after another they slunk away in his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph you then saw ahab in all his fatal pride chapter 125 the log and line while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage the log and line had but very seldom been in use owing to a confident reliance upon other means of determining the vessel's place some merchantmen and many whalemen especially when cruising wholly neglect to heave the log though at the same time and frequently more for form's sake than anything else regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship as well as the presumed average rate of progression every hour it had been thus with the pequod the wooden reel and angular log attached hung long untouched just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks rains and spray had damped it sun and wind had warped it all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly but heedless of all this his mood seized ahab as he happened to glance upon the reel not many hours after the magnet scene and he remembered how his quadrant was no more and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line the ship was sailing plungingly astern the billows rolled in riots forward there heave the log two seamen came the golden-hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman take the reel one of ye i'll heave they went towards the extreme stern on the ship's lee side where the deck with the oblique energy of the wind was now almost dipping into the creamy sidelong-rushing sea the manxman took the reel and holding it high up by the projecting handle-ends of the spindle round which the spool of line revolved so stood with the angular log hanging downwards till ahab advanced to him ahab stood before him and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard when the old manxman who was intently eyeing both him and the line made bold to speak sir i mistrust it this line looks far gone long heat and wet have spoiled it 'twill hold old gentleman long heat and wet have they spoiled thee thou seem'st to hold or truer perhaps life holds thee not thou it i hold the spool sir but just as my captain says with these grey hairs of mine 'tis not worth while disputing 'specially with a superior who'll ne'er confess what's that there now's a patched professor in queen nature's granite-founded college but methinks he's too subservient where wert thou born in the little rocky isle of man sir excellent thou'st hit the world by that i know not sir but i was born there in the isle of man hey well the other way it's good here's a man from man a man born in once independent man and now unmanned of man which is sucked in -- by what up with the reel the dead blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last up with it so the log was heaved the loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern and then instantly the reel began to whirl in turn jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely hold hard snap the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon the tugging log was gone i crush the quadrant the thunder turns the needles and now the mad sea parts the log-line but ahab can mend all haul in here tahitian reel up manxman and look ye let the carpenter make another log and mend thou the line see to it there he goes now to him nothing's happened but to me the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world haul in haul in tahitian these lines run whole and whirling out come in broken and dragging slow ha pip come to help eh pip pip whom call ye pip pip jumped from the whale-boat pip's missing let's see now if ye haven't fished him up here fisherman it drags hard i guess he's holding on jerk him tahiti jerk him off we haul in no cowards here ho there's his arm just breaking water a hatchet a hatchet cut it off -- we haul in no cowards here captain ahab sir sir here's pip trying to get on board again peace thou crazy loon cried the manxman seizing him by the arm away from the quarter-deck the greater idiot ever scolds the lesser muttered ahab advancing hands off from that holiness where sayest thou pip was boy astern there sir astern lo lo and who art thou boy i see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes oh god that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through who art thou boy bell-boy sir ship's-crier ding dong ding pip pip pip one hundred pounds of clay reward for pip five feet high -- looks cowardly -- quickest known by that ding dong ding who's seen pip the coward there can be no hearts above the snow-line oh ye frozen heavens look down here ye did beget this luckless child and have abandoned him ye creative libertines here boy ahab's cabin shall be pip's home henceforth while ahab lives thou touchest my inmost centre boy thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings come let's down what's this here's velvet shark-skin intently gazing at ahab's hand and feeling it ah now had poor pip but felt so kind a thing as this perhaps he had ne'er been lost this seems to me sir as a man-rope something that weak souls may hold by oh sir let old perth now come and rivet these two hands together the black one with the white for i will not let this go oh boy nor will i thee unless i should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here come then to my cabin lo ye believers in gods all goodness and in man all ill lo you see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man and man though idiotic and knowing not what he does yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude come i feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand than though i grasped an emperor's there go two daft ones now muttered the old manxman one daft with strength the other daft with weakness but here's the end of the rotten line -- all dripping too mend it eh i think we had best have a new line altogether i'll see mr stubb about it chapter 126 the life-buoy steering now south-eastward by ahab's levelled steel and her progress solely determined by ahab's level log and line the pequod held on her path towards the equator making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere long sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds over waves monotonously mild all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene at last when the ship drew near to the outskirts as it were of the equatorial fishing-ground and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets the watch -- then headed by flask -- was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly -- like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all herod's murdered innocents -- that one and all they started from their reveries and for the space of some moments stood or sat or leaned all transfixedly listening like the carved roman slave while that wild cry remained within hearing the christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids and shuddered but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled yet the grey manxman -- the oldest mariner of all -- declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea below in his hammock ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when he came to the deck it was then recounted to him by flask not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings he hollowly laughed and thus explained the wonder those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams or some dams that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail but this only the more affected some of them because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress but also from the human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside in the sea under certain circumstances seals have more than once been mistaken for men but the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning at sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether it was thus with the man there is now no telling but be that as it may he had not been long at his perch when a cry was heard -- a cry and a rushing -- and looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air and looking down a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea the life-buoy -- a long slender cask -- was dropped from the stern where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose to seize it and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken so that it slowly filled and that parched wood also filled at its every pore and the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom as if to yield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard one and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the white whale on the white whale's own peculiar ground that man was swallowed up in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at the time indeed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at least as a portent for they regarded it not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged they declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before but again the old manxman said nay the lost life-buoy was now to be replaced starbuck was directed to see to it but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end whatever that might prove to be therefore they were going to leave the ship's stern unprovided with a buoy when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin a life-buoy of a coffin cried starbuck starting rather queer that i should say said stubb it will make a good enough one said flask the carpenter here can arrange it easily bring it up there's nothing else for it said starbuck after a melancholy pause rig it carpenter do not look at me so -- the coffin i mean dost thou hear me rig it and shall i nail down the lid sir moving his hand as with a hammer aye and shall i caulk the seams sir moving his hand as with a caulking-iron aye and shall i then pay over the same with pitch sir moving his hand as with a pitch-pot away what possesses thee to this make a life-buoy of the coffin and no more -- mr stubb mr flask come forward with me he goes off in a huff the whole he can endure at the parts he baulks now i don't like this i make a leg for captain ahab and he wears it like a gentleman but i make a bandbox for queequeg and he won't put his head into it are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin and now i'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it it's like turning an old coat going to bring the flesh on the other side now i don't like this cobbling sort of business -- i don't like it at all it's undignified it's not my place let tinkers' brats do tinkerings we are their betters i like to take in hand none but clean virgin fair-and-square mathematical jobs something that regularly begins at the beginning and is at the middle when midway and comes to an end at the conclusion not a cobbler's job that's at an end in the middle and at the beginning at the end it's the old woman's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs lord what an affection all old women have for tinkers i know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once and that's the reason i never would work for lonely widow old women ashore when i kept my job-shop in the vineyard they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me but heigh-ho there are no caps at sea but snow-caps let me see nail down the lid caulk the seams pay over the same with pitch batten them down tight and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship's stern were ever such things done before with a coffin some superstitious old carpenters now would be tied up in the rigging ere they would do the job but i'm made of knotty aroostook hemlock i don't budge cruppered with a coffin sailing about with a grave-yard tray but never mind we workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables as well as coffins and hearses we work by the month or by the job or by the profit not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work unless it be too confounded cobbling and then we stash it if we can hem i'll do the job now tenderly i'll have me -- let's see -- how many in the ship's company all told but i've forgotten any way i'll have me thirty separate turk's-headed life-lines each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin then if the hull go down there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin a sight not seen very often beneath the sun come hammer caulking-iron pitch-pot and marling-spike let's to it chapter 127 the deck the coffin laid upon two line-tubs between the vice-bench and the open hatchway the carpenter caulking its seams the string of twisted oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frock -- ahab comes slowly from the cabin-gangway and hears pip following him back lad i will be with ye again presently he goes not this hand complies with my humor more genially than that boy -- middle aisle of a church what's here life-buoy sir mr starbuck's orders oh look sir beware the hatchway thank ye man thy coffin lies handy to the vault sir the hatchway oh so it does sir so it does art not thou the leg-maker look did not this stump come from thy shop i believe it did sir does the ferrule stand sir well enough but art thou not also the undertaker aye sir i patched up this thing here as a coffin for queequeg but they've set me now to turning it into something else then tell me art thou not an arrant all-grasping intermeddling monopolising heathenish old scamp to be one day making legs and the next day coffins to clap them in and yet again life-buoys out of those same coffins thou art as unprincipled as the gods and as much of a jack-of-all-trades but i do not mean anything sir i do as i do the gods again hark ye dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin the titans they say hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes and the grave-digger in the play sings spade in hand dost thou never sing sir do i sing oh i'm indifferent enough sir for that but the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there was none in his spade sir but the caulking mallet is full of it hark to it aye and that's because the lid there's a sounding-board and what in all things makes the sounding-board is this -- there's naught beneath and yet a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same carpenter hast thou ever helped carry a bier and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate going in faith sir i've -- faith what's that why faith sir it's only a sort of exclamation-like -- that's all sir um um go on i was about to say sir that -- art thou a silk-worm dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself look at thy bosom despatch and get these traps out of sight he goes aft that was sudden now but squalls come sudden in hot latitudes i've heard that the isle of albemarle one of the gallipagos is cut by the equator right in the middle seems to me some sort of equator cuts yon old man too right in his middle he's always under the line -- fiery hot i tell ye he's looking this way -- come oakum quick here we go again this wooden mallet is the cork and i'm the professor of musical glasses -- tap tap ahab to himself there's a sight there's a sound the grey-headed woodpecker tapping the hollow tree blind and dumb might well be envied now see that thing rests on two line-tubs full of tow-lines a most malicious wag that fellow rat-tat so man's seconds tick oh how immaterial are all materials what things real are there but imponderable thoughts here now's the very dreaded symbol of grim death by a mere hap made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life a life-buoy of a coffin does it go further can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is after all but an immortality-preserver i'll think of that but no so far gone am i in the dark side of earth that its other side the theoretic bright one seems but uncertain twilight to me will ye never have done carpenter with that accursed sound i go below let me not see that thing here when i return again now then pip we'll talk this over i do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee chapter 128 the pequod meets the rachel next day a large ship the rachel was descried bearing directly down upon the pequod all her spars thickly clustering with men at the time the pequod was making good speed through the water but as the broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst and all life fled from the smitten hull bad news she brings bad news muttered the old manxman but ere her commander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in his boat ere he could hopefully hail ahab's voice was heard hast seen the white whale aye yesterday have ye seen a whale-boat adrift throttling his joy ahab negatively answered this unexpected question and would then have fain boarded the stranger when the stranger captain himself having stopped his vessel's way was seen descending her side a few keen pulls and his boat-hook soon clinched the pequod's main-chains and he sprang to the deck immediately he was recognised by ahab for a nantucketer he knew but no formal salutation was exchanged where was he -- not killed -- not killed cried ahab closely advancing how was it it seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous while three of the stranger's boats were engaged with a shoal of whales which had led them some four or five miles from the ship and while they were yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head of moby dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water not very far to leeward whereupon the fourth rigged boat -- a reserved one -- had been instantly lowered in chase after a keen sail before the wind this fourth boat -- the swiftest keeled of all -- seemed to have succeeded in fastening -- at least as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it in the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water and after that nothing more whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers as often happens there was some apprehension but no positive alarm as yet the recall signals were placed in the rigging darkness came on and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats -- ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction -- the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight but for the time to increase her distance from it but the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard she crowded all sail -- stunsail on stunsail -- after the missing boat kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon and every other man aloft on the look-out but though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her and not finding anything had again dashed on again paused and lowered her boats and though she had thus continued doing till daylight yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen the story told the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the pequod he desired that ship to unite with his own in the search by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart on parallel lines and so sweeping a double horizon as it were i will wager something now whispered stubb to flask that some one in that missing boat wore off that captain's best coat mayhap his watch -- he's so cursed anxious to get it back who ever heard of two pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height of the whaling season see flask only see how pale he looks -- pale in the very buttons of his eyes -- look -- it wasn't the coat -- it must have been the -- my boy my own boy is among them for god's sake -- i beg i conjure -- here exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab who thus far had but icily received his petition for eight-and-forty hours let me charter your ship -- i will gladly pay for it and roundly pay for it -- if there be no other way -- for eight-and-forty hours only -- only that -- you must oh you must and you shall do this thing his son cried stubb oh it's his son he's lost i take back the coat and watch -- what says ahab we must save that boy he's drowned with the rest on 'em last night said the old manx sailor standing behind them i heard all of ye heard their spirits now as it shortly turned out what made this incident of the rachel's the more melancholy was the circumstance that not only was one of the captain's sons among the number of the missing boat's crew but among the number of the other boat's crews at the same time but on the other hand separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase there had been still another son as that for a time the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity which was only solved for him by his chief mate's instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies that is when placed between jeopardized but divided boats always to pick up the majority first but the captain for some unknown constitutional reason had refrained from mentioning all this and not till forced to it by ahab's iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy a little lad but twelve years old whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a nantucketer's paternal love had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race nor does it unfrequently occur that nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them for a protracted three or four years' voyage in some other ship than their own so that their first knowledge of a whaleman's career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father's natural but untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern meantime now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahab and ahab still stood like an anvil receiving every shock but without the least quivering of his own i will not go said the stranger till you say aye to me do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case for you too have a boy captain ahab -- though but a child and nestling safely at home now -- a child of your old age too -- yes yes you relent i see it -- run run men now and stand by to square in the yards avast cried ahab -- touch not a rope-yarn then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every word -- captain gardiner i will not do it even now i lose time good-bye good-bye god bless ye man and may i forgive myself but i must go mr starbuck look at the binnacle watch and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers then brace forward again and let the ship sail as before hurriedly turning with averted face he descended into his cabin leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit but starting from his enchantment gardiner silently hurried to the side more fell than stepped into his boat and returned to his ship soon the two ships diverged their wakes and long as the strange vessel was in view she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot however small on the sea this way and that her yards were swung round starboard and larboard she continued to tack now she beat against a head sea and again it pushed her before it while all the while her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men as three tall cherry trees when the boys are cherrying among the boughs but by her still halting course and winding woeful way you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray still remained without comfort she was rachel weeping for her children because they were not chapter 129 the cabin ahab moving to go on deck pip catches him by the hand to follow lad lad i tell thee thou must not follow ahab now the hour is coming when ahab would not scare thee from him yet would not have thee by him there is that in thee poor lad which i feel too curing to my malady like cures like and for this hunt my malady becomes my most desired health do thou abide below here where they shall serve thee as if thou wert the captain aye lad thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair another screw to it thou must be no no no ye have not a whole body sir do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg only tread upon me sir i ask no more so i remain a part of ye oh spite of million villains this makes me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity of man -- and a black and crazy -- but methinks like-cures-like applies to him too he grows so sane again they tell me sir that stubb did once desert poor little pip whose drowned bones now show white for all the blackness of his living skin but i will never desert ye sir as stubb did him sir i must go with ye if thou speakest thus to me much more ahab's purpose keels up in him i tell thee no it cannot be oh good master master master weep so and i will murder thee have a care for ahab too is mad listen and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck and still know that i am there and now i quit thee thy hand -- met true art thou lad as the circumference to its centre so god for ever bless thee and if it come to that -- god for ever save thee let what will befall ahab goes pip steps one step forward here he this instant stood i stand in his air -- but i'm alone now were even poor pip here i could endure it but he's missing pip pip ding dong ding who's seen pip he must be up here let's try the door what neither lock nor bolt nor bar and yet there's no opening it it must be the spell he told me to stay here aye and told me this screwed chair was mine here then i'll seat me against the transom in the ship's full middle all her keel and her three masts before me here our old sailors say in their black seventy-fours great admirals sometimes sit at table and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants ha what's this epaulets epaulets the epaulets all come crowding pass round the decanters glad to see ye fill up monsieurs what an odd feeling now when a black boy's host to white men with gold lace upon their coats -- monsieurs have ye seen one pip -- a little negro lad five feet high hang-dog look and cowardly jumped from a whale-boat once -- seen him no well then fill up again captains and let's drink shame upon all cowards i name no names shame upon them put one foot upon the table shame upon all cowards -- hist above there i hear ivory -- oh master master i am indeed down-hearted when you walk over me but here i'll stay though this stern strikes rocks and they bulge through and oysters come to join me chapter 130 the hat and now that at the proper time and place after so long and wide a preliminary cruise ahab -- all other whaling waters swept -- seemed to have chased his foe into an ocean-fold to slay him the more securely there now that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered moby dick -- and now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters whether sinning or sinned against now it was that there lurked a something in the old man's eyes which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see as the unsetting polar star which through the livelong arctic six months' night sustains its piercing steady central gaze so ahab's purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew it domineered above them so that all their bodings doubts misgivings fears were fain to hide beneath their souls and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf in this foreshadowing interval too all humor forced or natural vanished stubb no more strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove to check one alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seemed ground to finest dust and powdered for the time in the clamped mortar of ahab's iron soul like machines they dumbly moved about the deck ever conscious that the old man's despot eye was on them but did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours when he thought no glance but one was on him then you would have seen that even as ahab's eyes so awed the crew's the inscrutable parsee's glance awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at times affected it such an added gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah now such ceaseless shudderings shook him that the men looked dubious at him half uncertain as it seemed whether indeed he were a mortal substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being's body and that shadow was always hovering there for not by night even had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber or go below he would stand still for hours but never sat or leaned his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say -- we two watchmen never rest nor at any time by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck unless ahab was before them either standing in his pivot-hole or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits -- the main-mast and the mizen or else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle -- his living foot advanced upon the deck as if to step his hat slouched heavily over his eyes so that however motionless he stood however the days and nights were added on that he had not swung in his hammock yet hidden beneath that slouching hat they could never tell unerringly whether for all this his eyes were really closed at times or whether he was still intently scanning them no matter though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat the clothes that the night had wet the next day's sunshine dried upon him and so day after day and night after night he went no more beneath the planks whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for he ate in the same open air that is his two only meals -- breakfast and dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard which darkly grew all gnarled as unearthed roots of trees blown over which still grow idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure but though his whole life was now become one watch on deck and though the parsee's mystic watch was without intermission as his own yet these two never seemed to speak -- one man to the other -- unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain openly and to the awe-struck crew they seemed pole-like asunder if by day they chanced to speak one word by night dumb men were both so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange at times for longest hours without a single hail they stood far parted in the starlight ahab in his scuttle the parsee by the mainmast but still fixedly gazing upon each other as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow in ahab the parsee his abandoned substance and yet somehow did ahab -- in his own proper self as daily hourly and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinates -- ahab seemed an independent lord the parsee but his slave still again both seemed yoked together and an unseen tyrant driving them the lean shade siding the solid rib for be this parsee what he may all rib and keel was solid ahab at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn his iron voice was heard from aft -- man the mast-heads -- and all through the day till after sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of the helmsman's bell was heard -- what d'ye see -- sharp sharp but when three or four days had slided by after meeting the children-seeking rachel and no spout had yet been seen the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew's fidelity at least of nearly all except the pagan harpooneers he seemed to doubt even whether stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought but if these suspicions were really his he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them however his actions might seem to hint them i will have the first sight of the whale myself -- he said aye ahab must have the doubloon and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines and sending a hand aloft with a single sheaved block to secure to the main-mast head he received the two ends of the downward-reeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end in order to fasten it at the rail this done with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round upon his crew sweeping from one to the other pausing his glance long upon daggoo queequeg tashtego but shunning fedallah and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate said -- take the rope sir -- i give it into thy hands starbuck then arranging his person in the basket he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last and afterwards stood near it and thus with one hand clinging round the royal mast ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles -- ahead astern this side and that -- within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging which chances to afford no foothold the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope under these circumstances its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it because in such a wilderness of running rigging whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings it would be but a natural fatality if unprovided with a constant watchman the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea so ahab's proceedings in this matter were not unusual the only strange thing about them seemed to be that starbuck almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision -- one of those too whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat -- it was strange that this was the very man he should select for his watchman freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's hands now the first time ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there ten minutes one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these latitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air then spiralized downwards and went eddying again round his head but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight your hat your hat sir suddenly cried the sicilian seaman who being posted at the mizen-mast-head stood directly behind ahab though somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing them but already the sable wing was before the old man's eyes the long hooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk darted away with his prize an eagle flew thrice round tarquin's head removing his cap to replace it and thereupon tanaquil his wife declared that tarquin would be king of rome but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good ahab's hat was never restored the wild hawk flew on and on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot was dimly discerned falling from that vast height into the sea chapter 131 the pequod meets the delight the intense pequod sailed on the rolling waves and days went by the life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung and another ship most miserably misnamed the delight was descried as she drew nigh all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams called shears which in some whaling-ships cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet serving to carry the spare unrigged or disabled boats upon the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered white ribs and some few splintered planks of what had once been a whale-boat but you now saw through this wreck as plainly as you see through the peeled half-unhinged and bleaching skeleton of a horse hast seen the white whale look replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck hast killed him the harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that answered the other sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together not forged and snatching perth's levelled iron from the crotch ahab held it out exclaiming -- look ye nantucketer here in this hand i hold his death tempered in blood and tempered by lightning are these barbs and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin where the white whale most feels his accursed life then god keep thee old man -- see'st thou that -- pointing to the hammock -- i bury but one of five stout men who were alive only yesterday but were dead ere night only that one i bury the rest were buried before they died you sail upon their tomb then turning to his crew -- are ye ready there place the plank then on the rail and lift the body so then -- oh god -- advancing towards the hammock with uplifted hands -- may the resurrection and the life -- brace forward up helm cried ahab like lightning to his men but the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea not so quick indeed but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism as ahab now glided from the dejected delight the strange life-buoy hanging at the pequod's stern came into conspicuous relief ha yonder look yonder men cried a foreboding voice in her wake in vain oh ye strangers ye fly our sad burial ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin chapter 132 the symphony it was a clear steel-blue day the firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all-pervading azure only the pensive air was transparently pure and soft with a woman's look and the robust and man-like sea heaved with long strong lingering swells as samson's chest in his sleep hither and thither on high glided the snow-white wings of small unspeckled birds these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air but to and fro in the deeps far down in the bottomless blue rushed mighty leviathans sword-fish and sharks and these were the strong troubled murderous thinkings of the masculine sea but though thus contrasting within the contrast was only in shades and shadows without those two seemed one it was only the sex as it were that distinguished them aloft like a royal czar and king the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom and at the girdling line of the horizon a soft and tremulous motion -- most seen here at the equator -- denoted the fond throbbing trust the loving alarms with which the poor bride gave her bosom away tied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with wrinkles haggardly firm and unyielding his eyes glowing like coals that still glow in the ashes of ruin untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl's forehead of heaven oh immortal infancy and innocency of the azure invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us sweet childhood of air and sky how oblivious were ye of old ahab's close-coiled woe but so have i seen little miriam and martha laughing-eyed elves heedlessly gambol around their old sire sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity but the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel for a moment the cankerous thing in his soul that glad happy air that winsome sky did at last stroke and caress him the step-mother world so long cruel -- forbidding -- now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck and did seem to joyously sob over him as if over one that however wilful and erring she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into the sea nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop starbuck saw the old man saw him how he heavily leaned over the side and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around careful not to touch him or be noticed by him he yet drew near to him and stood there ahab turned starbuck sir oh starbuck it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky on such a day -- very much such a sweetness as this -- i struck my first whale -- a boy-harpooneer of eighteen forty -- forty -- forty years ago -- ago forty years of continual whaling forty years of privation and peril and storm-time forty years on the pitiless sea for forty years has ahab forsaken the peaceful land for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep aye and yes starbuck out of those forty years i have not spent three ashore when i think of this life i have led the desolation of solitude it has been the masoned walled-town of a captain's exclusiveness which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without -- oh weariness heaviness guinea-coast slavery of solitary command -- when i think of all this only half-suspected not so keenly known to me before -- and how for forty years i have fed upon dry salted fare -- fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil -- when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand and broken the world's fresh bread to my mouldy crusts -- away whole oceans away from that young girl-wife i wedded past fifty and sailed for cape horn the next day leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow -- wife wife -- rather a widow with her husband alive aye i widowed that poor girl when i married her starbuck and then the madness the frenzy the boiling blood and the smoking brow with which for a thousand lowerings old ahab has furiously foamingly chased his prey -- more a demon than a man -- aye aye what a forty years' fool -- fool -- old fool has old ahab been why this strife of the chase why weary and palsy the arm at the oar and the iron and the lance how the richer or better is ahab now behold oh starbuck is it not hard that with this weary load i bear one poor leg should have been snatched from under me here brush this old hair aside it blinds me that i seem to weep locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes but do i look very old so very very old starbuck i feel deadly faint bowed and humped as though i were adam staggering beneath the piled centuries since paradise god god god -- crack my heart -- stave my brain -- mockery mockery bitter biting mockery of grey hairs have i lived enough joy to wear ye and seem and feel thus intolerably old close stand close to me starbuck let me look into a human eye it is better than to gaze into sea or sky better than to gaze upon god by the green land by the bright hearth-stone this is the magic glass man i see my wife and my child in thine eye no no stay on board on board -- lower not when i do when branded ahab gives chase to moby dick that hazard shall not be thine no no not with the far away home i see in that eye oh my captain my captain noble soul grand old heart after all why should any one give chase to that hated fish away with me let us fly these deadly waters let us home wife and child too are starbuck's -- wife and child of his brotherly sisterly play-fellow youth even as thine sir are the wife and child of thy loving longing paternal old age away let us away -- this instant let me alter the course how cheerily how hilariously o my captain would we bowl on our way to see old nantucket again i think sir they have some such mild blue days even as this in nantucket they have they have i have seen them -- some summer days in the morning about this time -- yes it is his noon nap now -- the boy vivaciously wakes sits up in bed and his mother tells him of me of cannibal old me how i am abroad upon the deep but will yet come back to dance him again 'tis my mary my mary herself she promised that my boy every morning should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father's sail yes yes no more it is done we head for nantucket come my captain study out the course and let us away see see the boy's face from the window the boy's hand on the hill but ahab's glance was averted like a blighted fruit tree he shook and cast his last cindered apple to the soil what is it what nameless inscrutable unearthly thing is it what cozening hidden lord and master and cruel remorseless emperor commands me that against all natural lovings and longings i so keep pushing and crowding and jamming myself on all the time recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper natural heart i durst not so much as dare is ahab ahab is it i god or who that lifts this arm but if the great sun move not of himself but is as an errand-boy in heaven nor one single star can revolve but by some invisible power how then can this one small heart beat this one small brain think thoughts unless god does that beating does that thinking does that living and not i by heaven man we are turned round and round in this world like yonder windlass and fate is the handspike and all the time lo that smiling sky and this unsounded sea look see yon albicore who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish where do murderers go man who's to doom when the judge himself is dragged to the bar but it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky and the air smells now as if it blew from a far-away meadow they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the andes starbuck and the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay sleeping aye toil we how we may we all sleep at last on the field sleep aye and rust amid greenness as last year's scythes flung down and left in the half-cut swaths -- starbuck but blanched to a corpse's hue with despair the mate had stolen away ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side but started at two reflected fixed eyes in the water there fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail chapter 133 the chase -- first day that night in the mid-watch when the old man -- as his wont at intervals -- stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned and went to his pivot-hole he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle he declared that a whale must be near soon that peculiar odor sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale was palpable to all the watch nor was any mariner surprised when after inspecting the compass and then the dog-vane and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible ahab rapidly ordered the ship's course to be slightly altered and the sail to be shortened the acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead smooth as oil and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it the polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream man the mast-heads call all hands thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands what d'ye see cried ahab flattening his face to the sky nothing nothing sir was the sound hailing down in reply t'gallant sails -- stunsails alow and aloft and on both sides all sail being set he now cast loose the life-line reserved for swaying him to the main royal-mast head and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither when while but two thirds of the way aloft and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail he raised a gull-like cry in the air there she blows -- there she blows a hump like a snow-hill it is moby dick fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look-outs the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing ahab had now gained his final perch some feet above the other look-outs tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast so that the indian's head was almost on a level with ahab's heel from this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air to the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans and did none of ye see it before cried ahab hailing the perched men all around him i saw him almost that same instant sir that captain ahab did and i cried out said tashtego not the same instant not the same -- no the doubloon is mine fate reserved the doubloon for me i only none of ye could have raised the white whale first there she blows -- there she blows -- there she blows there again -- there again he cried in long-drawn lingering methodic tones attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale's visible jets he's going to sound in stunsails down top-gallant-sails stand by three boats mr starbuck remember stay on board and keep the ship helm there luff luff a point so steady man steady there go flukes no no only black water all ready the boats there stand by stand by lower me mr starbuck lower lower -- quick quicker and he slid through the air to the deck he is heading straight to leeward sir cried stubb right away from us cannot have seen the ship yet be dumb man stand by the braces hard down the helm -- brace up shiver her -- shiver her -- so well that boats boats soon all the boats but starbuck's were dropped all the boat-sails set -- all the paddles plying with rippling swiftness shooting to leeward and ahab heading the onset a pale death-glimmer lit up fedallah's sunken eyes a hideous motion gnawed his mouth like noiseless nautilus shells their light prows sped through the sea but only slowly they neared the foe as they neared him the ocean grew still more smooth seemed drawing a carpet over its waves seemed a noon-meadow so serenely it spread at length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing and continually set in a revolving ring of finest fleecy greenish foam he saw the vast involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond before it far out on the soft turkish-rugged waters went the glistening white shadow from his broad milky forehead a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade and behind the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side but these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea alternate with their fitful flight and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish silently perched and rocked on this pole the long tail feathers streaming like pennons a gentle joyousness -- a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invested the gliding whale not the white bull jupiter swimming away with ravished europa clinging to his graceful horns his lovely leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness rippling straight for the nuptial bower in crete not jove not that great majesty supreme did surpass the glorified white whale as he so divinely swam on each soft side -- coincident with the parted swell that but once leaving him then flowed so wide away -- on each bright side the whale shed off enticings no wonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity had ventured to assail it but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes yet calm enticing calm oh whale thou glidest on to all who for the first time eye thee no matter how many in that same way thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed before and thus through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture moby dick moved on still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch like virginia's natural bridge and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air the grand god revealed himself sounded and went out of sight hoveringly halting and dipping on the wing the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left with oars apeak and paddles down the sheets of their sails adrift the three boats now stilly floated awaiting moby dick's reappearance an hour said ahab standing rooted in his boat's stern and he gazed beyond the whale's place towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward it was only an instant for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle the breeze now freshened the sea began to swell the birds -- the birds cried tashtego in long indian file as when herons take wing the white birds were now all flying towards ahab's boat and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyous expectant cries their vision was keener than man's ahab could discover no sign in the sea but suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as it rose till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white glistening teeth floating up from the undiscoverable bottom it was moby dick's open mouth and scrolled jaw his vast shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea the glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition then calling upon fedallah to change places with him went forward to the bows and seizing perth's harpoon commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern now by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis its bow by anticipation was made to face the whale's head while yet under water but as if perceiving this stratagem moby dick with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplanted himself as it were in an instant shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat through and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for an instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock the bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahab's head and reached higher than that in this attitude the white whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse with unastonished eyes fedallah gazed and crossed his arms but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to gain the uttermost stern and now while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from his body being submerged beneath the boat he could not be darted at from the bows for the bows were almost inside of him as it were and while the other boats involuntarily paused as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand then it was that monomaniac ahab furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated frenzied with all this he seized the long bone with his naked hands and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe as now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the frail gunwales bent in collapsed and snapped as both jaws like an enormous shears sliding further aft bit the craft completely in twain and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between the two floating wrecks these floated aside the broken ends drooping the crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across at that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped ahab the first to perceive the whale's intent by the crafty upraising of his head a movement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite but only slipping further into the whale's mouth and tilting over sideways as it slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw spilled him out of it as he leaned to the push and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea ripplingly withdrawing from his prey moby dick now lay at a little distance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose -- some twenty or more feet out of the water -- the now rising swells with all their confluent waves dazzlingly broke against it vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air so in a gale the but half baffled channel billows only recoil from the base of the eddystone triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale it receives its designation pitchpoling from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down poise of the whale-lance in the exercise called pitchpoling previously described by this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him but soon resuming his horizontal attitude moby dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before antiochus's elephants in the book of maccabees meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale's insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swim -- though he could still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that helpless ahab's head was seen like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst from the boat's fragmentary stern fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him the clinging crew at the other drifting end could not succor him more than enough was it for them to look to themselves for so revolvingly appalling was the white whale's aspect and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them and though the other boats unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways ahab and all nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape with straining eyes then they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre had now become the old man's head meantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship's mast heads and squaring her yards she had borne down upon the scene and was now so nigh that ahab in the water hailed her -- sail on the -- but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick and whelmed him for the time but struggling out of it again and chancing to rise on a towering crest he shouted -- sail on the whale -- drive him off the pequod's prows were pointed and breaking up the charmed circle she effectually parted the white whale from his victim as he sullenly swam off the boats flew to the rescue dragged into stubb's boat with blood-shot blinded eyes the white brine caking in his wrinkles the long tension of ahab's bodily strength did crack and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom for a time lying all crushed in the bottom of stubb's boat like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants far inland nameless wails came from him as desolate sounds from out ravines but this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it in an instant's compass great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler men's whole lives and so such hearts though summary in each one suffering still if the gods decree it in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe wholly made up of instantaneous intensities for even in their pointless centres those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls the harpoon said ahab half way rising and draggingly leaning on one bended arm -- is it safe aye sir for it was not darted this is it said stubb showing it lay it before me -- any missing men one two three four five -- there were five oars sir and here are five men that's good -- help me man i wish to stand so so i see him there there going to leeward still what a leaping spout -- hands off from me the eternal sap runs up in ahab's bones again set the sail out oars the helm it is often the case that when a boat is stove its crew being picked up by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars it was thus now but the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin swimming with a velocity which plainly showed that if now under these circumstances pushed on the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged if not a hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long a period such an unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude the ship itself then as it sometimes happens offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase accordingly the boats now made for her and were soon swayed up to their cranes -- the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her -- and then hoisting everything to her side and stacking her canvas high up and sideways outstretching it with stun-sails like the double-jointed wings of an albatross the pequod bore down in the leeward wake of moby-dick at the well known methodic intervals the whale's glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mast-heads and when he would be reported as just gone down ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck binnacle-watch in hand so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired his voice was heard -- whose is the doubloon now d'ye see him and if the reply was no sir straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch in this way the day wore on ahab now aloft and motionless anon unrestingly pacing the planks as he was thus walking uttering no sound except to hail the men aloft or to bid them hoist a sail still higher or to spread one to a still greater breadth -- thus to and fro pacing beneath his slouched hat at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been dropped upon the quarter-deck and lay there reversed broken bow to shattered stern at last he paused before it and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across so over the old man's face there now stole some such added gloom as this stubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though to evince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place in his captain's mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimed -- the thistle the ass refused it pricked his mouth too keenly sir ha ha what soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck man man did i not know thee brave as fearless fire and as mechanical i could swear thou wert a poltroon groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck aye sir said starbuck drawing near 'tis a solemn sight an omen and an ill one omen omen -- the dictionary if the gods think to speak outright to man they will honourably speak outright not shake their heads and give an old wives' darkling hint -- begone ye two are the opposite poles of one thing starbuck is stubb reversed and stubb is starbuck and ye two are all mankind and ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth nor gods nor men his neighbors cold cold -- i shiver -- how now aloft there d'ye see him sing out for every spout though he spout ten times a second the day was nearly done only the hem of his golden robe was rustling soon it was almost dark but the look-out men still remained unset can't see the spout now sir -- too dark -- cried a voice from the air how heading when last seen as before sir -- straight to leeward good he will travel slower now 'tis night down royals and top-gallant stun-sails mr starbuck we must not run over him before morning he's making a passage now and may heave-to a while helm there keep her full before the wind -- aloft come down -- mr stubb send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head and see it manned till morning -- then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast -- men this gold is mine for i earned it but i shall let it abide here till the white whale is dead and then whosoever of ye first raises him upon the day he shall be killed this gold is that man's and if on that day i shall again raise him then ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye away now -- the deck is thine sir and so saying he placed himself half way within the scuttle and slouching his hat stood there till dawn except when at intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on chapter 134 the chase -- second day at day-break the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh d'ye see him cried ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread see nothing sir turn up all hands and make sail he travels faster than i thought for -- the top-gallant sails -- aye they should have been kept on her all night but no matter -- 'tis but resting for the rush here be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale continued through day into night and through night into day is a thing by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery for such is the wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucket commanders that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried they will under certain given circumstances pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time while out of sight as well as his probable rate of progression during that period and in these cases somewhat as a pilot when about losing sight of a coast whose general trending he well knows and which he desires shortly to return to again but at some further point like as this pilot stands by his compass and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote unseen headland eventually to be visited so does the fisherman at his compass with the whale for after being chased and diligently marked through several hours of daylight then when night obscures the fish the creature's future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter as the pilot's coast is to him so that to this hunter's wondrous skill the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water a wake is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace that with watches in their hands men time his rate as doctors that of a baby's pulse and lightly say of it the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an hour even so almost there are occasions when these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep according to the observed humor of his speed and say to themselves so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude but to render this acuteness at all successful in the end the wind and the sea must be the whaleman's allies for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port inferable from these statements are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales the ship tore on leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball missent becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field by salt and hemp cried stubb but this swift motion of the deck creeps up one's legs and tingles at the heart this ship and i are two brave fellows -- ha ha some one take me up and launch me spine-wise on the sea -- for by live-oaks my spine's a keel ha ha we go the gait that leaves no dust behind there she blows -- she blows -- she blows -- right ahead was now the mast-head cry aye aye cried stubb i knew it -- ye can't escape -- blow on and split your spout o whale the mad fiend himself is after ye blow your trump -- blister your lungs -- ahab will dam off your blood as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew the frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up like old wine worked anew whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of ahab but they were broken up and on all sides routed as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison the hand of fate had snatched all their souls and by the stirring perils of the previous day the rack of the past night's suspense the fixed unfearing blind reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark by all these things their hearts were bowled along the wind that made great bellies of their sails and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race they were one man not thirty for as the one ship that held them all though it was put together of all contrasting things -- oak and maple and pine wood iron and pitch and hemp -- yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull which shot on its way both balanced and directed by the long central keel even so all the individualities of the crew this man's valor that man's fear guilt and guiltiness all varieties were welded into oneness and were all directed to that fatal goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to the rigging lived the mast-heads like the tops of tall palms were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs clinging to a spar with one hand some reached forth the other with impatient wavings others shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight sat far out on the rocking yards all the spars in full bearing of mortals ready and ripe for their fate ah how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them why sing ye not out for him if ye see him cried ahab when after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry no more had been heard sway me up men ye have been deceived not moby dick casts one odd jet that way and then disappears it was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale-spout as the event itself soon proved for hardly had ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck when he struck the key-note to an orchestra that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles the triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard as -- much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile ahead -- moby dick bodily burst into view for not by any calm and indolent spoutings not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did the white whale now reveal his vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more in those moments the torn enraged waves he shakes off seem his mane in some cases this breaching is his act of defiance there she breaches there she breaches was the cry as in his immeasurable bravadoes the white whale tossed himself salmon-like to heaven so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raised for the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale aye breach your last to the sun moby dick cried ahab thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand -- down down all of ye but one man at the fore the boats -- stand by unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds the men like shooting stars slid to the deck by the isolated backstays and halyards while ahab less dartingly but still rapidly was dropped from his perch lower away he cried so soon as he had reached his boat -- a spare one rigged the afternoon previous mr starbuck the ship is thine -- keep away from the boats but keep near them lower all as if to strike a quick terror into them by this time being the first assailant himself moby dick had turned and was now coming for the three crews ahab's boat was central and cheering his men he told them he would take the whale head-and-head -- that is pull straight up to his forehead -- a not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale's sidelong vision but ere that close limit was gained and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his eye the white whale churning himself into furious speed almost in an instant as it were rushing among the boats with open jaws and a lashing tail offered appalling battle on every side and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made but skilfully manoeuvred incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field the boats for a while eluded him though at times but by a plank's breadth while all the time ahab's unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds but at last in his untraceable evolutions the white whale so crossed and recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselves warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little as if to rally for a more tremendous charge seizing that opportunity ahab first paid out more line and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again -- hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls -- when lo -- a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks caught and twisted -- corkscrewed in the mazes of the line loose harpoons and lances with all their bristling barbs and points came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahab's boat only one thing could be done seizing the boat-knife he critically reached within -- through -- and then without -- the rays of steel dragged in the line beyond passed it inboard to the bowsman and then twice sundering the rope near the chocks -- dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea and was all fast again that instant the white whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines by so doing irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and flask towards his flukes dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach and then diving down into the sea disappeared in a boiling maelstrom in which for a space the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch while the two crews were yet circling in the waters reaching out after the revolving line-tubs oars and other floating furniture while aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks and stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up and while the old man's line -- now parting -- admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could -- in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils -- ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards heaven by invisible wires -- as arrow-like shooting perpendicularly from the sea the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom and sent it turning over and over into the air till it fell again -- gunwale downwards -- and ahab and his men struggled out from under it like seals from a sea-side cave the first uprising momentum of the whale -- modifying its direction as he struck the surface -- involuntarily launched him along it to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made and with his back to it he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin his tail swiftly drew back and came sideways smiting the sea but soon as if satisfied that his work for that time was done he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean and trailing after him the intertangled lines continued his leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace as before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight again came bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up the floating mariners tubs oars and whatever else could be caught at and safely landed them on her decks some sprained shoulders wrists and ankles livid contusions wrenched harpoons and lances inextricable intricacies of rope shattered oars and planks all these were there but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one as with fedallah the day before so ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat's broken half which afforded a comparatively easy float nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day's mishap but when he was helped to the deck all eyes were fastened upon him as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of starbuck who had thus far been the foremost to assist him his ivory leg had been snapped off leaving but one short sharp splinter aye aye starbuck 'tis sweet to lean sometimes be the leaner who he will and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he has the ferrule has not stood sir said the carpenter now coming up i put good work into that leg but no bones broken sir i hope said stubb with true concern aye and all splintered to pieces stubb -- d'ye see it -- but even with a broken bone old ahab is untouched and i account no living bone of mine one jot more me than this dead one that's lost nor white whale nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being can any lead touch yonder floor any mast scrape yonder roof -- aloft there which way dead to leeward sir up helm then pile on the sail again ship keepers down the rest of the spare boats and rig them -- mr starbuck away and muster the boat's crews let me first help thee towards the bulwarks sir oh oh oh how this splinter gores me now accursed fate that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate sir my body man not thee give me something for a cane -- there that shivered lance will do muster the men surely i have not seen him yet by heaven it cannot be -- missing -- quick call them all the old man's hinted thought was true upon mustering the company the parsee was not there the parsee cried stubb -- he must have been caught in -- the black vomit wrench thee -- run all of ye above alow cabin forecastle -- find him -- not gone -- not gone but quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the parsee was nowhere to be found aye sir said stubb -- caught among the tangles of your line -- i thought i saw him dragging under my line my line gone -- gone what means that little word -- what death-knell rings in it that old ahab shakes as if he were the belfry the harpoon too -- toss over the litter there -- d'ye see it -- the forged iron men the white whale's -- no no no -- blistered fool this hand did dart it -- 'tis in the fish -- aloft there keep him nailed -- quick -- all hands to the rigging of the boats -- collect the oars -- harpooneers the irons the irons -- hoist the royals higher -- a pull on all the sheets -- helm there steady steady for your life i'll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe yea and dive straight through it but i'll slay him yet great god but for one single instant show thyself cried starbuck never never wilt thou capture him old man -- in jesus' name no more of this that's worse than devil's madness two days chased twice stove to splinters thy very leg once more snatched from under thee thy evil shadow gone -- all good angels mobbing thee with warnings -- what more wouldst thou have -- shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea shall we be towed by him to the infernal world oh oh -- impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more starbuck of late i've felt strangely moved to thee ever since that hour we both saw -- thou know'st what in one another's eyes but in this matter of the whale be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand -- a lipless unfeatured blank ahab is for ever ahab man this whole act's immutably decreed 'twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled fool i am the fates' lieutenant i act under orders look thou underling that thou obeyest mine -- stand round me men ye see an old man cut down to the stump leaning on a shivered lance propped up on a lonely foot 'tis ahab -- his body's part but ahab's soul's a centipede that moves upon a hundred legs i feel strained half stranded as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale and i may look so but ere i break yell hear me crack and till ye hear that know that ahab's hawser tows his purpose yet believe ye men in the things called omens then laugh aloud and cry encore for ere they drown drowning things will twice rise to the surface then rise again to sink for evermore so with moby dick -- two days he's floated -- tomorrow will be the third aye men he'll rise once more -- but only to spout his last d'ye feel brave men brave as fearless fire cried stubb and as mechanical muttered ahab then as the men went forward he muttered on the things called omens and yesterday i talked the same to starbuck there concerning my broken boat oh how valiantly i seek to drive out of others' hearts what's clinched so fast in mine -- the parsee -- the parsee -- gone gone and he was to go before -- but still was to be seen again ere i could perish -- how's that -- there's a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of judges -- like a hawk's beak it pecks my brain i'll i'll solve it though when dusk descended the whale was still in sight to leeward so once more the sail was shortened and everything passed nearly as on the previous night only the sound of hammers and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow meantime of the broken keel of ahab's wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg while still as on the night before slouched ahab stood fixed within his scuttle his hid heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial sat due eastward for the earliest sun chapter 135 the chase -- third day the morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh and once more the solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the daylight look-outs who dotted every mast and almost every spar d'ye see him cried ahab but the whale was not yet in sight in his infallible wake though but follow that wake that's all helm there steady as thou goest and hast been going what a lovely day again were it a new-made world and made for a summer-house to the angels and this morning the first of its throwing open to them a fairer day could not dawn upon that world here's food for thought had ahab time to think but ahab never thinks he only feels feels feels that's tingling enough for mortal man to think's audacity god only has that right and privilege thinking is or ought to be a coolness and a calmness and our poor hearts throb and our poor brains beat too much for that and yet i've sometimes thought my brain was very calm -- frozen calm this old skull cracks so like a glass in which the contents turned to ice and shiver it and still this hair is growing now this moment growing and heat must breed it but no it's like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy clefts of greenland ice or in vesuvius lava how the wild winds blow it they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to a vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells and wards of hospitals and ventilated them and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces out upon it -- it's tainted were i the wind i'd blow no more on such a wicked miserable world i'd crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there and yet 'tis a noble and heroic thing the wind who ever conquered it in every fight it has the last and bitterest blow run tilting at it and you but run through it ha a coward wind that strikes stark naked men but will not stand to receive a single blow even ahab is a braver thing -- a nobler thing than that would now the wind but had a body but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man all these things are bodiless but only bodiless as objects not as agents there's a most special a most cunning oh a most malicious difference and yet i say again and swear it now that there's something all glorious and gracious in the wind these warm trade winds at least that in the clear heavens blow straight on in strong and steadfast vigorous mildness and veer not from their mark however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack and mightiest mississippies of the land swift and swerve about uncertain where to go at last and by the eternal poles these same trades that so directly blow my good ship on these trades or something like them -- something so unchangeable and full as strong blow my keeled soul along to it aloft there what d'ye see nothing sir nothing and noon at hand the doubloon goes a-begging see the sun aye aye it must be so i've oversailed him how got the start aye he's chasing me now not i him -- that's bad i might have known it too fool the lines -- the harpoons he's towing aye aye i have run him by last night about about come down all of ye but the regular look outs man the braces steering as she had done the wind had been somewhat on the pequod's quarter so that now being pointed in the reverse direction the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake against the wind he now steers for the open jaw murmured starbuck to himself as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail god keep us but already my bones feel damp within me and from the inside wet my flesh i misdoubt me that i disobey my god in obeying him stand by to sway me up cried ahab advancing to the hempen basket we should meet him soon aye aye sir and straightway starbuck did ahab's bidding and once more ahab swung on high a whole hour now passed gold-beaten out to ages time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense but at last some three points off the weather bow ahab descried the spout again and instantly from the three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it forehead to forehead i meet thee this third time moby dick on deck there -- brace sharper up crowd her into the wind's eye he's too far off to lower yet mr starbuck the sails shake stand over that helmsman with a top-maul so so he travels fast and i must down but let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea there's time for that an old old sight and yet somehow so young aye and not changed a wink since i first saw it a boy from the sand-hills of nantucket the same -- the same -- the same to noah as to me there's a soft shower to leeward such lovely leewardings they must lead somewhere -- to something else than common land more palmy than the palms leeward the white whale goes that way look to windward then the better if the bitterer quarter but good bye good bye old mast-head what's this -- green aye tiny mosses in these warped cracks no such green weather stains on ahab's head there's the difference now between man's old age and matter's but aye old mast we both grow old together sound in our hulls though are we not my ship aye minus a leg that's all by heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way i can't compare with it and i've known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers what's that he said he should still go before me my pilot and yet to be seen again but where will i have eyes at the bottom of the sea supposing i descend those endless stairs and all night i've been sailing from him wherever he did sink to aye aye like many more thou told'st direful truth as touching thyself o parsee but ahab there thy shot fell short good-bye mast-head -- keep a good eye upon the whale the while i'm gone we'll talk to-morrow nay to-night when the white whale lies down there tied by head and tail he gave the word and still gazing round him was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck in due time the boats were lowered but as standing in his shallop's stern ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent he waved to the mate -- who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck -- and bade him pause starbuck sir for the third time my soul's ship starts upon this voyage starbuck aye sir thou wilt have it so some ships sail from their ports and ever afterwards are missing starbuck truth sir saddest truth some men die at ebb tide some at low water some at the full of the flood -- and i feel now like a billow that's all one crested comb starbuck i am old -- shake hands with me man their hands met their eyes fastened starbuck's tears the glue oh my captain my captain -- noble heart -- go not -- go not -- see it's a brave man that weeps how great the agony of the persuasion then lower away -- cried ahab tossing the mate's arm from him stand by the crew in an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern the sharks the sharks cried a voice from the low cabin-window there o master my master come back but ahab heard nothing for his own voice was high-lifted then and the boat leaped on yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when numbers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars every time they dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in those swarming seas the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east but these were the first sharks that had been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first descried and whether it was that ahab's crew were all such tiger-yellow barbarians and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks -- a matter sometimes well known to affect them -- however it was they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others heart of wrought steel murmured starbuck gazing over the side and following with his eyes the receding boat -- canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight -- lowering thy keel among ravening sharks and followed by them open-mouthed to the chase and this the critical third day -- for when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit be sure the first is the morning the second the noon and the third the evening and the end of that thing -- be that end what it may oh my god what is this that shoots through me and leaves me so deadly calm yet expectant -- fixed at the top of a shudder future things swim before me as in empty outlines and skeletons all the past is somehow grown dim mary girl thou fadest in pale glories behind me boy i seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue strangest problems of life seem clearing but clouds sweep between -- is my journey's end coming my legs feel faint like his who has footed it all day feel thy heart -- beats it yet stir thyself starbuck -- stave it off -- move move speak aloud -- mast-head there see ye my boy's hand on the hill -- crazed -- aloft there -- keep thy keenest eye upon the boats -- mark well the whale -- ho again -- drive off that hawk see he pecks -- he tears the vane -- pointing to the red flag flying at the main-truck -- ha he soars away with it -- where's the old man now see'st thou that sight oh ahab -- shudder shudder the boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mast-heads -- a downward pointed arm ahab knew that the whale had sounded but intending to be near him at the next rising he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow drive drive in your nails oh ye waves to their uttermost heads drive them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coffin and no hearse can be mine -- and hemp only can kill me ha ha suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles then quickly upheaved as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice swiftly rising to the surface a low rumbling sound was heard a subterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggled with trailing ropes and harpoons and lances a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air and then fell swamping back into the deep crushed thirty feet upwards the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale give way cried ahab to the oarsmen and the boats darted forward to the attack but maddened by yesterday's fresh irons that corroded in him moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together as head on he came churning his tail among the boats and once more flailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates' boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows but leaving ahab's almost without a scar while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks and as the whale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up lashed round and round to the fish's back pinioned in the turns upon turns in which during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him the half torn body of the parsee was seen his sable raiment frayed to shreds his distended eyes turned full upon old ahab the harpoon dropped from his hand befooled befooled -- drawing in a long lean breath -- aye parsee i see thee again -- aye and thou goest before and this this then is the hearse that thou didst promise but i hold thee to the last letter of thy word where is the second hearse away mates to the ship those boats are useless now repair them if ye can in time and return to me if not ahab is enough to die -- down men the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat i stand in that thing i harpoon ye are not other men but my arms and my legs and so obey me -- where's the whale gone down again but he looked too nigh the boat for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage moby dick was now again steadily swimming forward and had almost passed the ship -- which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him though for the present her headway had been stopped he seemed swimming with his utmost velocity and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea oh ahab cried starbuck not too late is it even now the third day to desist see moby dick seeks thee not it is thou thou that madly seekest him setting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward by both oars and canvas and at last when ahab was sliding by the vessel so near as plainly to distinguish starbuck's face as he leaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the vessel about and follow him not too swiftly at a judicious interval glancing upwards he saw tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side and were busily at work in repairing them one after the other through the port-holes as he sped he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances as he saw all this as he heard the hammers in the broken boats far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart but he rallied and now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head he shouted to tashtego who had just gained that perch to descend again for another flag and a hammer and nails and so nail it to the mast whether fagged by the three days' running chase and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever was true the white whale's way now began to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more though indeed the whale's last start had not been so long a one as before and still as ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat and so continually bit at the plying oars that the blades became jagged and crunched and left small splinters in the sea at almost every dip heed them not those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars pull on 'tis the better rest the shark's jaw than the yielding water but at every bite sir the thin blades grow smaller and smaller they will last long enough pull on -- but who can tell -- he muttered -- whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on ahab -- but pull on aye all alive now -- we near him the helm take the helm let me pass -- and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat at length as the craft was cast to one side and ran ranging along with the white whale's flank he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance -- as the whale sometimes will -- and ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist which thrown off from the whale's spout curled round his great monadnock hump he was even thus close to him when with body arched back and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the poise he darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale as both steel and curse sank to the socket as if sucked into a morass moby dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow and without staving a hole in it so suddenly canted the boat over that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea as it was three of the oarsmen -- who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for its effects -- these were flung out but so fell that in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again and rising to its level on a combing wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again the third man helplessly dropping astern but still afloat and swimming almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness the white whale darted through the weltering sea but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air what breaks in me some sinew cracks -- 'tis whole again oars oars burst in upon him hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay but in that evolution catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions bethinking it -- it may be -- a larger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing prow smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam ahab staggered his hand smote his forehead i grow blind hands stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way is't night the whale the ship cried the cringing oarsmen oars oars slope downwards to thy depths o sea that ere it be for ever too late ahab may slide this last last time upon his mark i see the ship the ship dash on my men will ye not save my ship but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge-hammering seas the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves its half-wading splashing crew trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water meantime for that one beholding instant tashtego's mast-head hammer remained suspended in his hand and the red flag half-wrapping him as with a plaid then streamed itself straight out from him as his own forward-flowing heart while starbuck and stubb standing upon the bowsprit beneath caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon as he the whale the whale up helm up helm oh all ye sweet powers of air now hug me close let not starbuck die if die he must in a woman's fainting fit up helm i say -- ye fools the jaw the jaw is this the end of all my bursting prayers all my life-long fidelities oh ahab ahab lo thy work steady helmsman steady nay nay up helm again he turns to meet us oh his unappeasable brow drives on towards one whose duty tells him he cannot depart my god stand by me now stand not by me but stand under me whoever you are that will now help stubb for stubb too sticks here i grin at thee thou grinning whale who ever helped stubb or kept stubb awake but stubb's own unwinking eye and now poor stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft would it were stuffed with brushwood i grin at thee thou grinning whale look ye sun moon and stars i call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost for all that i would yet ring glasses with ye would ye but hand the cup oh oh oh oh thou grinning whale but there'll be plenty of gulping soon why fly ye not o ahab for me off shoes and jacket to it let stubb die in his drawers a most mouldy and over salted death though -- cherries cherries cherries oh flask for one red cherry ere we die cherries i only wish that we were where they grow oh stubb i hope my poor mother's drawn my part-pay ere this if not few coppers will now come to her for the voyage is up from the ship's bows nearly all the seamen now hung inactive hammers bits of plank lances and harpoons mechanically retained in their hands just as they had darted from their various employments all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed retribution swift vengeance eternal malice were in his whole aspect and spite of all that mortal man could do the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship's starboard bow till men and timbers reeled some fell flat upon their faces like dislodged trucks the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks through the breach they heard the waters pour as mountain torrents down a flume the ship the hearse -- the second hearse cried ahab from the boat its wood could only be american diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along its keel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again far off the other bow but within a few yards of ahab's boat where for a time he lay quiescent i turn my body from the sun what ho tashtego let me hear thy hammer oh ye three unsurrendered spires of mine thou uncracked keel and only god-bullied hull thou firm deck and haughty helm and pole-pointed prow -- death-glorious ship must ye then perish and without me am i cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains oh lonely death on lonely life oh now i feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief ho ho from all your furthest bounds pour ye now in ye bold billows of my whole foregone life and top this one piled comber of my death towards thee i roll thou all-destroying but unconquering whale to the last i grapple with thee from hell's heart i stab at thee for hate's sake i spit my last breath at thee sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool and since neither can be mine let me then tow to pieces while still chasing thee though tied to thee thou damned whale thus i give up the spear the harpoon was darted the stricken whale flew forward with igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves -- ran foul ahab stooped to clear it he did clear it but the flying turn caught him round the neck and voicelessly as turkish mutes bowstring their victim he was shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he was gone next instant the heavy eye-splice in the rope's final end flew out of the stark-empty tub knocked down an oarsman and smiting the sea disappeared in its depths for an instant the tranced boat's crew stood still then turned the ship great god where is the ship soon they through dim bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom as in the gaseous fata morgana only the uppermost masts out of water while fixed by infatuation or fidelity or fate to their once lofty perches the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea and now concentric circles seized the lone boat itself and all its crew and each floating oar and every lance-pole and spinning animate and inanimate all round and round in one vortex carried the smallest chip of the pequod out of sight but as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the indian at the mainmast leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible together with long streaming yards of the flag which calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over the destroying billows they almost touched -- at that instant a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar a sky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home among the stars pecking at the flag and incommoding tashtego there this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill the submerged savage beneath in his death-gasp kept his hammer frozen there and so the bird of heaven with archangelic shrieks and his imperial beak thrust upwards and his whole captive form folded in the flag of ahab went down with his ship which like satan would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her and helmeted herself with it now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides then all collapsed and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago epilogue and i only am escaped alone to tell thee job the drama's done why then here does any one step forth -- because one did survive the wreck it so chanced that after the parsee's disappearance i was he whom the fates ordained to take the place of ahab's bowsman when that bowsman assumed the vacant post the same who when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat was dropped astern so floating on the margin of the ensuing scene and in full sight of it when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me i was then but slowly drawn towards the closing vortex when i reached it it had subsided to a creamy pool round and round then and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle like another ixion i did revolve till gaining that vital centre the black bubble upward burst and now liberated by reason of its cunning spring and owing to its great buoyancy rising with great force the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea fell over and floated by my side buoyed up by that coffin for almost one whole day and night i floated on a soft and dirgelike main the unharming sharks they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks on the second day a sail drew near nearer and picked me up at last it was the devious-cruising rachel that in her retracing search after her missing children only found another orphan,0,0,0.005992729088970865

intends to soar above th' aonian mount while it pursues things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme and chiefly thou o spirit that dost prefer before all temples th' upright heart and pure instruct me for thou know'st thou from the first wast present and with mighty wings outspread dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast abyss and mad'st it pregnant what in me is dark illumine what is low raise and support that to the height of this great argument i may assert eternal providence and justify the ways of god to men say first -- for heaven hides nothing from thy view nor the deep tract of hell -- say first what cause moved our grand parents in that happy state favoured of heaven so highly to fall off from their creator and transgress his will for one restraint lords of the world besides who first seduced them to that foul revolt th' infernal serpent he it was whose guile stirred up with envy and revenge deceived the mother of mankind what time his pride had cast him out from heaven with all his host of rebel angels by whose aid aspiring to set himself in glory above his peers he trusted to have equalled the most high if he opposed and with ambitious aim against the throne and monarchy of god raised impious war in heaven and battle proud with vain attempt him the almighty power hurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky with hideous ruin and combustion down to bottomless perdition there to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire who durst defy th' omnipotent to arms nine times the space that measures day and night to mortal men he with his horrid crew lay vanquished rolling in the fiery gulf confounded though immortal but his doom reserved him to more wrath for now the thought both of lost happiness and lasting pain torments him round he throws his baleful eyes that witnessed huge affliction and dismay mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate at once as far as angels ken he views the dismal situation waste and wild a dungeon horrible on all sides round as one great furnace flamed yet from those flames no light but rather darkness visible served only to discover sights of woe regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace and rest can never dwell hope never comes that comes to all but torture without end still urges and a fiery deluge fed with ever-burning sulphur unconsumed such place eternal justice has prepared for those rebellious here their prison ordained in utter darkness and their portion set as far removed from god and light of heaven as from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole oh how unlike the place from whence they fell there the companions of his fall o'erwhelmed with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire he soon discerns and weltering by his side one next himself in power and next in crime long after known in palestine and named beelzebub to whom th' arch-enemy and thence in heaven called satan with bold words breaking the horrid silence thus began -- if thou beest he -- but o how fallen how changed from him who in the happy realms of light clothed with transcendent brightness didst outshine myriads though bright -- if he whom mutual league united thoughts and counsels equal hope and hazard in the glorious enterprise joined with me once now misery hath joined in equal ruin into what pit thou seest from what height fallen so much the stronger proved he with his thunder and till then who knew the force of those dire arms yet not for those nor what the potent victor in his rage can else inflict do i repent or change though changed in outward lustre that fixed mind and high disdain from sense of injured merit that with the mightiest raised me to contend and to the fierce contentions brought along innumerable force of spirits armed that durst dislike his reign and me preferring his utmost power with adverse power opposed in dubious battle on the plains of heaven and shook his throne what though the field be lost all is not lost -- the unconquerable will and study of revenge immortal hate and courage never to submit or yield and what is else not to be overcome that glory never shall his wrath or might extort from me to bow and sue for grace with suppliant knee and deify his power who from the terror of this arm so late doubted his empire -- that were low indeed that were an ignominy and shame beneath this downfall since by fate the strength of gods and this empyreal sybstance cannot fail since through experience of this great event in arms not worse in foresight much advanced we may with more successful hope resolve to wage by force or guile eternal war irreconcilable to our grand foe who now triumphs and in th' excess of joy sole reigning holds the tyranny of heaven so spake th' apostate angel though in pain vaunting aloud but racked with deep despair and him thus answered soon his bold compeer -- o prince o chief of many throned powers that led th' embattled seraphim to war under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds fearless endangered heaven's perpetual king and put to proof his high supremacy whether upheld by strength or chance or fate too well i see and rue the dire event that with sad overthrow and foul defeat hath lost us heaven and all this mighty host in horrible destruction laid thus low as far as gods and heavenly essences can perish for the mind and spirit remains invincible and vigour soon returns though all our glory extinct and happy state here swallowed up in endless misery but what if he our conqueror whom i now of force believe almighty since no less than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours have left us this our spirit and strength entire strongly to suffer and support our pains that we may so suffice his vengeful ire or do him mightier service as his thralls by right of war whate'er his business be here in the heart of hell to work in fire or do his errands in the gloomy deep what can it the avail though yet we feel strength undiminished or eternal being to undergo eternal punishment whereto with speedy words th' arch-fiend replied -- fallen cherub to be weak is miserable doing or suffering but of this be sure -- to do aught good never will be our task but ever to do ill our sole delight as being the contrary to his high will whom we resist if then his providence out of our evil seek to bring forth good our labour must be to pervert that end and out of good still to find means of evil which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps shall grieve him if i fail not and disturb his inmost counsels from their destined aim but see the angry victor hath recalled his ministers of vengeance and pursuit back to the gates of heaven the sulphurous hail shot after us in storm o'erblown hath laid the fiery surge that from the precipice of heaven received us falling and the thunder winged with red lightning and impetuous rage perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now to bellow through the vast and boundless deep let us not slip th' occasion whether scorn or satiate fury yield it from our foe seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wild the seat of desolation void of light save what the glimmering of these livid flames casts pale and dreadful thither let us tend from off the tossing of these fiery waves there rest if any rest can harbour there and re-assembling our afflicted powers consult how we may henceforth most offend our enemy our own loss how repair how overcome this dire calamity what reinforcement we may gain from hope if not what resolution from despair thus satan talking to his nearest mate with head uplift above the wave and eyes that sparkling blazed his other parts besides prone on the flood extended long and large lay floating many a rood in bulk as huge as whom the fables name of monstrous size titanian or earth-born that warred on jove briareos or typhon whom the den by ancient tarsus held or that sea-beast leviathan which god of all his works created hugest that swim th' ocean-stream him haply slumbering on the norway foam the pilot of some small night-foundered skiff deeming some island oft as seamen tell with fixed anchor in his scaly rind moors by his side under the lee while night invests the sea and wished morn delays so stretched out huge in length the arch-fiend lay chained on the burning lake nor ever thence had risen or heaved his head but that the will and high permission of all-ruling heaven left him at large to his own dark designs that with reiterated crimes he might heap on himself damnation while he sought evil to others and enraged might see how all his malice served but to bring forth infinite goodness grace and mercy shewn on man by him seduced but on himself treble confusion wrath and vengeance poured forthwith upright he rears from off the pool his mighty stature on each hand the flames driven backward slope their pointing spires and rolled in billows leave i' th' midst a horrid vale then with expanded wings he steers his flight aloft incumbent on the dusky air that felt unusual weight till on dry land he lights -- if it were land that ever burned with solid as the lake with liquid fire and such appeared in hue as when the force of subterranean wind transprots a hill torn from pelorus or the shattered side of thundering etna whose combustible and fuelled entrails thence conceiving fire sublimed with mineral fury aid the winds and leave a singed bottom all involved with stench and smoke such resting found the sole of unblest feet him followed his next mate both glorying to have scaped the stygian flood as gods and by their own recovered strength not by the sufferance of supernal power is this the region this the soil the clime said then the lost archangel this the seat that we must change for heaven -- this mournful gloom for that celestial light be it so since he who now is sovereign can dispose and bid what shall be right farthest from him is best whom reason hath equalled force hath made supreme above his equals farewell happy fields where joy for ever dwells hail horrors hail infernal world and thou profoundest hell receive thy new possessor -- one who brings a mind not to be changed by place or time the mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven what matter where if i be still the same and what i should be all but less than he whom thunder hath made greater here at least we shall be free th' almighty hath not built here for his envy will not drive us hence here we may reigh secure and in my choice to reign is worth ambition though in hell better to reign in hell than serve in heaven but wherefore let we then our faithful friends th' associates and co-partners of our loss lie thus astonished on th' oblivious pool and call them not to share with us their part in this unhappy mansion or once more with rallied arms to try what may be yet regained in heaven or what more lost in hell so satan spake and him beelzebub thus answered -- leader of those armies bright which but th' omnipotent none could have foiled if once they hear that voice their liveliest pledge of hope in fears and dangers -- heard so oft in worst extremes and on the perilous edge of battle when it raged in all assaults their surest signal -- they will soon resume new courage and revive though now they lie grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire as we erewhile astounded and amazed no wonder fallen such a pernicious height he scare had ceased when the superior fiend was moving toward the shore his ponderous shield ethereal temper massy large and round behind him cast the broad circumference hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb through optic glass the tuscan artist views at evening from the top of fesole or in valdarno to descry new lands rivers or mountains in her spotty globe his spear -- to equal which the tallest pine hewn on norwegian hills to be the mast of some great ammiral were but a wand -- he walked with to support uneasy steps over the burning marl not like those steps on heaven's azure and the torrid clime smote on him sore besides vaulted with fire nathless he so endured till on the beach of that inflamed sea he stood and called his legions -- angel forms who lay entranced thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks in vallombrosa where th' etrurian shades high over-arched embower or scattered sedge afloat when with fierce winds orion armed hath vexed the red-sea coast whose waves o'erthrew busiris and his memphian chivalry while with perfidious hatred they pursued the sojourners of goshen who beheld from the safe shore their floating carcases and broken chariot-wheels so thick bestrown abject and lost lay these covering the flood under amazement of their hideous change he called so loud that all the hollow deep of hell resounded -- princes potentates warriors the flower of heaven -- once yours now lost if such astonishment as this can seize eternal spirits or have ye chosen this place after the toil of battle to repose your wearied virtue for the ease you find to slumber here as in the vales of heaven or in this abject posture have ye sworn to adore the conqueror who now beholds cherub and seraph rolling in the flood with scattered arms and ensigns till anon his swift pursuers from heaven-gates discern th' advantage and descending tread us down thus drooping or with linked thunderbolts transfix us to the bottom of this gulf awake arise or be for ever fallen they heard and were abashed and up they sprung upon the wing as when men wont to watch on duty sleeping found by whom they dread rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake nor did they not perceive the evil plight in which they were or the fierce pains not feel yet to their general's voice they soon obeyed innumerable as when the potent rod of amram's son in egypt's evil day waved round the coast up-called a pitchy cloud of locusts warping on the eastern wind that o'er the realm of impious pharaoh hung like night and darkened all the land of nile so numberless were those bad angels seen hovering on wing under the cope of hell 'twixt upper nether and surrounding fires till as a signal given th' uplifted spear of their great sultan waving to direct their course in even balance down they light on the firm brimstone and fill all the plain a multitude like which the populous north poured never from her frozen loins to pass rhene or the danaw when her barbarous sons came like a deluge on the south and spread beneath gibraltar to the libyan sands forthwith form every squadron and each band the heads and leaders thither haste where stood their great commander -- godlike shapes and forms excelling human princely dignities and powers that erst in heaven sat on thrones though on their names in heavenly records now be no memorial blotted out and rased by their rebellion from the books of life nor had they yet among the sons of eve got them new names till wandering o'er the earth through god's high sufferance for the trial of man by falsities and lies the greatest part of mankind they corrupted to forsake god their creator and th' invisible glory of him that made them to transform oft to the image of a brute adorned with gay religions full of pomp and gold and devils to adore for deities then were they known to men by various names and various idols through the heathen world say muse their names then known who first who last roused from the slumber on that fiery couch at their great emperor's call as next in worth came singly where he stood on the bare strand while the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof the chief were those who from the pit of hell roaming to seek their prey on earth durst fix their seats long after next the seat of god their altars by his altar gods adored among the nations round and durst abide jehovah thundering out of sion throned between the cherubim yea often placed within his sanctuary itself their shrines abominations and with cursed things his holy rites and solemn feasts profaned and with their darkness durst affront his light first moloch horrid king besmeared with blood of human sacrifice and parents' tears though for the noise of drums and timbrels loud their children's cries unheard that passed through fire to his grim idol him the ammonite worshiped in rabba and her watery plain in argob and in basan to the stream of utmost arnon nor content with such audacious neighbourhood the wisest heart of solomon he led by fraoud to build his temple right against the temple of god on that opprobrious hill and made his grove the pleasant valley of hinnom tophet thence and black gehenna called the type of hell next chemos th' obscene dread of moab's sons from aroar to nebo and the wild of southmost abarim in hesebon and horonaim seon's real beyond the flowery dale of sibma clad with vines and eleale to th' asphaltic pool peor his other name when he enticed israel in sittim on their march from nile to do him wanton rites which cost them woe yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged even to that hill of scandal by the grove of moloch homicide lust hard by hate till good josiah drove them thence to hell with these came they who from the bordering flood of old euphrates to the brook that parts egypt from syrian ground had general names of baalim and ashtaroth -- those male these feminine for spirits when they please can either sex assume or both so soft and uncompounded is their essence pure not tried or manacled with joint or limb nor founded on the brittle strength of bones like cumbrous flesh but in what shape they choose dilated or condensed bright or obscure can execute their airy purposes and works of love or enmity fulfil for those the race of israel oft forsook their living strength and unfrequented left his righteous altar bowing lowly down to bestial gods for which their heads as low bowed down in battle sunk before the spear of despicable foes with these in troop came astoreth whom the phoenicians called astarte queen of heaven with crescent horns to whose bright image nigntly by the moon sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs in sion also not unsung where stood her temple on th' offensive mountain built by that uxorious king whose heart though large beguiled by fair idolatresses fell to idols foul thammuz came next behind whose annual wound in lebanon allured the syrian damsels to lament his fate in amorous ditties all a summer's day while smooth adonis from his native rock ran purple to the sea supposed with blood of thammuz yearly wounded the love-tale infected sion's daughters with like heat whose wanton passions in the sacred proch ezekiel saw when by the vision led his eye surveyed the dark idolatries of alienated judah next came one who mourned in earnest when the captive ark maimed his brute image head and hands lopt off in his own temple on the grunsel-edge where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers dagon his name sea-monster upward man and downward fish yet had his temple high reared in azotus dreaded through the coast of palestine in gath and ascalon and accaron and gaza's frontier bounds him followed rimmon whose delightful seat was fair damascus on the fertile banks of abbana and pharphar lucid streams he also against the house of god was bold a leper once he lost and gained a king -- ahaz his sottish conqueror whom he drew god's altar to disparage and displace for one of syrian mode whereon to burn his odious offerings and adore the gods whom he had vanquished after these appeared a crew who under names of old renown -- osiris isis orus and their train -- with monstrous shapes and sorceries abused fanatic egypt and her priests to seek their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms rather than human nor did israel scape th' infection when their borrowed gold composed the calf in oreb and the rebel king doubled that sin in bethel and in dan likening his maker to the grazed ox -- jehovah who in one night when he passed from egypt marching equalled with one stroke both her first-born and all her bleating gods belial came last than whom a spirit more lewd fell not from heaven or more gross to love vice for itself to him no temple stood or altar smoked yet who more oft than he in temples and at altars when the priest turns atheist as did eli's sons who filled with lust and violence the house of god in courts and palaces he also reigns and in luxurious cities where the noise of riot ascends above their loftiest towers and injury and outrage and when night darkens the streets then wander forth the sons of belial flown with insolence and wine witness the streets of sodom and that night in gibeah when the hospitable door exposed a matron to avoid worse rape these were the prime in order and in might the rest were long to tell though far renowned th' ionian gods -- of javan's issue held gods yet confessed later than heaven and earth their boasted parents -- titan heaven's first-born with his enormous brood and birthright seized by younger saturn he from mightier jove his own and rhea's son like measure found so jove usurping reigned these first in crete and ida known thence on the snowy top of cold olympus ruled the middle air their highest heaven or on the delphian cliff or in dodona and through all the bounds of doric land or who with saturn old fled over adria to th' hesperian fields and o'er the celtic roamed the utmost isles all these and more came flocking but with looks downcast and damp yet such wherein appeared obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their chief not in despair to have found themselves not lost in loss itself which on his countenance cast like doubtful hue but he his wonted pride soon recollecting with high words that bore semblance of worth not substance gently raised their fainting courage and dispelled their fears then straight commands that at the warlike sound of trumpets loud and clarions be upreared his mighty standard that proud honour claimed azazel as his right a cherub tall who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled th' imperial ensign which full high advanced shone like a meteor streaming to the wind with gems and golden lustre rich emblazed seraphic arms and trophies all the while sonorous metal blowing martial sounds at which the universal host up-sent a shout that tore hell's concave and beyond frighted the reign of chaos and old night all in a moment through the gloom were seen ten thousand banners rise into the air with orient colours waving with them rose a forest huge of spears and thronging helms appeared and serried shields in thick array of depth immeasurable anon they move in perfect phalanx to the dorian mood of flutes and soft recorders -- such as raised to height of noblest temper heroes old arming to battle and instead of rage deliberate valour breathed firm and unmoved with dread of death to flight or foul retreat nor wanting power to mitigate and swage with solemn touches troubled thoughts and chase anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain from mortal or immortal minds thus they breathing united force with fixed thought moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed their painful steps o'er the burnt soil and now advanced in view they stand -- a horrid front of dreadful length and dazzling arms in guise of warriors old with ordered spear and shield awaiting what command their mighty chief had to impose he through the armed files darts his experienced eye and soon traverse the whole battalion views -- their order due their visages and stature as of gods their number last he sums and now his heart distends with pride and hardening in his strength glories for never since created man met such embodied force as named with these could merit more than that small infantry warred on by cranes -- though all the giant brood of phlegra with th' heroic race were joined that fought at thebes and ilium on each side mixed with auxiliar gods and what resounds in fable or romance of uther's son begirt with british and armoric knights and all who since baptized or infidel jousted in aspramont or montalban damasco or marocco or trebisond or whom biserta sent from afric shore when charlemain with all his peerage fell by fontarabbia thus far these beyond compare of mortal prowess yet observed their dread commander he above the rest in shape and gesture proudly eminent stood like a tower his form had yet not lost all her original brightness nor appeared less than archangel ruined and th' excess of glory obscured as when the sun new-risen looks through the horizontal misty air shorn of his beams or from behind the moon in dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds on half the nations and with fear of change perplexes monarchs darkened so yet shone above them all th' archangel but his face deep scars of thunder had intrenched and care sat on his faded cheek but under brows of dauntless courage and considerate pride waiting revenge cruel his eye but cast signs of remorse and passion to behold the fellows of his crime the followers rather far other once beheld in bliss condemned for ever now to have their lot in pain -- millions of spirits for his fault amerced of heaven and from eteranl splendours flung for his revolt -- yet faithful how they stood their glory withered as when heaven's fire hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines with singed top their stately growth though bare stands on the blasted heath he now prepared to speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend from wing to wing and half enclose him round with all his peers attention held them mute thrice he assayed and thrice in spite of scorn tears such as angels weep burst forth at last words interwove with sighs found out their way -- o myriads of immortal spirits o powers matchless but with th' almighth -- and that strife was not inglorious though th' event was dire as this place testifies and this dire change hateful to utter but what power of mind forseeing or presaging from the depth of knowledge past or present could have feared how such united force of gods how such as stood like these could ever know repulse for who can yet believe though after loss that all these puissant legions whose exile hath emptied heaven shall fail to re-ascend self-raised and repossess their native seat for me be witness all the host of heaven if counsels different or danger shunned by me have lost our hopes but he who reigns monarch in heaven till then as one secure sat on his throne upheld by old repute consent or custom and his regal state put forth at full but still his strength concealed -- which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall henceforth his might we know and know our own so as not either to provoke or dread new war provoked our better part remains to work in close design by fraud or guile what force effected not that he no less at length from us may find who overcomes by force hath overcome but half his foe space may produce new worlds whereof so rife there went a fame in heaven that he ere long intended to create and therein plant a generation whom his choice regard should favour equal to the sons of heaven thither if but to pry shall be perhaps our first eruption -- thither or elsewhere for this infernal pit shall never hold celestial spirits in bondage nor th' abyss long under darkness cover but these thoughts full counsel must mature peace is despaired for who can think submission war then war open or understood must be resolved he spake and to confirm his words outflew millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs of mighty cherubim the sudden blaze far round illumined hell highly they raged against the highest and fierce with grasped arms clashed on their sounding shields the din of war hurling defiance toward the vault of heaven there stood a hill not far whose grisly top belched fire and rolling smoke the rest entire shone with a glossy scurf -- undoubted sign that in his womb was hid metallic ore the work of sulphur thither winged with speed a numerous brigade hastened as when bands of pioneers with spade and pickaxe armed forerun the royal camp to trench a field or cast a rampart mammon led them on -- mammon the least erected spirit that fell from heaven for even in heaven his looks and thoughts were always downward bent admiring more the riches of heaven's pavement trodden gold than aught divine or holy else enjoyed in vision beatific by him first men also and by his suggestion taught ransacked the centre and with impious hands rifled the bowels of their mother earth for treasures better hid soon had his crew opened into the hill a spacious wound and digged out ribs of gold let none admire that riches grow in hell that soil may best deserve the precious bane and here let those who boast in mortal things and wondering tell of babel and the works of memphian kings learn how their greatest monuments of fame and strength and art are easily outdone by spirits reprobate and in an hour what in an age they with incessant toil and hands innumerable scarce perform nigh on the plain in many cells prepared that underneath had veins of liquid fire sluiced from the lake a second multitude with wondrous art founded the massy ore severing each kind and scummed the bullion-dross a third as soon had formed within the ground a various mould and from the boiling cells by strange conveyance filled each hollow nook as in an organ from one blast of wind to many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes anon out of the earth a fabric huge rose like an exhalation with the sound of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet -- built like a temple where pilasters round were set and doric pillars overlaid with golden architrave nor did there want cornice or frieze with bossy sculptures graven the roof was fretted gold not babylon nor great alcairo such magnificence equalled in all their glories to enshrine belus or serapis their gods or seat their kings when egypt with assyria strove in wealth and luxury th' ascending pile stood fixed her stately height and straight the doors opening their brazen folds discover wide within her ample spaces o'er the smooth and level pavement from the arched roof pendent by subtle magic many a row of starry lamps and blazing cressets fed with naptha and asphaltus yielded light as from a sky the hasty multitude admiring entered and the work some praise and some the architect his hand was known in heaven by many a towered structure high where sceptred angels held their residence and sat as princes whom the supreme king exalted to such power and gave to rule each in his hierarchy the orders bright nor was his name unheard or unadored in ancient greece and in ausonian land men called him mulciber and how he fell from heaven they fabled thrown by angry jove sheer o'er the crystal battlements from morn to noon he fell from noon to dewy eve a summer's day and with the setting sun dropt from the zenith like a falling star on lemnos th' aegaean isle thus they relate erring for he with this rebellious rout fell long before nor aught aviled him now to have built in heaven high towers nor did he scape by all his engines but was headlong sent with his industrious crew to build in hell meanwhile the winged heralds by command of sovereign power with awful ceremony and trumpet's sound throughout the host proclaim a solemn council forthwith to be held at pandemonium the high capital of satan and his peers their summons called from every band and squared regiment by place or choice the worthiest they anon with hundreds and with thousands trooping came attended all access was thronged the gates and porches wide but chief the spacious hall though like a covered field where champions bold wont ride in armed and at the soldan's chair defied the best of paynim chivalry to mortal combat or career with lance thick swarmed both on the ground and in the air brushed with the hiss of rustling wings as bees in spring-time when the sun with taurus rides pour forth their populous youth about the hive in clusters they among fresh dews and flowers fly to and fro or on the smoothed plank the suburb of their straw-built citadel new rubbed with balm expatiate and confer their state-affairs so thick the airy crowd swarmed and were straitened till the signal given behold a wonder they but now who seemed in bigness to surpass earth's giant sons now less than smallest dwarfs in narrow room throng numberless -- like that pygmean race beyond the indian mount or faery elves whose midnight revels by a forest-side or fountain some belated peasant sees or dreams he sees while overhead the moon sits arbitress and nearer to the earth wheels her pale course they on their mirth and dance intent with jocund music charm his ear at once with joy and fear his heart rebounds thus incorporeal spirits to smallest forms reduced their shapes immense and were at large though without number still amidst the hall of that infernal court but far within and in their own dimensions like themselves the great seraphic lords and cherubim in close recess and secret conclave sat a thousand demi-gods on golden seats frequent and full after short silence then and summons read the great consult began book ii high on a throne of royal state which far outshone the wealth or ormus and of ind or where the gorgeous east with richest hand showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold satan exalted sat by merit raised to that bad eminence and from despair thus high uplifted beyond hope aspires beyond thus high insatiate to pursue vain war with heaven and by success untaught his proud imaginations thus displayed -- powers and dominions deities of heaven -- for since no deep within her gulf can hold immortal vigour though oppressed and fallen i give not heaven for lost from this descent celestial virtues rising will appear more glorious and more dread than from no fall and trust themselves to fear no second fate -- me though just right and the fixed laws of heaven did first create your leader -- next free choice with what besides in council or in fight hath been achieved of merit -- yet this loss thus far at least recovered hath much more established in a safe unenvied throne yielded with full consent the happier state in heaven which follows dignity might draw envy from each inferior but who here will envy whom the highest place exposes foremost to stand against the thunderer's aim your bulwark and condemns to greatest share of endless pain where there is then no good for which to strive no strife can grow up there from faction for none sure will claim in hell precedence none whose portion is so small of present pain that with ambitious mind will covet more with this advantage then to union and firm faith and firm accord more than can be in heaven we now return to claim our just inheritance of old surer to prosper than prosperity could have assured us and by what best way whether of open war or covert guile we now debate who can advise may speak he ceased and next him moloch sceptred king stood up -- the strongest and the fiercest spirit that fought in heaven now fiercer by despair his trust was with th' eternal to be deemed equal in strength and rather than be less cared not to be at all with that care lost went all his fear of god or hell or worse he recked not and these words thereafter spake -- my sentence is for open war of wiles more unexpert i boast not them let those contrive who need or when they need not now for while they sit contriving shall the rest -- millions that stand in arms and longing wait the signal to ascend -- sit lingering here heaven's fugitives and for their dwelling-place accept this dark opprobrious den of shame the prison of his ryranny who reigns by our delay no let us rather choose armed with hell-flames and fury all at once o'er heaven's high towers to force resistless way turning our tortures into horrid arms against the torturer when to meet the noise of his almighty engine he shall hear infernal thunder and for lightning see black fire and horror shot with equal rage among his angels and his throne itself mixed with tartarean sulphur and strange fire his own invented torments but perhaps the way seems difficult and steep to scale with upright wing against a higher foe let such bethink them if the sleepy drench of that forgetful lake benumb not still that in our porper motion we ascend up to our native seat descent and fall to us is adverse who but felt of late when the fierce foe hung on our broken rear insulting and pursued us through the deep with what compulsion and laborious flight we sunk thus low th' ascent is easy then th' event is feared should we again provoke our stronger some worse way his wrath may find to our destruction if there be in hell fear to be worse destroyed what can be worse than to dwell here driven out from bliss condemned in this abhorred deep to utter woe where pain of unextinguishable fire must exercise us without hope of end the vassals of his anger when the scourge inexorably and the torturing hour calls us to penance more destroyed than thus we should be quite abolished and expire what fear we then what doubt we to incense his utmost ire which to the height enraged will either quite consume us and reduce to nothing this essential -- happier far than miserable to have eternal being -- or if our substance be indeed divine and cannot cease to be we are at worst on this side nothing and by proof we feel our power sufficient to disturb his heaven and with perpetual inroads to alarm though inaccessible his fatal throne which if not victory is yet revenge he ended frowning and his look denounced desperate revenge and battle dangerous to less than gods on th' other side up rose belial in act more graceful and humane a fairer person lost not heaven he seemed for dignity composed and high exploit but all was false and hollow though his tongue dropped manna and could make the worse appear the better reason to perplex and dash maturest counsels for his thoughts were low -- to vice industrious but to nobler deeds timorous and slothful yet he pleased the ear and with persuasive accent thus began -- i should be much for open war o peers as not behind in hate if what was urged main reason to persuade immediate war did not dissuade me most and seem to cast ominous conjecture on the whole success when he who most excels in fact of arms in what he counsels and in what excels mistrustful grounds his courage on despair and utter dissolution as the scope of all his aim after some dire revenge first what revenge the towers of heaven are filled with armed watch that render all access impregnable oft on the bodering deep encamp their legions or with obscure wing scout far and wide into the realm of night scorning surprise or could we break our way by force and at our heels all hell should rise with blackest insurrection to confound heaven's purest light yet our great enemy all incorruptible would on his throne sit unpolluted and th' ethereal mould incapable of stain would soon expel her mischief and purge off the baser fire victorious thus repulsed our final hope is flat despair we must exasperate th' almighty victor to spend all his rage and that must end us that must be our cure -- to be no more sad cure for who would lose though full of pain this intellectual being those thoughts that wander through eternity to perish rather swallowed up and lost in the wide womb of uncreated night devoid of sense and motion and who knows let this be good whether our angry foe can give it or will ever how he can is doubtful that he never will is sure will he so wise let loose at once his ire belike through impotence or unaware to give his enemies their wish and end them in his anger whom his anger saves to punish endless 'wherefore cease we then ' say they who counsel war 'we are decreed reserved and destined to eternal woe whatever doing what can we suffer more what can we suffer worse ' is this then worst -- thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms what when we fled amain pursued and struck with heaven's afflicting thunder and besought the deep to shelter us this hell then seemed a refuge from those wounds or when we lay chained on the burning lake that sure was worse what if the breath that kindled those grim fires awaked should blow them into sevenfold rage and plunge us in the flames or from above should intermitted vengeance arm again his red right hand to plague us what if all her stores were opened and this firmament of hell should spout her cataracts of fire impendent horrors threatening hideous fall one day upon our heads while we perhaps designing or exhorting glorious war caught in a fiery tempest shall be hurled each on his rock transfixed the sport and prey or racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk under yon boiling ocean wrapt in chains there to converse with everlasting groans unrespited unpitied unreprieved ages of hopeless end this would be worse war therefore open or concealed alike my voice dissuades for what can force or guile with him or who deceive his mind whose eye views all things at one view he from heaven's height all these our motions vain sees and derides not more almighty to resist our might than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles shall we then live thus vile -- the race of heaven thus trampled thus expelled to suffer here chains and these torments better these than worse by my advice since fate inevitable subdues us and omnipotent decree the victor's will to suffer as to do our strength is equal nor the law unjust that so ordains this was at first resolved if we were wise against so great a foe contending and so doubtful what might fall i laugh when those who at the spear are bold and venturous if that fail them shrink and fear what yet they know must follow -- to endure exile or igominy or bonds or pain the sentence of their conqueror this is now our doom which if we can sustain and bear our supreme foe in time may much remit his anger and perhaps thus far removed not mind us not offending satisfied with what is punished whence these raging fires will slacken if his breath stir not their flames our purer essence then will overcome their noxious vapour or inured not feel or changed at length and to the place conformed in temper and in nature will receive familiar the fierce heat and void of pain this horror will grow mild this darkness light besides what hope the never-ending flight of future days may bring what chance what change worth waiting -- since our present lot appears for happy though but ill for ill not worst if we procure not to ourselves more woe thus belial with words clothed in reason's garb counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth not peace and after him thus mammon spake -- either to disenthrone the king of heaven we war if war be best or to regain our own right lost him to unthrone we then may hope when everlasting fate shall yield to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife the former vain to hope argues as vain the latter for what place can be for us within heaven's bound unless heaven's lord supreme we overpower suppose he should relent and publish grace to all on promise made of new subjection with what eyes could we stand in his presence humble and receive strict laws imposed to celebrate his throne with warbled hymns and to his godhead sing forced hallelujahs while he lordly sits our envied sovereign and his altar breathes ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers our servile offerings this must be our task in heaven this our delight how wearisome eternity so spent in worship paid to whom we hate let us not then pursue by force impossible by leave obtained unacceptable though in heaven our state of splendid vassalage but rather seek our own good from ourselves and from our own live to ourselves though in this vast recess free and to none accountable preferring hard liberty before the easy yoke of servile pomp our greatness will appear then most conspicuous when great things of small useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse we can create and in what place soe'er thrive under evil and work ease out of pain through labour and endurance this deep world of darkness do we dread how oft amidst thick clouds and dark doth heaven's all-ruling sire choose to reside his glory unobscured and with the majesty of darkness round covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar mustering their rage and heaven resembles hell as he our darkness cannot we his light imitate when we please this desert soil wants not her hidden lustre gems and gold nor want we skill or art from whence to raise magnificence and what can heaven show more our torments also may in length of time become our elements these piercing fires as soft as now severe our temper changed into their temper which must needs remove the sensible of pain all things invite to peaceful counsels and the settled state of order how in safety best we may compose our present evils with regard of what we are and where dismissing quite all thoughts of war ye have what i advise he scarce had finished when such murmur filled th' assembly as when hollow rocks retain the sound of blustering winds which all night long had roused the sea now with hoarse cadence lull seafaring men o'erwatched whose bark by chance or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay after the tempest such applause was heard as mammon ended and his sentence pleased advising peace for such another field they dreaded worse than hell so much the fear of thunder and the sword of michael wrought still within them and no less desire to found this nether empire which might rise by policy and long process of time in emulation opposite to heaven which when beelzebub perceived -- than whom satan except none higher sat -- with grave aspect he rose and in his rising seemed a pillar of state deep on his front engraven deliberation sat and public care and princely counsel in his face yet shone majestic though in ruin sage he stood with atlantean shoulders fit to bear the weight of mightiest monarchies his look drew audience and attention still as night or summer's noontide air while thus he spake -- thrones and imperial powers offspring of heaven ethereal virtues or these titles now must we renounce and changing style be called princes of hell for so the popular vote inclines -- here to continue and build up here a growing empire doubtless while we dream and know not that the king of heaven hath doomed this place our dungeon not our safe retreat beyond his potent arm to live exempt from heaven's high jurisdiction in new league banded against his throne but to remain in strictest bondage though thus far removed under th' inevitable curb reserved his captive multitude for he to be sure in height or depth still first and last will reign sole king and of his kingdom lose no part by our revolt but over hell extend his empire and with iron sceptre rule us here as with his golden those in heaven what sit we then projecting peace and war war hath determined us and foiled with loss irreparable terms of peace yet none vouchsafed or sought for what peace will be given to us enslaved but custody severe and stripes and arbitrary punishment inflicted and what peace can we return but to our power hostility and hate untamed reluctance and revenge though slow yet ever plotting how the conqueror least may reap his conquest and may least rejoice in doing what we most in suffering feel nor will occasion want nor shall we need with dangerous expedition to invade heaven whose high walls fear no assault or siege or ambush from the deep what if we find some easier enterprise there is a place if ancient and prophetic fame in heaven err not -- another world the happy seat of some new race called man about this time to be created like to us though less in power and excellence but favoured more of him who rules above so was his will pronounced among the gods and by an oath that shook heaven's whole circumference confirmed thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn what creatures there inhabit of what mould or substance how endued and what their power and where their weakness how attempted best by force of subtlety though heaven be shut and heaven's high arbitrator sit secure in his own strength this place may lie exposed the utmost border of his kingdom left to their defence who hold it here perhaps some advantageous act may be achieved by sudden onset -- either with hell-fire to waste his whole creation or possess all as our own and drive as we were driven the puny habitants or if not drive seduce them to our party that their god may prove their foe and with repenting hand abolish his own works this would surpass common revenge and interrupt his joy in our confusion and our joy upraise in his disturbance when his darling sons hurled headlong to partake with us shall curse their frail original and faded bliss -- faded so soon advise if this be worth attempting or to sit in darkness here hatching vain empires thus beelzebub pleaded his devilish counsel -- first devised by satan and in part proposed for whence but from the author of all ill could spring so deep a malice to confound the race of mankind in one root and earth with hell to mingle and involve done all to spite the great creator but their spite still serves his glory to augment the bold design pleased highly those infernal states and joy sparkled in all their eyes with full assent they vote whereat his speech he thus renews -- well have ye judged well ended long debate synod of gods and like to what ye are great things resolved which from the lowest deep will once more lift us up in spite of fate nearer our ancient seat -- perhaps in view of those bright confines whence with neighbouring arms and opportune excursion we may chance re-enter heaven or else in some mild zone dwell not unvisited of heaven's fair light secure and at the brightening orient beam purge off this gloom the soft delicious air to heal the scar of these corrosive fires shall breathe her balm but first whom shall we send in search of this new world whom shall we find sufficient who shall tempt with wandering feet the dark unbottomed infinite abyss and through the palpable obscure find out his uncouth way or spread his airy flight upborne with indefatigable wings over the vast abrupt ere he arrive the happy isle what strength what art can then suffice or what evasion bear him safe through the strict senteries and stations thick of angels watching round here he had need all circumspection and we now no less choice in our suffrage for on whom we send the weight of all and our last hope relies this said he sat and expectation held his look suspense awaiting who appeared to second or oppose or undertake the perilous attempt but all sat mute pondering the danger with deep thoughts and each in other's countenance read his own dismay astonished none among the choice and prime of those heaven-warring champions could be found so hardy as to proffer or accept alone the dreadful voyage till at last satan whom now transcendent glory raised above his fellows with monarchal pride conscious of highest worth unmoved thus spake -- o progeny of heaven empyreal thrones with reason hath deep silence and demur seized us though undismayed long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to light our prison strong this huge convex of fire outrageous to devour immures us round ninefold and gates of burning adamant barred over us prohibit all egress these passed if any pass the void profound of unessential night receives him next wide-gaping and with utter loss of being threatens him plunged in that abortive gulf if thence he scape into whatever world or unknown region what remains him less than unknown dangers and as hard escape but i should ill become this throne o peers and this imperial sovereignty adorned with splendour armed with power if aught proposed and judged of public moment in the shape of difficulty or danger could deter me from attempting wherefore do i assume these royalties and not refuse to reign refusing to accept as great a share of hazard as of honour due alike to him who reigns and so much to him due of hazard more as he above the rest high honoured sits go therefore mighty powers terror of heaven though fallen intend at home while here shall be our home what best may ease the present misery and render hell more tolerable if there be cure or charm to respite or deceive or slack the pain of this ill mansion intermit no watch against a wakeful foe while i abroad through all the coasts of dark destruction seek deliverance for us all this enterprise none shall partake with me thus saying rose the monarch and prevented all reply prudent lest from his resolution raised others among the chief might offer now certain to be refused what erst they feared and so refused might in opinion stand his rivals winning cheap the high repute which he through hazard huge must earn but they dreaded not more th' adventure than his voice forbidding and at once with him they rose their rising all at once was as the sound of thunder heard remote towards him they bend with awful reverence prone and as a god extol him equal to the highest in heaven nor failed they to express how much they praised that for the general safety he despised his own for neither do the spirits damned lose all their virtue lest bad men should boast their specious deeds on earth which glory excites or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal thus they their doubtful consultations dark ended rejoicing in their matchless chief as when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds ascending while the north wind sleeps o'erspread heaven's cheerful face the louring element scowls o'er the darkened landscape snow or shower if chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet extend his evening beam the fields revive the birds their notes renew and bleating herds attest their joy that hill and valley rings o shame to men devil with devil damned firm concord holds men only disagree of creatures rational though under hope of heavenly grace and god proclaiming peace yet live in hatred enmity and strife among themselves and levy cruel wars wasting the earth each other to destroy as if which might induce us to accord man had not hellish foes enow besides that day and night for his destruction wait the stygian council thus dissolved and forth in order came the grand infernal peers midst came their mighty paramount and seemed alone th' antagonist of heaven nor less than hell's dread emperor with pomp supreme and god-like imitated state him round a globe of fiery seraphim enclosed with bright emblazonry and horrent arms then of their session ended they bid cry with trumpet's regal sound the great result toward the four winds four speedy cherubim put to their mouths the sounding alchemy by herald's voice explained the hollow abyss heard far adn wide and all the host of hell with deafening shout returned them loud acclaim thence more at ease their minds and somewhat raised by false presumptuous hope the ranged powers disband and wandering each his several way pursues as inclination or sad choice leads him perplexed where he may likeliest find truce to his restless thoughts and entertain the irksome hours till his great chief return part on the plain or in the air sublime upon the wing or in swift race contend as at th' olympian games or pythian fields part curb their fiery steeds or shun the goal with rapid wheels or fronted brigades form as when to warn proud cities war appears waged in the troubled sky and armies rush to battle in the clouds before each van prick forth the airy knights and couch their spears till thickest legions close with feats of arms from either end of heaven the welkin burns others with vast typhoean rage more fell rend up both rocks and hills and ride the air in whirlwind hell scarce holds the wild uproar -- as when alcides from oechalia crowned with conquest felt th' envenomed robe and tore through pain up by the roots thessalian pines and lichas from the top of oeta threw into th' euboic sea others more mild retreated in a silent valley sing with notes angelical to many a harp their own heroic deeds and hapless fall by doom of battle and complain that fate free virtue should enthrall to force or chance their song was partial but the harmony what could it less when spirits immortal sing suspended hell and took with ravishment the thronging audience in discourse more sweet for eloquence the soul song charms the sense others apart sat on a hill retired in thoughts more elevate and reasoned high of providence foreknowledge will and fate -- fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute and found no end in wandering mazes lost of good and evil much they argued then of happiness and final misery passion and apathy and glory and shame vain wisdom all and false philosophy -- yet with a pleasing sorcery could charm pain for a while or anguish and excite fallacious hope or arm th' obdured breast with stubborn patience as with triple steel another part in squadrons and gross bands on bold adventure to discover wide that dismal world if any clime perhaps might yield them easier habitation bend four ways their flying march along the banks of four infernal rivers that disgorge into the burning lake their baleful streams -- abhorred styx the flood of deadly hate sad acheron of sorrow black and deep cocytus named of lamentation loud heard on the rueful stream fierce phlegeton whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage far off from these a slow and silent stream lethe the river of oblivion rolls her watery labyrinth whereof who drinks forthwith his former state and being forgets -- forgets both joy and grief pleasure and pain beyond this flood a frozen continent lies dark and wild beat with perpetual storms of whirlwind and dire hail which on firm land thaws not but gathers heap and ruin seems of ancient pile all else deep snow and ice a gulf profound as that serbonian bog betwixt damiata and mount casius old where armies whole have sunk the parching air burns frore and cold performs th' effect of fire thither by harpy-footed furies haled at certain revolutions all the damned are brought and feel by turns the bitter change of fierce extremes extremes by change more fierce from beds of raging fire to starve in ice their soft ethereal warmth and there to pine immovable infixed and frozen round periods of time -- thence hurried back to fire they ferry over this lethean sound both to and fro their sorrow to augment and wish and struggle as they pass to reach the tempting stream with one small drop to lose in sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe all in one moment and so near the brink but fate withstands and to oppose th' attempt medusa with gorgonian terror guards the ford and of itself the water flies all taste of living wight as once it fled the lip of tantalus thus roving on in confused march forlorn th' adventurous bands with shuddering horror pale and eyes aghast viewed first their lamentable lot and found no rest through many a dark and dreary vale they passed and many a region dolorous o'er many a frozen many a fiery alp rocks caves lakes fens bogs dens and shades of death -- a universe of death which god by curse created evil for evil only good where all life dies death lives and nature breeds perverse all monstrous all prodigious things obominable inutterable and worse than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived gorgons and hydras and chimeras dire meanwhile the adversary of god and man satan with thoughts inflamed of highest design puts on swift wings and toward the gates of hell explores his solitary flight sometimes he scours the right hand coast sometimes the left now shaves with level wing the deep then soars up to the fiery concave towering high as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial winds close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate and tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend at last appear hell-bounds high reaching to the horrid roof and thrice threefold the gates three folds were brass three iron three of adamantine rock impenetrable impaled with circling fire yet unconsumed before the gates there sat on either side a formidable shape the one seemed woman to the waist and fair but ended foul in many a scaly fold voluminous and vast -- a serpent armed with mortal sting about her middle round a cry of hell-hounds never-ceasing barked with wide cerberean mouths full loud and rung a hideous peal yet when they list would creep if aught disturbed their noise into her womb and kennel there yet there still barked and howled within unseen far less abhorred than these vexed scylla bathing in the sea that parts calabria from the hoarse trinacrian shore nor uglier follow the night-hag when called in secret riding through the air she comes lured with the smell of infant blood to dance with lapland witches while the labouring moon eclipses at their charms the other shape -- if shape it might be called that shape had none distinguishable in member joint or limb or substance might be called that shadow seemed for each seemed either -- black it stood as night fierce as ten furies terrible as hell and shook a dreadful dart what seemed his head the likeness of a kingly crown had on satan was now at hand and from his seat the monster moving onward came as fast with horrid strides hell trembled as he strode th' undaunted fiend what this might be admired -- admired not feared god and his son except created thing naught valued he nor shunned and with disdainful look thus first began -- whence and what art thou execrable shape that dar'st though grim and terrible advance thy miscreated front athwart my way to yonder gates through them i mean to pass that be assured without leave asked of thee retire or taste thy folly and learn by proof hell-born not to contend with spirits of heaven to whom the goblin full of wrath replied -- art thou that traitor angel art thou he who first broke peace in heaven and faith till then unbroken and in proud rebellious arms drew after him the third part of heaven's sons conjured against the highest -- for which both thou and they outcast from god are here condemned to waste eternal days in woe and pain and reckon'st thou thyself with spirits of heaven hell-doomed and breath'st defiance here and scorn where i reign king and to enrage thee more thy king and lord back to thy punishment false fugitive and to thy speed add wings lest with a whip of scorpions i pursue thy lingering or with one stroke of this dart strange horror seize thee and pangs unfelt before so spake the grisly terror and in shape so speaking and so threatening grew tenfold more dreadful and deform on th' other side incensed with indignation satan stood unterrified and like a comet burned that fires the length of ophiuchus huge in th' arctic sky and from his horrid hair shakes pestilence and war each at the head levelled his deadly aim their fatal hands no second stroke intend and such a frown each cast at th' other as when two black clouds with heaven's artillery fraught came rattling on over the caspian -- then stand front to front hovering a space till winds the signal blow to join their dark encounter in mid-air so frowned the mighty combatants that hell grew darker at their frown so matched they stood for never but once more was wither like to meet so great a foe and now great deeds had been achieved whereof all hell had rung had not the snaky sorceress that sat fast by hell-gate and kept the fatal key risen and with hideous outcry rushed between o father what intends thy hand she cried against thy only son what fury o son possesses thee to bend that mortal dart against thy father's head and know'st for whom for him who sits above and laughs the while at thee ordained his drudge to execute whate'er his wrath which he calls justice bids -- his wrath which one day will destroy ye both she spake and at her words the hellish pest forbore then these to her satan returned -- so strange thy outcry and thy words so strange thou interposest that my sudden hand prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds what it intends till first i know of thee what thing thou art thus double-formed and why in this infernal vale first met thou call'st me father and that phantasm call'st my son i know thee not nor ever saw till now sight more detestable than him and thee t' whom thus the portress of hell-gate replied -- hast thou forgot me then and do i seem now in thine eye so foul -- once deemed so fair in heaven when at th' assembly and in sight of all the seraphim with thee combined in bold conspiracy against heaven's king all on a sudden miserable pain surprised thee dim thine eyes and dizzy swum in darkness while thy head flames thick and fast threw forth till on the left side opening wide likest to thee in shape and countenance bright then shining heavenly fair a goddess armed out of thy head i sprung amazement seized all th' host of heaven back they recoiled afraid at first and called me sin and for a sign portentous held me but familiar grown i pleased and with attractive graces won the most averse -- thee chiefly who full oft thyself in me thy perfect image viewing becam'st enamoured and such joy thou took'st with me in secret that my womb conceived a growing burden meanwhile war arose and fields were fought in heaven wherein remained for what could else to our almighty foe clear victory to our part loss and rout through all the empyrean down they fell driven headlong from the pitch of heaven down into this deep and in the general fall i also at which time this powerful key into my hands was given with charge to keep these gates for ever shut which none can pass without my opening pensive here i sat alone but long i sat not till my womb pregnant by thee and now excessive grown prodigious motion felt and rueful throes at last this odious offspring whom thou seest thine own begotten breaking violent way tore through my entrails that with fear and pain distorted all my nether shape thus grew transformed but he my inbred enemy forth issued brandishing his fatal dart made to destroy i fled and cried out death hell trembled at the hideous name and sighed from all her caves and back resounded death i fled but he pursued though more it seems inflamed with lust than rage and swifter far me overtook his mother all dismayed and in embraces forcible and foul engendering with me of that rape begot these yelling monsters that with ceaseless cry surround me as thou saw'st -- hourly conceived and hourly born with sorrow infinite to me for when they list into the womb that bred them they return and howl and gnaw my bowels their repast then bursting forth afresh with conscious terrors vex me round that rest or intermission none i find before mine eyes in opposition sits grim death my son and foe who set them on and me his parent would full soon devour for want of other prey but that he knows his end with mine involved and knows that i should prove a bitter morsel and his bane whenever that shall be so fate pronounced but thou o father i forewarn thee shun his deadly arrow neither vainly hope to be invulnerable in those bright arms through tempered heavenly for that mortal dint save he who reigns above none can resist she finished and the subtle fiend his lore soon learned now milder and thus answered smooth -- dear daughter -- since thou claim'st me for thy sire and my fair son here show'st me the dear pledge of dalliance had with thee in heaven and joys then sweet now sad to mention through dire change befallen us unforeseen unthought-of -- know i come no enemy but to set free from out this dark and dismal house of pain both him and thee and all the heavenly host of spirits that in our just pretences armed fell with us from on high from them i go this uncouth errand sole and one for all myself expose with lonely steps to tread th' unfounded deep and through the void immense to search with wandering quest a place foretold should be -- and by concurring signs ere now created vast and round -- a place of bliss in the purlieus of heaven and therein placed a race of upstart creatures to supply perhaps our vacant room though more removed lest heaven surcharged with potent multitude might hap to move new broils be this or aught than this more secret now designed i haste to know and this once known shall soon return and bring ye to the place where thou and death shall dwell at ease and up and down unseen wing silently the buxom air embalmed with odours there ye shall be fed and filled immeasurably all things shall be your prey he ceased for both seemed highly pleased and death grinned horrible a ghastly smile to hear his famine should be filled and blessed his maw destined to that good hour no less rejoiced his mother bad and thus bespake her sire -- the key of this infernal pit by due and by command of heaven's all-powerful king i keep by him forbidden to unlock these adamantine gates against all force death ready stands to interpose his dart fearless to be o'ermatched by living might but what owe i to his commands above who hates me and hath hither thrust me down into this gloom of tartarus profound to sit in hateful office here confined inhabitant of heaven and heavenly born -- here in perpetual agony and pain with terrors and with clamours compassed round of mine own brood that on my bowels feed thou art my father thou my author thou my being gav'st me whom should i obey but thee whom follow thou wilt bring me soon to that new world of light and bliss among the gods who live at ease where i shall reign at thy right hand voluptuous as beseems thy daughter and thy darling without end thus saying from her side the fatal key sad instrument of all our woe she took and towards the gate rolling her bestial train forthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew which but herself not all the stygian powers could once have moved then in the key-hole turns th' intricate wards and every bolt and bar of massy iron or solid rock with ease unfastens on a sudden open fly with impetuous recoil and jarring sound th' infernal doors and on their hinges grate harsh thunder that the lowest bottom shook of erebus she opened but to shut excelled her power the gates wide open stood that with extended wings a bannered host under spread ensigns marching mibht pass through with horse and chariots ranked in loose array so wide they stood and like a furnace-mouth cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame before their eyes in sudden view appear the secrets of the hoary deep -- a dark illimitable ocean without bound without dimension where length breadth and height and time and place are lost where eldest night and chaos ancestors of nature hold eternal anarchy amidst the noise of endless wars and by confusion stand for hot cold moist and dry four champions fierce strive here for mastery and to battle bring their embryon atoms they around the flag of each his faction in their several clans light-armed or heavy sharp smooth swift or slow swarm populous unnumbered as the sands of barca or cyrene's torrid soil levied to side with warring winds and poise their lighter wings to whom these most adhere he rules a moment chaos umpire sits and by decision more embroils the fray by which he reigns next him high arbiter chance governs all into this wild abyss the womb of nature and perhaps her grave of neither sea nor shore nor air nor fire but all these in their pregnant causes mixed confusedly and which thus must ever fight unless th' almighty maker them ordain his dark materials to create more worlds -- into this wild abyss the wary fiend stood on the brink of hell and looked a while pondering his voyage for no narrow frith he had to cross nor was his ear less pealed with noises loud and ruinous to compare great things with small than when bellona storms with all her battering engines bent to rase some capital city or less than if this frame of heaven were falling and these elements in mutiny had from her axle torn the steadfast earth at last his sail-broad vans he spread for flight and in the surging smoke uplifted spurns the ground thence many a league as in a cloudy chair ascending rides audacious but that seat soon failing meets a vast vacuity all unawares fluttering his pennons vain plumb-down he drops ten thousand fathom deep and to this hour down had been falling had not by ill chance the strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud instinct with fire and nitre hurried him as many miles aloft that fury stayed -- quenched in a boggy syrtis neither sea nor good dry land -- nigh foundered on he fares treading the crude consistence half on foot half flying behoves him now both oar and sail as when a gryphon through the wilderness with winged course o'er hill or moory dale pursues the arimaspian who by stealth had from his wakeful custody purloined the guarded gold so eagerly the fiend o'er bog or steep through strait rough dense or rare with head hands wings or feet pursues his way and swims or sinks or wades or creeps or flies at length a universal hubbub wild of stunning sounds and voices all confused borne through the hollow dark assaults his ear with loudest vehemence thither he plies undaunted to meet there whatever power or spirit of the nethermost abyss might in that noise reside of whom to ask which way the nearest coast of darkness lies bordering on light when straight behold the throne of chaos and his dark pavilion spread wide on the wasteful deep with him enthroned sat sable-vested night eldest of things the consort of his reign and by them stood orcus and ades and the dreaded name of demogorgon rumour next and chance and tumult and confusion all embroiled and discord with a thousand various mouths t' whom satan turning boldly thus -- ye powers and spirtis of this nethermost abyss chaos and ancient night i come no spy with purpose to explore or to disturb the secrets of your realm but by constraint wandering this darksome desert as my way lies through your spacious empire up to light alone and without guide half lost i seek what readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds confine with heaven or if some other place from your dominion won th' ethereal king possesses lately thither to arrive i travel this profound direct my course directed no mean recompense it brings to your behoof if i that region lost all usurpation thence expelled reduce to her original darkness and your sway which is my present journey and once more erect the standard there of ancient night yours be th' advantage all mine the revenge thus satan and him thus the anarch old with faltering speech and visage incomposed answered i know thee stranger who thou art -- that mighty leading angel who of late made head against heaven's king though overthrown i saw and heard for such a numerous host fled not in silence through the frighted deep with ruin upon ruin rout on rout confusion worse confounded and heaven-gates poured out by millions her victorious bands pursuing i upon my frontiers here keep residence if all i can will serve that little which is left so to defend encroached on still through our intestine broils weakening the sceptre of old night first hell your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath now lately heaven and earth another world hung o'er my realm linked in a golden chain to that side heaven from whence your legions fell if that way be your walk you have not far so much the nearer danger go and speed havoc and spoil and ruin are my gain he ceased and satan stayed not to reply but glad that now his sea should find a shore with fresh alacrity and force renewed springs upward like a pyramid of fire into the wild expanse and through the shock of fighting elements on all sides round environed wins his way harder beset and more endangered than when argo passed through bosporus betwixt the justling rocks or when ulysses on the larboard shunned charybdis and by th' other whirlpool steered so he with difficulty and labour hard moved on with difficulty and labour he but he once passed soon after when man fell strange alteration sin and death amain following his track such was the will of heaven paved after him a broad and beaten way over the dark abyss whose boiling gulf tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length from hell continued reaching th' utmost orb of this frail world by which the spirits perverse with easy intercourse pass to and fro to tempt or punish mortals except whom god and good angels guard by special grace but now at last the sacred influence of light appears and from the walls of heaven shoots far into the bosom of dim night a glimmering dawn here nature first begins her farthest verge and chaos to retire as from her outmost works a broken foe with tumult less and with less hostile din that satan with less toil and now with ease wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light and like a weather-beaten vessel holds gladly the port though shrouds and tackle torn or in the emptier waste resembling air weighs his spread wings at leisure to behold far off th' empyreal heaven extended wide in circuit undetermined square or round with opal towers and battlements adorned of living sapphire once his native seat and fast by hanging in a golden chain this pendent world in bigness as a star of smallest magnitude close by the moon thither full fraught with mischievous revenge accursed and in a cursed hour he hies book iii hail holy light offspring of heaven firstborn or of the eternal coeternal beam may i express thee unblam'd since god is light and never but in unapproached light dwelt from eternity dwelt then in thee bright effluence of bright essence increate or hear st thou rather pure ethereal stream whose fountain who shall tell before the sun before the heavens thou wert and at the voice of god as with a mantle didst invest the rising world of waters dark and deep won from the void and formless infinite thee i re-visit now with bolder wing escap'd the stygian pool though long detain'd in that obscure sojourn while in my flight through utter and through middle darkness borne with other notes than to the orphean lyre i sung of chaos and eternal night taught by the heavenly muse to venture down the dark descent and up to re-ascend though hard and rare thee i revisit safe and feel thy sovran vital lamp but thou revisit'st not these eyes that roll in vain to find thy piercing ray and find no dawn so thick a drop serene hath quench'd their orbs or dim suffusion veil'd yet not the more cease i to wander where the muses haunt clear spring or shady grove or sunny hill smit with the love of sacred song but chief thee sion and the flowery brooks beneath that wash thy hallow'd feet and warbling flow nightly i visit nor sometimes forget so were i equall'd with them in renown thy sovran command that man should find grace blind thamyris and blind maeonides and tiresias and phineus prophets old then feed on thoughts that voluntary move harmonious numbers as the wakeful bird sings darkling and in shadiest covert hid tunes her nocturnal note thus with the year seasons return but not to me returns day or the sweet approach of even or morn or sight of vernal bloom or summer's rose or flocks or herds or human face divine but cloud instead and ever-during dark surrounds me from the cheerful ways of men cut off and for the book of knowledge fair presented with a universal blank of nature's works to me expung'd and ras'd and wisdom at one entrance quite shut out so much the rather thou celestial light shine inward and the mind through all her powers irradiate there plant eyes all mist from thence purge and disperse that i may see and tell of things invisible to mortal sight now had the almighty father from above from the pure empyrean where he sits high thron'd above all highth bent down his eye his own works and their works at once to view about him all the sanctities of heaven stood thick as stars and from his sight receiv'd beatitude past utterance on his right the radiant image of his glory sat his only son on earth he first beheld our two first parents yet the only two of mankind in the happy garden plac'd reaping immortal fruits of joy and love uninterrupted joy unrivall'd love in blissful solitude he then survey'd hell and the gulf between and satan there coasting the wall of heaven on this side night in the dun air sublime and ready now to stoop with wearied wings and willing feet on the bare outside of this world that seem'd firm land imbosom'd without firmament uncertain which in ocean or in air him god beholding from his prospect high wherein past present future he beholds thus to his only son foreseeing spake only begotten son seest thou what rage transports our adversary whom no bounds prescrib'd no bars of hell nor all the chains heap'd on him there nor yet the main abyss wide interrupt can hold so bent he seems on desperate revenge that shall redound upon his own rebellious head and now through all restraint broke loose he wings his way not far off heaven in the precincts of light directly towards the new created world and man there plac'd with purpose to assay if him by force he can destroy or worse by some false guile pervert and shall pervert for man will hearken to his glozing lies and easily transgress the sole command sole pledge of his obedience so will fall he and his faithless progeny whose fault whose but his own ingrate he had of me all he could have i made him just and right sufficient to have stood though free to fall such i created all the ethereal powers and spirits both them who stood and them who fail'd freely they stood who stood and fell who fell not free what proof could they have given sincere of true allegiance constant faith or love where only what they needs must do appear'd not what they would what praise could they receive what pleasure i from such obedience paid when will and reason reason also is choice useless and vain of freedom both despoil'd made passive both had serv'd necessity not me they therefore as to right belong 'd so were created nor can justly accuse their maker or their making or their fate as if predestination over-rul'd their will dispos'd by absolute decree or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed their own revolt not i if i foreknew foreknowledge had no influence on their fault which had no less proved certain unforeknown so without least impulse or shadow of fate or aught by me immutably foreseen they trespass authors to themselves in all both what they judge and what they choose for so i form'd them free and free they must remain till they enthrall themselves i else must change their nature and revoke the high decree unchangeable eternal which ordain'd their freedom they themselves ordain'd their fall the first sort by their own suggestion fell self-tempted self-deprav'd man falls deceiv'd by the other first man therefore shall find grace the other none in mercy and justice both through heaven and earth so shall my glory excel but mercy first and last shall brightest shine thus while god spake ambrosial fragrance fill'd all heaven and in the blessed spirits elect sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd beyond compare the son of god was seen most glorious in him all his father shone substantially express'd and in his face divine compassion visibly appear'd love without end and without measure grace which uttering thus he to his father spake o father gracious was that word which clos'd thy sovran command that man should find grace that man should find grace for which both heaven and earth shall high extol thy praises with the innumerable sound of hymns and sacred songs wherewith thy throne encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest for should man finally be lost should man thy creature late so lov'd thy youngest son fall circumvented thus by fraud though join'd with his own folly that be from thee far that far be from thee father who art judge of all things made and judgest only right or shall the adversary thus obtain his end and frustrate thine shall he fulfill his malice and thy goodness bring to nought or proud return though to his heavier doom yet with revenge accomplish'd and to hell draw after him the whole race of mankind by him corrupted or wilt thou thyself abolish thy creation and unmake for him what for thy glory thou hast made so should thy goodness and thy greatness both be question'd and blasphem'd without defence to whom the great creator thus replied o son in whom my soul hath chief delight son of my bosom son who art alone my word my wisdom and effectual might all hast thou spoken as my thoughts are all as my eternal purpose hath decreed man shall not quite be lost but sav'd who will yet not of will in him but grace in me freely vouchsaf'd once more i will renew his lapsed powers though forfeit and enthrall'd by sin to foul exorbitant desires upheld by me yet once more he shall stand on even ground against his mortal foe by me upheld that he may know how frail his fallen condition is and to me owe all his deliverance and to none but me some i have chosen of peculiar grace elect above the rest so is my will the rest shall hear me call and oft be warn'd their sinful state and to appease betimes the incensed deity while offer'd grace invites for i will clear their senses dark what may suffice and soften stony hearts to pray repent and bring obedience due to prayer repentance and obedience due though but endeavour'd with sincere intent mine ear shall not be slow mine eye not shut and i will place within them as a guide my umpire conscience whom if they will hear light after light well us'd they shall attain and to the end persisting safe arrive this my long sufferance and my day of grace they who neglect and scorn shall never taste but hard be harden'd blind be blinded more that they may stumble on and deeper fall and none but such from mercy i exclude but yet all is not done man disobeying disloyal breaks his fealty and sins against the high supremacy of heaven affecting god-head and so losing all to expiate his treason hath nought left but to destruction sacred and devote he with his whole posterity must die die he or justice must unless for him some other able and as willing pay the rigid satisfaction death for death say heavenly powers where shall we find such love which of you will be mortal to redeem man's mortal crime and just the unjust to save dwells in all heaven charity so dear and silence was in heaven on man's behalf he ask'd but all the heavenly quire stood mute patron or intercessour none appear'd much less that durst upon his own head draw the deadly forfeiture and ransom set and now without redemption all mankind must have been lost adjudg'd to death and hell by doom severe had not the son of god in whom the fulness dwells of love divine his dearest mediation thus renew'd father thy word is past man shall find grace and shall grace not find means that finds her way the speediest of thy winged messengers to visit all thy creatures and to all comes unprevented unimplor'd unsought happy for man so coming he her aid can never seek once dead in sins and lost atonement for himself or offering meet indebted and undone hath none to bring behold me then me for him life for life i offer on me let thine anger fall account me man i for his sake will leave thy bosom and this glory next to thee freely put off and for him lastly die well pleased on me let death wreak all his rage under his gloomy power i shall not long lie vanquished thou hast given me to possess life in myself for ever by thee i live though now to death i yield and am his due all that of me can die yet that debt paid thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave his prey nor suffer my unspotted soul for ever with corruption there to dwell but i shall rise victorious and subdue my vanquisher spoiled of his vaunted spoil death his death's wound shall then receive and stoop inglorious of his mortal sting disarmed i through the ample air in triumph high shall lead hell captive maugre hell and show the powers of darkness bound thou at the sight pleased out of heaven shalt look down and smile while by thee raised i ruin all my foes death last and with his carcase glut the grave then with the multitude of my redeemed shall enter heaven long absent and return father to see thy face wherein no cloud of anger shall remain but peace assured and reconcilement wrath shall be no more thenceforth but in thy presence joy entire his words here ended but his meek aspect silent yet spake and breathed immortal love to mortal men above which only shone filial obedience as a sacrifice glad to be offered he attends the will of his great father admiration seized all heaven what this might mean and whither tend wondering but soon th' almighty thus replied o thou in heaven and earth the only peace found out for mankind under wrath o thou my sole complacence well thou know'st how dear to me are all my works nor man the least though last created that for him i spare thee from my bosom and right hand to save by losing thee a while the whole race lost 00021053 thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem their nature also to thy nature join and be thyself man among men on earth made flesh when time shall be of virgin seed by wondrous birth be thou in adam's room the head of all mankind though adam's son as in him perish all men so in thee as from a second root shall be restored as many as are restored without thee none his crime makes guilty all his sons thy merit imputed shall absolve them who renounce their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds and live in thee transplanted and from thee receive new life so man as is most just shall satisfy for man be judged and die and dying rise and rising with him raise his brethren ransomed with his own dear life so heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate giving to death and dying to redeem so dearly to redeem what hellish hate so easily destroyed and still destroys in those who when they may accept not grace nor shalt thou by descending to assume man's nature lessen or degrade thine own because thou hast though throned in highest bliss equal to god and equally enjoying god-like fruition quitted all to save a world from utter loss and hast been found by merit more than birthright son of god found worthiest to be so by being good far more than great or high because in thee love hath abounded more than glory abounds therefore thy humiliation shall exalt with thee thy manhood also to this throne here shalt thou sit incarnate here shalt reign both god and man son both of god and man anointed universal king all power i give thee reign for ever and assume thy merits under thee as head supreme thrones princedoms powers dominions i reduce all knees to thee shall bow of them that bide in heaven or earth or under earth in hell when thou attended gloriously from heaven shalt in the sky appear and from thee send the summoning arch-angels to proclaim thy dread tribunal forthwith from all winds the living and forthwith the cited dead of all past ages to the general doom shall hasten such a peal shall rouse their sleep then all thy saints assembled thou shalt judge bad men and angels they arraigned shall sink beneath thy sentence hell her numbers full thenceforth shall be for ever shut mean while the world shall burn and from her ashes spring new heaven and earth wherein the just shall dwell and after all their tribulations long see golden days fruitful of golden deeds with joy and peace triumphing and fair truth then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by for regal scepter then no more shall need god shall be all in all but all ye gods adore him who to compass all this dies adore the son and honour him as me no sooner had the almighty ceased but all the multitude of angels with a shout loud as from numbers without number sweet as from blest voices uttering joy heaven rung with jubilee and loud hosannas filled the eternal regions lowly reverent towards either throne they bow and to the ground with solemn adoration down they cast their crowns inwove with amarant and gold immortal amarant a flower which once in paradise fast by the tree of life began to bloom but soon for man's offence to heaven removed where first it grew there grows and flowers aloft shading the fount of life and where the river of bliss through midst of heaven rolls o'er elysian flowers her amber stream with these that never fade the spirits elect bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams now in loose garlands thick thrown off the bright pavement that like a sea of jasper shone impurpled with celestial roses smiled then crowned again their golden harps they took harps ever tuned that glittering by their side like quivers hung and with preamble sweet of charming symphony they introduce their sacred song and waken raptures high no voice exempt no voice but well could join melodious part such concord is in heaven thee father first they sung omnipotent immutable immortal infinite eternal king the author of all being fonntain of light thyself invisible amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st throned inaccessible but when thou shadest the full blaze of thy beams and through a cloud drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear yet dazzle heaven that brightest seraphim approach not but with both wings veil their eyes thee next they sang of all creation first begotten son divine similitude in whose conspicuous countenance without cloud made visible the almighty father shines whom else no creature can behold on thee impressed the effulgence of his glory abides transfused on thee his ample spirit rests he heaven of heavens and all the powers therein by thee created and by thee threw down the aspiring dominations thou that day thy father's dreadful thunder didst not spare nor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels that shook heaven's everlasting frame while o'er the necks thou drovest of warring angels disarrayed back from pursuit thy powers with loud acclaim thee only extolled son of thy father's might to execute fierce vengeance on his foes not so on man him through their malice fallen father of mercy and grace thou didst not doom so strictly but much more to pity incline no sooner did thy dear and only son perceive thee purposed not to doom frail man so strictly but much more to pity inclined he to appease thy wrath and end the strife of mercy and justice in thy face discerned regardless of the bliss wherein he sat second to thee offered himself to die for man's offence o unexampled love love no where to be found less than divine hail son of god saviour of men thy name shall be the copious matter of my song henceforth and never shall my heart thy praise forget nor from thy father's praise disjoin thus they in heaven above the starry sphere their happy hours in joy and hymning spent mean while upon the firm opacous globe of this round world whose first convex divides the luminous inferiour orbs enclosed from chaos and the inroad of darkness old satan alighted walks a globe far off it seemed now seems a boundless continent dark waste and wild under the frown of night starless exposed and ever-threatening storms of chaos blustering round inclement sky save on that side which from the wall of heaven though distant far some small reflection gains of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud here walked the fiend at large in spacious field as when a vultur on imaus bred whose snowy ridge the roving tartar bounds dislodging from a region scarce of prey to gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids on hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs of ganges or hydaspes indian streams but in his way lights on the barren plains of sericana where chineses drive with sails and wind their cany waggons light so on this windy sea of land the fiend walked up and down alone bent on his prey alone for other creature in this place living or lifeless to be found was none none yet but store hereafter from the earth up hither like aereal vapours flew of all things transitory and vain when sin with vanity had filled the works of men both all things vain and all who in vain things built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame or happiness in this or the other life all who have their reward on earth the fruits of painful superstition and blind zeal nought seeking but the praise of men here find fit retribution empty as their deeds all the unaccomplished works of nature's hand abortive monstrous or unkindly mixed dissolved on earth fleet hither and in vain till final dissolution wander here not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed those argent fields more likely habitants translated saints or middle spirits hold betwixt the angelical and human kind hither of ill-joined sons and daughters born first from the ancient world those giants came with many a vain exploit though then renowned the builders next of babel on the plain of sennaar and still with vain design new babels had they wherewithal would build others came single he who to be deemed a god leaped fondly into aetna flames empedocles and he who to enjoy plato's elysium leaped into the sea cleombrotus and many more too long embryos and idiots eremites and friars white black and gray with all their trumpery here pilgrims roam that strayed so far to seek in golgotha him dead who lives in heaven and they who to be sure of paradise dying put on the weeds of dominick or in franciscan think to pass disguised they pass the planets seven and pass the fixed and that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs the trepidation talked and that first moved and now saint peter at heaven's wicket seems to wait them with his keys and now at foot of heaven's ascent they lift their feet when lo a violent cross wind from either coast blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry into the devious air then might ye see cowls hoods and habits with their wearers tost and fluttered into rags then reliques beads indulgences dispenses pardons bulls the sport of winds all these upwhirled aloft fly o'er the backside of the world far off into a limbo large and broad since called the paradise of fools to few unknown long after now unpeopled and untrod all this dark globe the fiend found as he passed and long he wandered till at last a gleam of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste his travelled steps far distant he descries ascending by degrees magnificent up to the wall of heaven a structure high at top whereof but far more rich appeared the work as of a kingly palace-gate with frontispiece of diamond and gold embellished thick with sparkling orient gems the portal shone inimitable on earth by model or by shading pencil drawn these stairs were such as whereon jacob saw angels ascending and descending bands of guardians bright when he from esau fled to padan-aram in the field of luz dreaming by night under the open sky and waking cried this is the gate of heaven each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood there always but drawn up to heaven sometimes viewless and underneath a bright sea flowed of jasper or of liquid pearl whereon who after came from earth failing arrived wafted by angels or flew o'er the lake rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds the stairs were then let down whether to dare the fiend by easy ascent or aggravate his sad exclusion from the doors of bliss direct against which opened from beneath just o'er the blissful seat of paradise a passage down to the earth a passage wide wider by far than that of after-times over mount sion and though that were large over the promised land to god so dear by which to visit oft those happy tribes on high behests his angels to and fro passed frequent and his eye with choice regard from paneas the fount of jordan's flood to beersaba where the holy land borders on egypt and the arabian shore so wide the opening seemed where bounds were set to darkness such as bound the ocean wave satan from hence now on the lower stair that scaled by steps of gold to heaven-gate looks down with wonder at the sudden view of all this world at once as when a scout through dark nd desart ways with oeril gone all might t kast by break of cheerful dawn obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill which to his eye discovers unaware the goodly prospect of some foreign land first seen or some renowned metropolis with glistering spires and pinnacles adorned which now the rising sun gilds with his beams such wonder seised though after heaven seen the spirit malign but much more envy seised at sight of all this world beheld so fair round he surveys and well might where he stood so high above the circling canopy of night's extended shade from eastern point of libra to the fleecy star that bears andromeda far off atlantick seas beyond the horizon then from pole to pole he views in breadth and without longer pause down right into the world's first region throws his flight precipitant and winds with ease through the pure marble air his oblique way amongst innumerable stars that shone stars distant but nigh hand seemed other worlds or other worlds they seemed or happy isles like those hesperian gardens famed of old fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales thrice happy isles but who dwelt happy there he staid not to inquire above them all the golden sun in splendour likest heaven allured his eye thither his course he bends through the calm firmament but up or down by center or eccentrick hard to tell or longitude where the great luminary aloof the vulgar constellations thick that from his lordly eye keep distance due dispenses light from far they as they move their starry dance in numbers that compute days months and years towards his all-cheering lamp turn swift their various motions or are turned by his magnetick beam that gently warms the universe and to each inward part with gentle penetration though unseen shoots invisible virtue even to the deep so wonderously was set his station bright there lands the fiend a spot like which perhaps astronomer in the sun's lucent orb through his glazed optick tube yet never saw the place he found beyond expression bright compared with aught on earth metal or stone not all parts like but all alike informed with radiant light as glowing iron with fire if metal part seemed gold part silver clear if stone carbuncle most or chrysolite ruby or topaz to the twelve that shone in aaron's breast-plate and a stone besides imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen that stone or like to that which here below philosophers in vain so long have sought in vain though by their powerful art they bind volatile hermes and call up unbound in various shapes old proteus from the sea drained through a limbeck to his native form what wonder then if fields and regions here breathe forth elixir pure and rivers run potable gold when with one virtuous touch the arch-chemick sun so far from us remote produces with terrestrial humour mixed here in the dark so many precious things of colour glorious and effect so rare here matter new to gaze the devil met undazzled far and wide his eye commands for sight no obstacle found here nor shade but all sun-shine as when his beams at noon culminate from the equator as they now shot upward still direct whence no way round shadow from body opaque can fall and the air no where so clear sharpened his visual ray to objects distant far whereby he soon saw within ken a glorious angel stand the same whom john saw also in the sun his back was turned but not his brightness hid of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar circled his head nor less his locks behind illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings lay waving round on some great charge employed he seemed or fixed in cogitation deep glad was the spirit impure as now in hope to find who might direct his wandering flight to paradise the happy seat of man his journey's end and our beginning woe but first he casts to change his proper shape which else might work him danger or delay and now a stripling cherub he appears not of the prime yet such as in his face youth smiled celestial and to every limb suitable grace diffused so well he feigned under a coronet his flowing hair in curls on either cheek played wings he wore of many a coloured plume sprinkled with gold his habit fit for speed succinct and held before his decent steps a silver wand he drew not nigh unheard the angel bright ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turned admonished by his ear and straight was known the arch-angel uriel one of the seven who in god's presence nearest to his throne stand ready at command and are his eyes that run through all the heavens or down to the earth bear his swift errands over moist and dry o'er sea and land him satan thus accosts uriel for thou of those seven spirits that stand in sight of god's high throne gloriously bright the first art wont his great authentick will interpreter through highest heaven to bring where all his sons thy embassy attend and here art likeliest by supreme decree like honour to obtain and as his eye to visit oft this new creation round unspeakable desire to see and know all these his wonderous works but chiefly man his chief delight and favour him for whom all these his works so wonderous he ordained hath brought me from the quires of cherubim alone thus wandering brightest seraph tell in which of all these shining orbs hath man his fixed seat or fixed seat hath none but all these shining orbs his choice to dwell that i may find him and with secret gaze or open admiration him behold on whom the great creator hath bestowed worlds and on whom hath all these graces poured that both in him and all things as is meet the universal maker we may praise who justly hath driven out his rebel foes to deepest hell and to repair that loss created this new happy race of men to serve him better wise are all his ways so spake the false dissembler unperceived for neither man nor angel can discern hypocrisy the only evil that walks invisible except to god alone by his permissive will through heaven and earth and oft though wisdom wake suspicion sleeps at wisdom's gate and to simplicity resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill where no ill seems which now for once beguiled uriel though regent of the sun and held the sharpest-sighted spirit of all in heaven who to the fraudulent impostor foul in his uprightness answer thus returned fair angel thy desire which tends to know the works of god thereby to glorify the great work-master leads to no excess that reaches blame but rather merits praise the more it seems excess that led thee hither from thy empyreal mansion thus alone to witness with thine eyes what some perhaps contented with report hear only in heaven for wonderful indeed are all his works pleasant to know and worthiest to be all had in remembrance always with delight but what created mind can comprehend their number or the wisdom infinite that brought them forth but hid their causes deep i saw when at his word the formless mass this world's material mould came to a heap confusion heard his voice and wild uproar stood ruled stood vast infinitude confined till at his second bidding darkness fled light shone and order from disorder sprung swift to their several quarters hasted then the cumbrous elements earth flood air fire and this ethereal quintessence of heaven flew upward spirited with various forms that rolled orbicular and turned to stars numberless as thou seest and how they move each had his place appointed each his course the rest in circuit walls this universe look downward on that globe whose hither side with light from hence though but reflected shines that place is earth the seat of man that light his day which else as the other hemisphere night would invade but there the neighbouring moon so call that opposite fair star her aid timely interposes and her monthly round still ending still renewing through mid heaven with borrowed light her countenance triform hence fills and empties to enlighten the earth and in her pale dominion checks the night that spot to which i point is paradise adam's abode those lofty shades his bower thy way thou canst not miss me mine requires thus said he turned and satan bowing low as to superiour spirits is wont in heaven where honour due and reverence none neglects took leave and toward the coast of earth beneath down from the ecliptick sped with hoped success throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel nor staid till on niphates' top he lights book iv o for that warning voice which he who saw the apocalypse heard cry in heaven aloud then when the dragon put to second rout came furious down to be revenged on men woe to the inhabitants on earth that now while time was our first parents had been warned the coming of their secret foe and 'scaped haply so 'scaped his mortal snare for now satan now first inflamed with rage came down the tempter ere the accuser of mankind to wreak on innocent frail man his loss of that first battle and his flight to hell yet not rejoicing in his speed though bold far off and fearless nor with cause to boast begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast and like a devilish engine back recoils upon himself horrour and doubt distract his troubled thoughts and from the bottom stir the hell within him for within him hell he brings and round about him nor from hell one step no more than from himself can fly by change of place now conscience wakes despair that slumbered wakes the bitter memory of what he was what is and what must be worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue sometimes towards eden which now in his view lay pleasant his grieved look he fixes sad sometimes towards heaven and the full-blazing sun which now sat high in his meridian tower then much revolving thus in sighs began o thou that with surpassing glory crowned lookest from thy sole dominion like the god of this new world at whose sight all the stars hide their diminished heads to thee i call but with no friendly voice and add thy name of sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams that bring to my remembrance from what state i fell how glorious once above thy sphere till pride and worse ambition threw me down warring in heaven against heaven's matchless king ah wherefore he deserved no such return from me whom he created what i was in that bright eminence and with his good upbraided none nor was his service hard what could be less than to afford him praise the easiest recompence and pay him thanks how due yet all his good proved ill in me and wrought but malice lifted up so high i sdeined subjection and thought one step higher would set me highest and in a moment quit the debt immense of endless gratitude so burdensome still paying still to owe forgetful what from him i still received and understood not that a grateful mind by owing owes not but still pays at once indebted and discharged what burden then o had his powerful destiny ordained me some inferiour angel i had stood then happy no unbounded hope had raised ambition yet why not some other power as great might have aspired and me though mean drawn to his part but other powers as great fell not but stand unshaken from within or from without to all temptations armed hadst thou the same free will and power to stand thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse but heaven's free love dealt equally to all be then his love accursed since love or hate to me alike it deals eternal woe nay cursed be thou since against his thy will chose freely what it now so justly rues me miserable which way shall i fly infinite wrath and infinite despair which way i fly is hell myself am hell and in the lowest deep a lower deep still threatening to devour me opens wide to which the hell i suffer seems a heaven o then at last relent is there no place left for repentance none for pardon left none left but by submission and that word disdain forbids me and my dread of shame among the spirits beneath whom i seduced with other promises and other vaunts than to submit boasting i could subdue the omnipotent ay me they little know how dearly i abide that boast so vain under what torments inwardly i groan while they adore me on the throne of hell with diadem and scepter high advanced the lower still i fall only supreme in misery such joy ambition finds but say i could repent and could obtain by act of grace my former state how soon would highth recall high thoughts how soon unsay what feigned submission swore ease would recant vows made in pain as violent and void for never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep which would but lead me to a worse relapse and heavier fall so should i purchase dear short intermission bought with double smart this knows my punisher therefore as far from granting he as i from begging peace all hope excluded thus behold in stead mankind created and for him this world so farewell hope and with hope farewell fear farewell remorse all good to me is lost evil be thou my good by thee at least divided empire with heaven's king i hold by thee and more than half perhaps will reign as man ere long and this new world shall know thus while he spake each passion dimmed his face thrice changed with pale ire envy and despair which marred his borrowed visage and betrayed him counterfeit if any eye beheld for heavenly minds from such distempers foul are ever clear whereof he soon aware each perturbation smoothed with outward calm artificer of fraud and was the first that practised falsehood under saintly show deep malice to conceal couched with revenge yet not enough had practised to deceive uriel once warned whose eye pursued him down the way he went and on the assyrian mount saw him disfigured more than could befall spirit of happy sort his gestures fierce he marked and mad demeanour then alone as he supposed all unobserved unseen so on he fares and to the border comes of eden where delicious paradise now nearer crowns with her enclosure green as with a rural mound the champaign head of a steep wilderness whose hairy sides access denied and overhead upgrew insuperable height of loftiest shade cedar and pine and fir and branching palm a sylvan scene and as the ranks ascend shade above shade a woody theatre of stateliest view yet higher than their tops the verdurous wall of paradise upsprung 00081429 which to our general sire gave prospect large into his nether empire neighbouring round and higher than that wall a circling row of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue appeared with gay enamelled colours mixed on which the sun more glad impressed his beams than in fair evening cloud or humid bow when god hath showered the earth so lovely seemed that landskip and of pure now purer air meets his approach and to the heart inspires vernal delight and joy able to drive all sadness but despair now gentle gales fanning their odoriferous wings dispense native perfumes and whisper whence they stole those balmy spoils as when to them who fail beyond the cape of hope and now are past mozambick off at sea north-east winds blow sabean odours from the spicy shore of araby the blest with such delay well pleased they slack their course and many a league cheered with the grateful smell old ocean smiles so entertained those odorous sweets the fiend who came their bane though with them better pleased than asmodeus with the fishy fume that drove him though enamoured from the spouse of tobit's son and with a vengeance sent from media post to egypt there fast bound now to the ascent of that steep savage hill satan had journeyed on pensive and slow but further way found none so thick entwined as one continued brake the undergrowth of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed all path of man or beast that passed that way one gate there only was and that looked east on the other side which when the arch-felon saw due entrance he disdained and in contempt at one flight bound high over-leaped all bound of hill or highest wall and sheer within lights on his feet as when a prowling wolf whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve in hurdled cotes amid the field secure leaps o'er the fence with ease into the fold or as a thief bent to unhoard the cash of some rich burgher whose substantial doors cross-barred and bolted fast fear no assault in at the window climbs or o'er the tiles so clomb this first grand thief into god's fold so since into his church lewd hirelings climb thence up he flew and on the tree of life the middle tree and highest there that grew sat like a cormorant yet not true life thereby regained but sat devising death to them who lived nor on the virtue thought of that life-giving plant but only used for prospect what well used had been the pledge of immortality so little knows any but god alone to value right the good before him but perverts best things to worst abuse or to their meanest use beneath him with new wonder now he views to all delight of human sense exposed in narrow room nature's whole wealth yea more a heaven on earth for blissful paradise of god the garden was by him in the east of eden planted eden stretched her line from auran eastward to the royal towers of great seleucia built by grecian kings of where the sons of eden long before dwelt in telassar in this pleasant soil his far more pleasant garden god ordained out of the fertile ground he caused to grow all trees of noblest kind for sight smell taste and all amid them stood the tree of life high eminent blooming ambrosial fruit of vegetable gold and next to life our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill southward through eden went a river large nor changed his course but through the shaggy hill passed underneath ingulfed for god had thrown that mountain as his garden-mould high raised upon the rapid current which through veins of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill watered the garden thence united fell down the steep glade and met the nether flood which from his darksome passage now appears and now divided into four main streams runs diverse wandering many a famous realm and country whereof here needs no account but rather to tell how if art could tell how from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold with mazy errour under pendant shades ran nectar visiting each plant and fed flowers worthy of paradise which not nice art in beds and curious knots but nature boon poured forth profuse on hill and dale and plain both where the morning sun first warmly smote the open field and where the unpierced shade imbrowned the noontide bowers thus was this place a happy rural seat of various view groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm others whose fruit burnished with golden rind hung amiable hesperian fables true if true here only and of delicious taste betwixt them lawns or level downs and flocks grazing the tender herb were interposed or palmy hillock or the flowery lap of some irriguous valley spread her store flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose another side umbrageous grots and caves of cool recess o'er which the mantling vine lays forth her purple grape and gently creeps luxuriant mean while murmuring waters fall down the slope hills dispersed or in a lake that to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned her crystal mirrour holds unite their streams the birds their quire apply airs vernal airs breathing the smell of field and grove attune the trembling leaves while universal pan knit with the graces and the hours in dance led on the eternal spring not that fair field of enna where proserpine gathering flowers herself a fairer flower by gloomy dis was gathered which cost ceres all that pain to seek her through the world nor that sweet grove of daphne by orontes and the inspired castalian spring might with this paradise of eden strive nor that nyseian isle girt with the river triton where old cham whom gentiles ammon call and libyan jove hid amalthea and her florid son young bacchus from his stepdame rhea's eye nor where abassin kings their issue guard mount amara though this by some supposed true paradise under the ethiop line by nilus' head enclosed with shining rock a whole day's journey high but wide remote from this assyrian garden where the fiend saw undelighted all delight all kind of living creatures new to sight and strange two of far nobler shape erect and tall godlike erect with native honour clad in naked majesty seemed lords of all and worthy seemed for in their looks divine the image of their glorious maker shone truth wisdom sanctitude severe and pure severe but in true filial freedom placed whence true authority in men though both not equal as their sex not equal seemed for contemplation he and valour formed for softness she and sweet attractive grace he for god only she for god in him his fair large front and eye sublime declared absolute rule and hyacinthine locks round from his parted forelock manly hung clustering but not beneath his shoulders broad she as a veil down to the slender waist her unadorned golden tresses wore dishevelled but in wanton ringlets waved as the vine curls her tendrils which implied subjection but required with gentle sway and by her yielded by him best received yielded with coy submission modest pride and sweet reluctant amorous delay nor those mysterious parts were then concealed then was not guilty shame dishonest shame of nature's works honour dishonourable sin-bred how have ye troubled all mankind with shows instead mere shows of seeming pure and banished from man's life his happiest life simplicity and spotless innocence so passed they naked on nor shunned the sight of god or angel for they thought no ill so hand in hand they passed the loveliest pair that ever since in love's embraces met adam the goodliest man of men since born his sons the fairest of her daughters eve under a tuft of shade that on a green stood whispering soft by a fresh fountain side they sat them down and after no more toil of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed to recommend cool zephyr and made ease more easy wholesome thirst and appetite more grateful to their supper-fruits they fell nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs yielded them side-long as they sat recline on the soft downy bank damasked with flowers the savoury pulp they chew and in the rind still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream nor gentle purpose nor endearing smiles wanted nor youthful dalliance as beseems fair couple linked in happy nuptial league alone as they about them frisking played all beasts of the earth since wild and of all chase in wood or wilderness forest or den sporting the lion ramped and in his paw dandled the kid bears tigers ounces pards gambolled before them the unwieldy elephant to make them mirth used all his might and wreathed his kithetmroboscis close the serpent sly insinuating wove with gordian twine his braided train and of his fatal guile gave proof unheeded others on the grass couched and now filled with pasture gazing sat or bedward ruminating for the sun declined was hasting now with prone career to the ocean isles and in the ascending scale of heaven the stars that usher evening rose when satan still in gaze as first he stood scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad o hell what do mine eyes with grief behold into our room of bliss thus high advanced creatures of other mould earth-born perhaps not spirits yet to heavenly spirits bright little inferiour whom my thoughts pursue with wonder and could love so lively shines in them divine resemblance and such grace the hand that formed them on their shape hath poured ah gentle pair ye little think how nigh your change approaches when all these delights will vanish and deliver ye to woe more woe the more your taste is now of joy happy but for so happy ill secured long to continue and this high seat your heaven ill fenced for heaven to keep out such a foe as now is entered yet no purposed foe to you whom i could pity thus forlorn though i unpitied league with you i seek and mutual amity so strait so close that i with you must dwell or you with me henceforth my dwelling haply may not please like this fair paradise your sense yet such accept your maker's work he gave it me which i as freely give hell shall unfold to entertain you two her widest gates and send forth all her kings there will be room not like these narrow limits to receive your numerous offspring if no better place thank him who puts me loth to this revenge on you who wrong me not for him who wronged and should i at your harmless innocence melt as i do yet publick reason just honour and empire with revenge enlarged by conquering this new world compels me now to do what else though damned i should abhor so spake the fiend and with necessity the tyrant's plea excused his devilish deeds then from his lofty stand on that high tree down he alights among the sportful herd of those four-footed kinds himself now one now other as their shape served best his end nearer to view his prey and unespied to mark what of their state he more might learn by word or action marked about them round a lion now he stalks with fiery glare then as a tiger who by chance hath spied in some purlieu two gentle fawns at play straight couches close then rising changes oft his couchant watch as one who chose his ground whence rushing he might surest seize them both griped in each paw when adam first of men to first of women eve thus moving speech turned him all ear to hear new utterance flow sole partner and sole part of all these joys dearer thyself than all needs must the power that made us and for us this ample world be infinitely good and of his good as liberal and free as infinite that raised us from the dust and placed us here in all this happiness who at his hand have nothing merited nor can perform aught whereof he hath need he who requires from us no other service than to keep this one this easy charge of all the trees in paradise that bear delicious fruit so various not to taste that only tree of knowledge planted by the tree of life so near grows death to life whate'er death is some dreadful thing no doubt for well thou knowest god hath pronounced it death to taste that tree the only sign of our obedience left among so many signs of power and rule conferred upon us and dominion given over all other creatures that possess earth air and sea then let us not think hard one easy prohibition who enjoy free leave so large to all things else and choice unlimited of manifold delights but let us ever praise him and extol his bounty following our delightful task to prune these growing plants and tend these flowers which were it toilsome yet with thee were sweet to whom thus eve replied o thou for whom and from whom i was formed flesh of thy flesh and without whom am to no end my guide and head what thou hast said is just and right for we to him indeed all praises owe and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy so far the happier lot enjoying thee pre-eminent by so much odds while thou like consort to thyself canst no where find that day i oft remember when from sleep i first awaked and found myself reposed under a shade on flowers much wondering where and what i was whence thither brought and how not distant far from thence a murmuring sound of waters issued from a cave and spread into a liquid plain then stood unmoved pure as the expanse of heaven i thither went with unexperienced thought and laid me down on the green bank to look into the clear smooth lake that to me seemed another sky as i bent down to look just opposite a shape within the watery gleam appeared bending to look on me i started back it started back but pleased i soon returned pleased it returned as soon with answering looks of sympathy and love there i had fixed mine eyes till now and pined with vain desire had not a voice thus warned me 'what thou seest 'what there thou seest fair creature is thyself 'with thee it came and goes but follow me 'and i will bring thee where no shadow stays 'thy coming and thy soft embraces he 'whose image thou art him thou shalt enjoy 'inseparably thine to him shalt bear 'multitudes like thyself and thence be called 'mother of human race ' what could i do but follow straight invisibly thus led till i espied thee fair indeed and tall under a platane yet methought less fair less winning soft less amiably mild than that smooth watery image back i turned thou following cryedst aloud 'return fair eve 'whom flyest thou whom thou flyest of him thou art 'his flesh his bone to give thee being i lent 'out of my side to thee nearest my heart 'substantial life to have thee by my side 'henceforth an individual solace dear 'part of my soul i seek thee and thee claim 'my other half ' with that thy gentle hand seised mine i yielded and from that time see how beauty is excelled by manly grace and wisdom which alone is truly fair so spake our general mother and with eyes of conjugal attraction unreproved and meek surrender half-embracing leaned on our first father half her swelling breast naked met his under the flowing gold of her loose tresses hid he in delight both of her beauty and submissive charms smiled with superiour love as jupiter on juno smiles when he impregns the clouds that shed mayflowers and pressed her matron lip with kisses pure aside the devil turned for envy yet with jealous leer malign eyed them askance and to himself thus plained sight hateful sight tormenting thus these two imparadised in one another's arms the happier eden shall enjoy their fill of bliss on bliss while i to hell am thrust where neither joy nor love but fierce desire among our other torments not the least still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines yet let me not forget what i have gained from their own mouths all is not theirs it seems one fatal tree there stands of knowledge called forbidden them to taste knowledge forbidden suspicious reasonless why should their lord envy them that can it be sin to know can it be death and do they only stand by ignorance is that their happy state the proof of their obedience and their faith o fair foundation laid whereon to build their ruin hence i will excite their minds with more desire to know and to reject envious commands invented with design to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt equal with gods aspiring to be such they taste and die what likelier can ensue but first with narrow search i must walk round this garden and no corner leave unspied a chance but chance may lead where i may meet some wandering spirit of heaven by fountain side or in thick shade retired from him to draw what further would be learned live while ye may yet happy pair enjoy till i return short pleasures for long woes are to succeed so saying his proud step he scornful turned but with sly circumspection and began through wood through waste o'er hill o'er dale his roam mean while in utmost longitude where heaven with earth and ocean meets the setting sun slowly descended and with right aspect against the eastern gate of paradise levelled his evening rays it was a rock of alabaster piled up to the clouds conspicuous far winding with one ascent accessible from earth one entrance high the rest was craggy cliff that overhung still as it rose impossible to climb betwixt these rocky pillars gabriel sat chief of the angelick guards awaiting night about him exercised heroick games the unarmed youth of heaven but nigh at hand celestial armoury shields helms and spears hung high with diamond flaming and with gold thither came uriel gliding through the even on a sun-beam swift as a shooting star in autumn thwarts the night when vapours fired impress the air and shows the mariner from what point of his compass to beware impetuous winds he thus began in haste gabriel to thee thy course by lot hath given charge and strict watch that to this happy place no evil thing approach or enter in this day at highth of noon came to my sphere a spirit zealous as he seemed to know more of the almighty's works and chiefly man god's latest image i described his way bent all on speed and marked his aery gait but in the mount that lies from eden north where he first lighted soon discerned his looks alien from heaven with passions foul obscured mine eye pursued him still but under shade lost sight of him one of the banished crew i fear hath ventured from the deep to raise new troubles him thy care must be to find to whom the winged warriour thus returned uriel no wonder if thy perfect sight amid the sun's bright circle where thou sitst see far and wide in at this gate none pass the vigilance here placed but such as come well known from heaven and since meridian hour no creature thence if spirit of other sort so minded have o'er-leaped these earthly bounds on purpose hard thou knowest it to exclude spiritual substance with corporeal bar but if within the circuit of these walks in whatsoever shape he lurk of whom thou tellest by morrow dawning i shall know so promised he and uriel to his charge returned on that bright beam whose point now raised bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen beneath the azores whether the prime orb incredible how swift had thither rolled diurnal or this less volubil earth by shorter flight to the east had left him there arraying with reflected purple and gold the clouds that on his western throne attend now came still evening on and twilight gray had in her sober livery all things clad silence accompanied for beast and bird they to their grassy couch these to their nests were slunk all but the wakeful nightingale she all night long her amorous descant sung silence was pleased now glowed the firmament with living sapphires hesperus that led the starry host rode brightest till the moon rising in clouded majesty at length apparent queen unveiled her peerless light and o'er the dark her silver mantle threw when adam thus to eve fair consort the hour of night and all things now retired to rest mind us of like repose since god hath set labour and rest as day and night to men successive and the timely dew of sleep now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines our eye-lids other creatures all day long rove idle unemployed and less need rest man hath his daily work of body or mind appointed which declares his dignity and the regard of heaven on all his ways while other animals unactive range and of their doings god takes no account to-morrow ere fresh morning streak the east with first approach of light we must be risen and at our pleasant labour to reform yon flowery arbours yonder alleys green our walk at noon with branches overgrown that mock our scant manuring and require more hands than ours to lop their wanton growth those blossoms also and those dropping gums that lie bestrown unsightly and unsmooth ask riddance if we mean to tread with ease mean while as nature wills night bids us rest to whom thus eve with perfect beauty adorned my author and disposer what thou bidst unargued i obey so god ordains god is thy law thou mine to know no more is woman's happiest knowledge and her praise with thee conversing i forget all time all seasons and their change all please alike sweet is the breath of morn her rising sweet with charm of earliest birds pleasant the sun when first on this delightful land he spreads his orient beams on herb tree fruit and flower glistering with dew fragrant the fertile earth after soft showers and sweet the coming on of grateful evening mild then silent night with this her solemn bird and this fair moon and these the gems of heaven her starry train but neither breath of morn when she ascends with charm of earliest birds nor rising sun on this delightful land nor herb fruit flower glistering with dew nor fragrance after showers nor grateful evening mild nor silent night with this her solemn bird nor walk by moon or glittering star-light without thee is sweet but wherefore all night long shine these for whom this glorious sight when sleep hath shut all eyes to whom our general ancestor replied daughter of god and man accomplished eve these have their course to finish round the earth by morrow evening and from land to land in order though to nations yet unborn ministring light prepared they set and rise lest total darkness should by night regain her old possession and extinguish life in nature and all things which these soft fires not only enlighten but with kindly heat of various influence foment and warm temper or nourish or in part shed down their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow on earth made hereby apter to receive perfection from the sun's more potent ray these then though unbeheld in deep of night shine not in vain nor think though men were none that heaven would want spectators god want praise millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth unseen both when we wake and when we sleep all these with ceaseless praise his works behold both day and night how often from the steep of echoing hill or thicket have we heard celestial voices to the midnight air sole or responsive each to others note singing their great creator oft in bands while they keep watch or nightly rounding walk with heavenly touch of instrumental sounds in full harmonick number joined their songs divide the night and lift our thoughts to heaven thus talking hand in hand alone they passed on to their blissful bower it was a place chosen by the sovran planter when he framed all things to man's delightful use the roof of thickest covert was inwoven shade laurel and myrtle and what higher grew of firm and fragrant leaf on either side acanthus and each odorous bushy shrub fenced up the verdant wall each beauteous flower iris all hues roses and jessamin reared high their flourished heads between and wrought mosaick underfoot the violet crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay broidered the ground more coloured than with stone of costliest emblem other creature here bird beast insect or worm durst enter none such was their awe of man in shadier bower more sacred and sequestered though but feigned pan or sylvanus never slept nor nymph nor faunus haunted here in close recess with flowers garlands and sweet-smelling herbs espoused eve decked first her nuptial bed and heavenly quires the hymenaean sung what day the genial angel to our sire brought her in naked beauty more adorned more lovely than pandora whom the gods endowed with all their gifts and o too like in sad event when to the unwiser son of japhet brought by hermes she ensnared mankind with her fair looks to be avenged on him who had stole jove's authentick fire thus at their shady lodge arrived both stood both turned and under open sky adored the god that made both sky air earth and heaven which they beheld the moon's resplendent globe and starry pole thou also madest the night maker omnipotent and thou the day which we in our appointed work employed have finished happy in our mutual help and mutual love the crown of all our bliss ordained by thee and this delicious place for us too large where thy abundance wants partakers and uncropt falls to the ground but thou hast promised from us two a race to fill the earth who shall with us extol thy goodness infinite both when we wake and when we seek as now thy gift of sleep this said unanimous and other rites observing none but adoration pure which god likes best into their inmost bower handed they went and eased the putting off these troublesome disguises which we wear straight side by side were laid nor turned i ween adam from his fair spouse nor eve the rites mysterious of connubial love refused whatever hypocrites austerely talk of purity and place and innocence defaming as impure what god declares pure and commands to some leaves free to all our maker bids encrease who bids abstain but our destroyer foe to god and man hail wedded love mysterious law true source of human offspring sole propriety in paradise of all things common else by thee adulterous lust was driven from men among the bestial herds to range by thee founded in reason loyal just and pure relations dear and all the charities of father son and brother first were known far be it that i should write thee sin or blame or think thee unbefitting holiest place perpetual fountain of domestick sweets whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced present or past as saints and patriarchs used here love his golden shafts employs here lights his constant lamp and waves his purple wings reigns here and revels not in the bought smile of harlots loveless joyless unendeared casual fruition nor in court-amours mixed dance or wanton mask or midnight ball or serenate which the starved lover sings to his proud fair best quitted with disdain these lulled by nightingales embracing slept and on their naked limbs the flowery roof showered roses which the morn repaired sleep on blest pair and o yet happiest if ye seek no happier state and know to know no more now had night measured with her shadowy cone half way up hill this vast sublunar vault and from their ivory port the cherubim forth issuing at the accustomed hour stood armed to their night watches in warlike parade when gabriel to his next in power thus spake uzziel half these draw off and coast the south with strictest watch these other wheel the north our circuit meets full west as flame they part half wheeling to the shield half to the spear from these two strong and subtle spirits he called that near him stood and gave them thus in charge ithuriel and zephon with winged speed search through this garden leave unsearched no nook but chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge now laid perhaps asleep secure of harm this evening from the sun's decline arrived who tells of some infernal spirit seen hitherward bent who could have thought escaped the bars of hell on errand bad no doubt such where ye find seise fast and hither bring so saying on he led his radiant files dazzling the moon these to the bower direct in search of whom they sought him there they found squat like a toad close at the ear of eve assaying by his devilish art to reach the organs of her fancy and with them forge illusions as he list phantasms and dreams or if inspiring venom he might taint the animal spirits that from pure blood arise like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise at least distempered discontented thoughts vain hopes vain aims inordinate desires blown up with high conceits ingendering pride him thus intent ithuriel with his spear touched lightly for no falshood can endure touch of celestial temper but returns of force to its own likeness up he starts discovered and surprised as when a spark lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid fit for the tun some magazine to store against a rumoured war the smutty grain with sudden blaze diffused inflames the air so started up in his own shape the fiend back stept those two fair angels half amazed so sudden to behold the grisly king yet thus unmoved with fear accost him soon which of those rebel spirits adjudged to hell comest thou escaped thy prison and transformed why sat'st thou like an enemy in wait here watching at the head of these that sleep know ye not then said satan filled with scorn know ye not me ye knew me once no mate for you there sitting where ye durst not soar not to know me argues yourselves unknown the lowest of your throng or if ye know why ask ye and superfluous begin your message like to end as much in vain to whom thus zephon answering scorn with scorn think not revolted spirit thy shape the same or undiminished brightness to be known as when thou stoodest in heaven upright and pure that glory then when thou no more wast good departed from thee and thou resemblest now thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul but come for thou be sure shalt give account to him who sent us whose charge is to keep this place inviolable and these from harm so spake the cherub and his grave rebuke severe in youthful beauty added grace invincible abashed the devil stood and felt how awful goodness is and saw virtue in her shape how lovely saw and pined his loss but chiefly to find here observed his lustre visibly impaired yet seemed undaunted if i must contend said he best with the best the sender not the sent or all at once more glory will be won or less be lost thy fear said zephon bold will save us trial what the least can do single against thee wicked and thence weak the fiend replied not overcome with rage but like a proud steed reined went haughty on champing his iron curb to strive or fly he held it vain awe from above had quelled his heart not else dismayed now drew they nigh the western point where those half-rounding guards just met and closing stood in squadron joined a waiting next command to whom their chief gabriel from the front thus called aloud o friends i hear the tread of nimble feet hasting this way and now by glimpse discern ithuriel and zephon through the shade and with them comes a third of regal port but faded splendour wan who by his gait and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell not likely to part hence without contest stand firm for in his look defiance lours he scarce had ended when those two approached and brief related whom they brought where found how busied in what form and posture couched to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake why hast thou satan broke the bounds prescribed to thy transgressions and disturbed the charge of others who approve not to transgress by thy example but have power and right to question thy bold entrance on this place employed it seems to violate sleep and those whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss to whom thus satan with contemptuous brow gabriel thou hadst in heaven the esteem of wise and such i held thee but this question asked puts me in doubt lives there who loves his pain who would not finding way break loose from hell though thither doomed thou wouldst thyself no doubt and boldly venture to whatever place farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change torment with ease and soonest recompense dole with delight which in this place i sought to thee no reason who knowest only good but evil hast not tried and wilt object his will who bounds us let him surer bar his iron gates if he intends our stay in that dark durance thus much what was asked the rest is true they found me where they say but that implies not violence or harm thus he in scorn the warlike angel moved disdainfully half smiling thus replied o loss of one in heaven to judge of wise since satan fell whom folly overthrew and now returns him from his prison 'scaped gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise or not who ask what boldness brought him hither unlicensed from his bounds in hell prescribed so wise he judges it to fly from pain however and to 'scape his punishment so judge thou still presumptuous till the wrath which thou incurrest by flying meet thy flight sevenfold and scourge that wisdom back to hell which taught thee yet no better that no pain can equal anger infinite provoked but wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee came not all hell broke loose or thou than they less hardy to endure courageous chief the first in flight from pain hadst thou alleged to thy deserted host this cause of flight thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive to which the fiend thus answered frowning stern not that i less endure or shrink from pain insulting angel well thou knowest i stood thy fiercest when in battle to thy aid the blasting vollied thunder made all speed and seconded thy else not dreaded spear but still thy words at random as before argue thy inexperience what behoves from hard assays and ill successes past a faithful leader not to hazard all through ways of danger by himself untried i therefore i alone first undertook to wing the desolate abyss and spy this new created world whereof in hell fame is not silent here in hope to find better abode and my afflicted powers to settle here on earth or in mid air though for possession put to try once more what thou and thy gay legions dare against whose easier business were to serve their lord high up in heaven with songs to hymn his throne and practised distances to cringe not fight to whom the warriour angel soon replied to say and straight unsay pretending first wise to fly pain professing next the spy argues no leader but a liear traced satan and couldst thou faithful add o name o sacred name of faithfulness profaned faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew army of fiends fit body to fit head was this your discipline and faith engaged your military obedience to dissolve allegiance to the acknowledged power supreme and thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem patron of liberty who more than thou once fawned and cringed and servily adored heaven's awful monarch wherefore but in hope to dispossess him and thyself to reign but mark what i arreed thee now avant fly neither whence thou fledst if from this hour within these hallowed limits thou appear back to the infernal pit i drag thee chained and seal thee so as henceforth not to scorn the facile gates of hell too slightly barred so threatened he but satan to no threats gave heed but waxing more in rage replied then when i am thy captive talk of chains proud limitary cherub but ere then far heavier load thyself expect to feel from my prevailing arm though heaven's king ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers us'd to the yoke drawest his triumphant wheels in progress through the road of heaven star-paved while thus he spake the angelick squadron bright turned fiery red sharpening in mooned horns their phalanx and began to hem him round with ported spears as thick as when a field of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends her bearded grove of ears which way the wind sways them the careful plowman doubting stands left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves prove chaff on the other side satan alarmed collecting all his might dilated stood like teneriff or atlas unremoved his stature reached the sky and on his crest sat horrour plumed nor wanted in his grasp what seemed both spear and shield now dreadful deeds might have ensued nor only paradise in this commotion but the starry cope of heaven perhaps or all the elements at least had gone to wrack disturbed and torn with violence of this conflict had not soon the eternal to prevent such horrid fray hung forth in heaven his golden scales yet seen betwixt astrea and the scorpion sign wherein all things created first he weighed the pendulous round earth with balanced air in counterpoise now ponders all events battles and realms in these he put two weights the sequel each of parting and of fight the latter quick up flew and kicked the beam which gabriel spying thus bespake the fiend satan i know thy strength and thou knowest mine neither our own but given what folly then to boast what arms can do since thine no more than heaven permits nor mine though doubled now to trample thee as mire for proof look up and read thy lot in yon celestial sign where thou art weighed and shown how light how weak if thou resist the fiend looked up and knew his mounted scale aloft nor more but fled murmuring and with him fled the shades of night book v now morn her rosy steps in the eastern clime advancing sowed the earth with orient pearl when adam waked so customed for his sleep was aery-light from pure digestion bred and temperate vapours bland which the only sound of leaves and fuming rills aurora's fan lightly dispersed and the shrill matin song of birds on every bough so much the more his wonder was to find unwakened eve with tresses discomposed and glowing cheek as through unquiet rest he on his side leaning half raised with looks of cordial love hung over her enamoured and beheld beauty which whether waking or asleep shot forth peculiar graces then with voice mild as when zephyrus on flora breathes her hand soft touching whispered thus awake my fairest my espoused my latest found heaven's last best gift my ever new delight awake the morning shines and the fresh field calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring our tender plants how blows the citron grove what drops the myrrh and what the balmy reed how nature paints her colours how the bee sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet such whispering waked her but with startled eye on adam whom embracing thus she spake o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose my glory my perfection glad i see thy face and morn returned for i this night such night till this i never passed have dreamed if dreamed not as i oft am wont of thee works of day past or morrow's next design but of offence and trouble which my mind knew never till this irksome night methought close at mine ear one called me forth to walk with gentle voice i thought it thine it said 'why sleepest thou eve now is the pleasant time 'the cool the silent save where silence yields 'to the night-warbling bird that now awake 'tunes sweetest his love-laboured song now reigns 'full-orbed the moon and with more pleasing light 'shadowy sets off the face of things in vain 'if none regard heaven wakes with all his eyes 'whom to behold but thee nature's desire 'in whose sight all things joy with ravishment 'attracted by thy beauty still to gaze ' i rose as at thy call but found thee not to find thee i directed then my walk and on methought alone i passed through ways that brought me on a sudden to the tree of interdicted knowledge fair it seemed much fairer to my fancy than by day and as i wondering looked beside it stood one shaped and winged like one of those from heaven by us oft seen his dewy locks distilled ambrosia on that tree he also gazed and 'o fair plant ' said he 'with fruit surcharged 'deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet 'nor god nor man is knowledge so despised 'or envy or what reserve forbids to taste 'forbid who will none shall from me withhold 'longer thy offered good why else set here this said he paused not but with venturous arm he plucked he tasted me damp horrour chilled at such bold words vouched with a deed so bold but he thus overjoyed 'o fruit divine 'sweet of thyself but much more sweet thus cropt 'forbidden here it seems as only fit 'for gods yet able to make gods of men 'and why not gods of men since good the more 'communicated more abundant grows 'the author not impaired but honoured more 'here happy creature fair angelick eve 'partake thou also happy though thou art 'happier thou mayest be worthier canst not be 'taste this and be henceforth among the gods 'thyself a goddess not to earth confined 'but sometimes in the air as we sometimes 'ascend to heaven by merit thine and see 'what life the gods live there and such live thou ' so saying he drew nigh and to me held even to my mouth of that same fruit held part which he had plucked the pleasant savoury smell so quickened appetite that i methought could not but taste forthwith up to the clouds with him i flew and underneath beheld the earth outstretched immense a prospect wide and various wondering at my flight and change to this high exaltation suddenly my guide was gone and i methought sunk down and fell asleep but o how glad i waked to find this but a dream thus eve her night related and thus adam answered sad best image of myself and dearer half the trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep affects me equally nor can i like this uncouth dream of evil sprung i fear yet evil whence in thee can harbour none created pure but know that in the soul are many lesser faculties that serve reason as chief among these fancy next her office holds of all external things which the five watchful senses represent she forms imaginations aery shapes which reason joining or disjoining frames all what we affirm or what deny and call our knowledge or opinion then retires into her private cell when nature rests oft in her absence mimick fancy wakes to imitate her but misjoining shapes wild work produces oft and most in dreams ill matching words and deeds long past or late some such resemblances methinks i find of our last evening's talk in this thy dream but with addition strange yet be not sad evil into the mind of god or man may come and go so unreproved and leave no spot or blame behind which gives me hope that what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream waking thou never will consent to do be not disheartened then nor cloud those looks that wont to be more cheerful and serene than when fair morning first smiles on the world and let us to our fresh employments rise among the groves the fountains and the flowers that open now their choisest bosomed smells reserved from night and kept for thee in store so cheered he his fair spouse and she was cheered but silently a gentle tear let fall from either eye and wiped them with her hair two other precious drops that ready stood each in their crystal sluice he ere they fell kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse and pious awe that feared to have offended so all was cleared and to the field they haste but first from under shady arborous roof soon as they forth were come to open sight of day-spring and the sun who scarce up-risen with wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray discovering in wide landskip all the east of paradise and eden's happy plains lowly they bowed adoring and began their orisons each morning duly paid in various style for neither various style nor holy rapture wanted they to praise their maker in fit strains pronounced or sung unmeditated such prompt eloquence flowed from their lips in prose or numerous verse more tuneable than needed lute or harp to add more sweetness and they thus began these are thy glorious works parent of good almighty thine this universal frame thus wonderous fair thyself how wonderous then unspeakable who sitst above these heavens to us invisible or dimly seen in these thy lowest works yet these declare thy goodness beyond thought and power divine speak ye who best can tell ye sons of light angels for ye behold him and with songs and choral symphonies day without night circle his throne rejoicing ye in heaven on earth join all ye creatures to extol him first him last him midst and without end fairest of stars last in the train of night if better thou belong not to the dawn sure pledge of day that crownest the smiling morn with thy bright circlet praise him in thy sphere while day arises that sweet hour of prime thou sun of this great world both eye and soul acknowledge him thy greater sound his praise in thy eternal course both when thou climbest and when high noon hast gained and when thou fallest moon that now meetest the orient sun now flyest with the fixed stars fixed in their orb that flies and ye five other wandering fires that move in mystick dance not without song resound his praise who out of darkness called up light air and ye elements the eldest birth of nature's womb that in quaternion run perpetual circle multiform and mix and nourish all things let your ceaseless change vary to our great maker still new praise ye mists and exhalations that now rise from hill or steaming lake dusky or gray till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold in honour to the world's great author rise whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers rising or falling still advance his praise his praise ye winds that from four quarters blow breathe soft or loud and wave your tops ye pines with every plant in sign of worship wave fountains and ye that warble as ye flow melodious murmurs warbling tune his praise join voices all ye living souls ye birds that singing up to heaven-gate ascend bear on your wings and in your notes his praise ye that in waters glide and ye that walk the earth and stately tread or lowly creep witness if i be silent morn or even to hill or valley fountain or fresh shade made vocal by my song and taught his praise hail universal lord be bounteous still to give us only good and if the night have gathered aught of evil or concealed disperse it as now light dispels the dark so prayed they innocent and to their thoughts firm peace recovered soon and wonted calm on to their morning's rural work they haste among sweet dews and flowers where any row of fruit-trees over-woody reached too far their pampered boughs and needed hands to check fruitless embraces or they led the vine to wed her elm she spoused about him twines her marriageable arms and with him brings her dower the adopted clusters to adorn his barren leaves them thus employed beheld with pity heaven's high king and to him called raphael the sociable spirit that deigned to travel with tobias and secured his marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid raphael said he thou hearest what stir on earth satan from hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf hath raised in paradise and how disturbed this night the human pair how he designs in them at once to ruin all mankind go therefore half this day as friend with friend converse with adam in what bower or shade thou findest him from the heat of noon retired to respite his day-labour with repast or with repose and such discourse bring on as may advise him of his happy state happiness in his power left free to will left to his own free will his will though free yet mutable whence warn him to beware he swerve not too secure tell him withal his danger and from whom what enemy late fallen himself from heaven is plotting now the fall of others from like state of bliss by violence no for that shall be withstood but by deceit and lies this let him know lest wilfully transgressing he pretend surprisal unadmonished unforewarned so spake the eternal father and fulfilled all justice nor delayed the winged saint after his charge received but from among thousand celestial ardours where he stood veiled with his gorgeous wings up springing light flew through the midst of heaven the angelick quires on each hand parting to his speed gave way through all the empyreal road till at the gate of heaven arrived the gate self-opened wide on golden hinges turning as by work divine the sovran architect had framed from hence no cloud or to obstruct his sight star interposed however small he sees not unconformed to other shining globes earth and the garden of god with cedars crowned above all hills as when by night the glass of galileo less assured observes imagined lands and regions in the moon or pilot from amidst the cyclades delos or samos first appearing kens a cloudy spot down thither prone in flight he speeds and through the vast ethereal sky sails between worlds and worlds with steady wing now on the polar winds then with quick fan winnows the buxom air till within soar of towering eagles to all the fowls he seems a phoenix gazed by all as that sole bird when to enshrine his reliques in the sun's bright temple to egyptian thebes he flies at once on the eastern cliff of paradise he lights and to his proper shape returns a seraph winged six wings he wore to shade his lineaments divine the pair that clad each shoulder broad came mantling o'er his breast with regal ornament the middle pair girt like a starry zone his waist and round skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold and colours dipt in heaven the third his feet shadowed from either heel with feathered mail sky-tinctured grain like maia's son he stood and shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance filled the circuit wide straight knew him all the bands of angels under watch and to his state and to his message high in honour rise for on some message high they guessed him bound their glittering tents he passed and now is come into the blissful field through groves of myrrh and flowering odours cassia nard and balm a wilderness of sweets for nature here wantoned as in her prime and played at will her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet wild above rule or art enormous bliss him through the spicy forest onward come adam discerned as in the door he sat of his cool bower while now the mounted sun shot down direct his fervid rays to warm earth's inmost womb more warmth than adam needs and eve within due at her hour prepared for dinner savoury fruits of taste to please true appetite and not disrelish thirst of nectarous draughts between from milky stream berry or grape to whom thus adam called haste hither eve and worth thy sight behold eastward among those trees what glorious shape comes this way moving seems another morn risen on mid-noon some great behest from heaven to us perhaps he brings and will vouchsafe this day to be our guest but go with speed and what thy stores contain bring forth and pour abundance fit to honour and receive our heavenly stranger well we may afford our givers their own gifts and large bestow from large bestowed where nature multiplies her fertile growth and by disburthening grows more fruitful which instructs us not to spare to whom thus eve adam earth's hallowed mould of god inspired small store will serve where store all seasons ripe for use hangs on the stalk save what by frugal storing firmness gains to nourish and superfluous moist consumes but i will haste and from each bough and brake each plant and juciest gourd will pluck such choice to entertain our angel-guest as he beholding shall confess that here on earth god hath dispensed his bounties as in heaven so saying with dispatchful looks in haste she turns on hospitable thoughts intent what choice to choose for delicacy best what order so contrived as not to mix tastes not well joined inelegant but bring taste after taste upheld with kindliest change bestirs her then and from each tender stalk whatever earth all-bearing mother yields in india east or west or middle shore in pontus or the punick coast or where alcinous reigned fruit of all kinds in coat rough or smooth rind or bearded husk or shell she gathers tribute large and on the board heaps with unsparing hand for drink the grape she crushes inoffensive must and meaths from many a berry and from sweet kernels pressed she tempers dulcet creams nor these to hold wants her fit vessels pure then strows the ground with rose and odours from the shrub unfumed mean while our primitive great sire to meet his god-like guest walks forth without more train accompanied than with his own complete perfections in himself was all his state more solemn than the tedious pomp that waits on princes when their rich retinue long of horses led and grooms besmeared with gold dazzles the croud and sets them all agape nearer his presence adam though not awed yet with submiss approach and reverence meek as to a superiour nature bowing low thus said native of heaven for other place none can than heaven such glorious shape contain since by descending from the thrones above those happy places thou hast deigned a while to want and honour these vouchsafe with us two only who yet by sovran gift possess this spacious ground in yonder shady bower to rest and what the garden choicest bears to sit and taste till this meridian heat be over and the sun more cool decline whom thus the angelick virtue answered mild adam i therefore came nor art thou such created or such place hast here to dwell as may not oft invite though spirits of heaven to visit thee lead on then where thy bower o'ershades for these mid-hours till evening rise i have at will so to the sylvan lodge they came that like pomona's arbour smiled with flowerets decked and fragrant smells but eve undecked save with herself more lovely fair than wood-nymph or the fairest goddess feigned of three that in mount ida naked strove stood to entertain her guest from heaven no veil she needed virtue-proof no thought infirm altered her cheek on whom the angel hail bestowed the holy salutation used long after to blest mary second eve hail mother of mankind whose fruitful womb shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons than with these various fruits the trees of god have heaped this table -- raised of grassy turf their table was and mossy seats had round and on her ample square from side to side all autumn piled though spring and autumn here danced hand in hand a while discourse they hold no fear lest dinner cool when thus began our author heavenly stranger please to taste these bounties which our nourisher from whom all perfect good unmeasured out descends to us for food and for delight hath caused the earth to yield unsavoury food perhaps to spiritual natures only this i know that one celestial father gives to all to whom the angel therefore what he gives whose praise be ever sung to man in part spiritual may of purest spirits be found no ingrateful food and food alike those pure intelligential substances require as doth your rational and both contain within them every lower faculty of sense whereby they hear see smell touch taste tasting concoct digest assimilate and corporeal to incorporeal turn for know whatever was created needs to be sustained and fed of elements the grosser feeds the purer earth the sea earth and the sea feed air the air those fires ethereal and as lowest first the moon whence in her visage round those spots unpurged vapours not yet into her substance turned nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale from her moist continent to higher orbs the sun that light imparts to all receives from all his alimental recompence in humid exhalations and at even sups with the ocean though in heaven the trees of life ambrosial fruitage bear and vines yield nectar though from off the boughs each morn we brush mellifluous dews and find the ground covered with pearly grain yet god hath here varied his bounty so with new delights as may compare with heaven and to taste think not i shall be nice so down they sat and to their viands fell nor seemingly the angel nor in mist the common gloss of theologians but with keen dispatch of real hunger and concoctive heat to transubstantiate what redounds transpires through spirits with ease nor wonder if by fire of sooty coal the empirick alchemist can turn or holds it possible to turn metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold as from the mine mean while at table eve ministered naked and their flowing cups with pleasant liquours crowned o innocence deserving paradise if ever then then had the sons of god excuse to have been enamoured at that sight but in those hearts love unlibidinous reigned nor jealousy was understood the injured lover's hell thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed not burdened nature sudden mind arose in adam not to let the occasion pass given him by this great conference to know of things above his world and of their being who dwell in heaven whose excellence he saw transcend his own so far whose radiant forms divine effulgence whose high power so far exceeded human and his wary speech thus to the empyreal minister he framed inhabitant with god now know i well thy favour in this honour done to man under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed to enter and these earthly fruits to taste food not of angels yet accepted so as that more willingly thou couldst not seem at heaven's high feasts to have fed yet what compare to whom the winged hierarch replied o adam one almighty is from whom all things proceed and up to him return if not depraved from good created all such to perfection one first matter all endued with various forms various degrees of substance and in things that live of life but more refined more spiritous and pure as nearer to him placed or nearer tending each in their several active spheres assigned till body up to spirit work in bounds proportioned to each kind so from the root springs lighter the green stalk from thence the leaves more aery last the bright consummate flower spirits odorous breathes flowers and their fruit man's nourishment by gradual scale sublimed to vital spirits aspire to animal to intellectual give both life and sense fancy and understanding whence the soul reason receives and reason is her being discursive or intuitive discourse is oftest yours the latter most is ours differing but in degree of kind the same wonder not then what god for you saw good if i refuse not but convert as you to proper substance time may come when men with angels may participate and find no inconvenient diet nor too light fare and from these corporal nutriments perhaps your bodies may at last turn all to spirit improved by tract of time and winged ascend ethereal as we or may at choice here or in heavenly paradises dwell if ye be found obedient and retain unalterably firm his love entire whose progeny you are mean while enjoy your fill what happiness this happy state can comprehend incapable of more to whom the patriarch of mankind replied o favourable spirit propitious guest well hast thou taught the way that might direct our knowledge and the scale of nature set from center to circumference whereon in contemplation of created things by steps we may ascend to god but say what meant that caution joined if ye be found obedient can we want obedience then to him or possibly his love desert who formed us from the dust and placed us here full to the utmost measure of what bliss human desires can seek or apprehend to whom the angel son of heaven and earth attend that thou art happy owe to god that thou continuest such owe to thyself that is to thy obedience therein stand this was that caution given thee be advised god made thee perfect not immutable and good he made thee but to persevere he left it in thy power ordained thy will by nature free not over-ruled by fate inextricable or strict necessity our voluntary service he requires not our necessitated such with him finds no acceptance nor can find for how can hearts not free be tried whether they serve willing or no who will but what they must by destiny and can no other choose myself and all the angelick host that stand in sight of god enthroned our happy state hold as you yours while our obedience holds on other surety none freely we serve because we freely love as in our will to love or not in this we stand or fall and some are fallen to disobedience fallen and so from heaven to deepest hell o fall from what high state of bliss into what woe to whom our great progenitor thy words attentive and with more delighted ear divine instructer i have heard than when cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills aereal musick send nor knew i not to be both will and deed created free yet that we never shall forget to love our maker and obey him whose command single is yet so just my constant thoughts assured me and still assure though what thou tellest hath passed in heaven some doubt within me move but more desire to hear if thou consent the full relation which must needs be strange worthy of sacred silence to be heard and we have yet large day for scarce the sun hath finished half his journey and scarce begins his other half in the great zone of heaven thus adam made request and raphael after short pause assenting thus began high matter thou enjoinest me o prime of men sad task and hard for how shall i relate to human sense the invisible exploits of warring spirits how without remorse the ruin of so many glorious once and perfect while they stood how last unfold the secrets of another world perhaps not lawful to reveal yet for thy good this is dispensed and what surmounts the reach of human sense i shall delineate so by likening spiritual to corporal forms as may express them best though what if earth be but a shadow of heaven and things therein each to other like more than on earth is thought as yet this world was not and chaos wild reigned where these heavens now roll where earth now rests upon her center poised when on a day for time though in eternity applied to motion measures all things durable by present past and future on such day as heaven's great year brings forth the empyreal host of angels by imperial summons called innumerable before the almighty's throne forthwith from all the ends of heaven appeared under their hierarchs in orders bright ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced standards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear stream in the air and for distinction serve of hierarchies of orders and degrees or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed holy memorials acts of zeal and love recorded eminent thus when in orbs of circuit inexpressible they stood orb within orb the father infinite by whom in bliss imbosomed sat the son amidst as from a flaming mount whose top brightness had made invisible thus spake hear all ye angels progeny of light thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers hear my decree which unrevoked shall stand this day i have begot whom i declare my only son and on this holy hill him have anointed whom ye now behold at my right hand your head i him appoint and by myself have sworn to him shall bow all knees in heaven and shall confess him lord under his great vice-gerent reign abide united as one individual soul for ever happy him who disobeys me disobeys breaks union and that day cast out from god and blessed vision falls into utter darkness deep ingulfed his place ordained without redemption without end so spake the omnipotent and with his words all seemed well pleased all seemed but were not all that day as other solemn days they spent in song and dance about the sacred hill mystical dance which yonder starry sphere of planets and of fixed in all her wheels resembles nearest mazes intricate eccentrick intervolved yet regular then most when most irregular they seem and in their motions harmony divine so smooths her charming tones that god's own ear listens delighted evening now approached for we have also our evening and our morn we ours for change delectable not need forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn desirous all in circles as they stood tables are set and on a sudden piled with angels food and rubied nectar flows in pearl in diamond and massy gold fruit of delicious vines the growth of heaven on flowers reposed and with fresh flowerets crowned they eat they drink and in communion sweet quaff immortality and joy secure of surfeit where full measure only bounds excess before the all-bounteous king who showered with copious hand rejoicing in their joy now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled from that high mount of god whence light and shade spring both the face of brightest heaven had changed to grateful twilight for night comes not there in darker veil and roseat dews disposed all but the unsleeping eyes of god to rest wide over all the plain and wider far than all this globous earth in plain outspread such are the courts of god the angelick throng dispersed in bands and files their camp extend by living streams among the trees of life pavilions numberless and sudden reared celestial tabernacles where they slept fanned with cool winds save those who in their course melodious hymns about the sovran throne alternate all night long but not so waked satan so call him now his former name is heard no more in heaven he of the first if not the first arch-angel great in power in favour and pre-eminence yet fraught with envy against the son of god that day honoured by his great father and proclaimed messiah king anointed could not bear through pride that sight and thought himself impaired deep malice thence conceiving and disdain soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour friendliest to sleep and silence he resolved with all his legions to dislodge and leave unworshipt unobeyed the throne supreme contemptuous and his next subordinate awakening thus to him in secret spake sleepest thou companion dear what sleep can close thy eye-lids and rememberest what decree of yesterday so late hath passed the lips of heaven's almighty thou to me thy thoughts wast wont i mine to thee was wont to impart both waking we were one how then can now thy sleep dissent new laws thou seest imposed new laws from him who reigns new minds may raise in us who serve new counsels to debate what doubtful may ensue more in this place to utter is not safe assemble thou of all those myriads which we lead the chief tell them that by command ere yet dim night her shadowy cloud withdraws i am to haste and all who under me their banners wave homeward with flying march where we possess the quarters of the north there to prepare fit entertainment to receive our king the great messiah and his new commands who speedily through all the hierarchies intends to pass triumphant and give laws so spake the false arch-angel and infused bad influence into the unwary breast of his associate he together calls or several one by one the regent powers under him regent tells as he was taught that the most high commanding now ere night now ere dim night had disincumbered heaven the great hierarchal standard was to move tells the suggested cause and casts between ambiguous words and jealousies to sound or taint integrity but all obeyed the wonted signal and superiour voice of their great potentate for great indeed his name and high was his degree in heaven his countenance as the morning-star that guides the starry flock allured them and with lies drew after him the third part of heaven's host mean while the eternal eye whose sight discerns abstrusest thoughts from forth his holy mount and from within the golden lamps that burn nightly before him saw without their light rebellion rising saw in whom how spread among the sons of morn what multitudes were banded to oppose his high decree and smiling to his only son thus said son thou in whom my glory i behold in full resplendence heir of all my might nearly it now concerns us to be sure of our omnipotence and with what arms we mean to hold what anciently we claim of deity or empire such a foe is rising who intends to erect his throne equal to ours throughout the spacious north nor so content hath in his thought to try in battle what our power is or our right let us advise and to this hazard draw with speed what force is left and all employ in our defence lest unawares we lose this our high place our sanctuary our hill to whom the son with calm aspect and clear lightning divine ineffable serene made answer mighty father thou thy foes justly hast in derision and secure laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain matter to me of glory whom their hate illustrates when they see all regal power given me to quell their pride and in event know whether i be dextrous to subdue thy rebels or be found the worst in heaven so spake the son but satan with his powers far was advanced on winged speed an host innumerable as the stars of night or stars of morning dew-drops which the sun impearls on every leaf and every flower regions they passed the mighty regencies of seraphim and potentates and thrones in their triple degrees regions to which all thy dominion adam is no more than what this garden is to all the earth and all the sea from one entire globose stretched into longitude which having passed at length into the limits of the north they came and satan to his royal seat high on a hill far blazing as a mount raised on a mount with pyramids and towers from diamond quarries hewn and rocks of gold the palace of great lucifer so call that structure in the dialect of men interpreted which not long after he affecting all equality with god in imitation of that mount whereon messiah was declared in sight of heaven the mountain of the congregation called for thither he assembled all his train pretending so commanded to consult about the great reception of their king thither to come and with calumnious art of counterfeited truth thus held their ears thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers if these magnifick titles yet remain not merely titular since by decree another now hath to himself engrossed all power and us eclipsed under the name of king anointed for whom all this haste of midnight-march and hurried meeting here this only to consult how we may best with what may be devised of honours new receive him coming to receive from us knee-tribute yet unpaid prostration vile too much to one but double how endured to one and to his image now proclaimed but what if better counsels might erect our minds and teach us to cast off this yoke will ye submit your necks and choose to bend the supple knee ye will not if i trust to know ye right or if ye know yourselves natives and sons of heaven possessed before by none and if not equal all yet free equally free for orders and degrees jar not with liberty but well consist who can in reason then or right assume monarchy over such as live by right his equals if in power and splendour less in freedom equal or can introduce law and edict on us who without law err not much less for this to be our lord and look for adoration to the abuse of those imperial titles which assert our being ordained to govern not to serve thus far his bold discourse without controul had audience when among the seraphim abdiel than whom none with more zeal adored the deity and divine commands obeyed stood up and in a flame of zeal severe the current of his fury thus opposed o argument blasphemous false and proud words which no ear ever to hear in heaven expected least of all from thee ingrate in place thyself so high above thy peers canst thou with impious obloquy condemn the just decree of god pronounced and sworn that to his only son by right endued with regal scepter every soul in heaven shall bend the knee and in that honour due confess him rightful king unjust thou sayest flatly unjust to bind with laws the free and equal over equals to let reign one over all with unsucceeded power shalt thou give law to god shalt thou dispute with him the points of liberty who made thee what thou art and formed the powers of heaven such as he pleased and circumscribed their being yet by experience taught we know how good and of our good and of our dignity how provident he is how far from thought to make us less bent rather to exalt our happy state under one head more near united but to grant it thee unjust that equal over equals monarch reign thyself though great and glorious dost thou count or all angelick nature joined in one equal to him begotten son by whom as by his word the mighty father made all things even thee and all the spirits of heaven by him created in their bright degrees crowned them with glory and to their glory named thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers essential powers nor by his reign obscured but more illustrious made since he the head one of our number thus reduced becomes his laws our laws all honour to him done returns our own cease then this impious rage and tempt not these but hasten to appease the incensed father and the incensed son while pardon may be found in time besought so spake the fervent angel but his zeal none seconded as out of season judged or singular and rash whereat rejoiced the apostate and more haughty thus replied that we were formed then sayest thou and the work of secondary hands by task transferred from father to his son strange point and new doctrine which we would know whence learned who saw when this creation was rememberest thou thy making while the maker gave thee being we know no time when we were not as now know none before us self-begot self-raised by our own quickening power when fatal course had circled his full orb the birth mature of this our native heaven ethereal sons our puissance is our own our own right hand shall teach us highest deeds by proof to try who is our equal then thou shalt behold whether by supplication we intend address and to begirt the almighty throne beseeching or besieging this report these tidings carry to the anointed king and fly ere evil intercept thy flight he said and as the sound of waters deep hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause through the infinite host nor less for that the flaming seraph fearless though alone encompassed round with foes thus answered bold o alienate from god o spirit accursed forsaken of all good i see thy fall determined and thy hapless crew involved in this perfidious fraud contagion spread both of thy crime and punishment henceforth no more be troubled how to quit the yoke of god's messiah those indulgent laws will not be now vouchsafed other decrees against thee are gone forth without recall that golden scepter which thou didst reject is now an iron rod to bruise and break thy disobedience well thou didst advise yet not for thy advice or threats i fly these wicked tents devoted lest the wrath impendent raging into sudden flame distinguish not for soon expect to feel his thunder on thy head devouring fire then who created thee lamenting learn when who can uncreate thee thou shalt know so spake the seraph abdiel faithful found among the faithless faithful only he among innumerable false unmoved unshaken unseduced unterrified his loyalty he kept his love his zeal nor number nor example with him wrought to swerve from truth or change his constant mind though single from amidst them forth he passed long way through hostile scorn which he sustained superiour nor of violence feared aught and with retorted scorn his back he turned on those proud towers to swift destruction doomed book vi all night the dreadless angel unpursued through heaven's wide champain held his way till morn waked by the circling hours with rosy hand unbarred the gates of light there is a cave within the mount of god fast by his throne where light and darkness in perpetual round lodge and dislodge by turns which makes through heaven grateful vicissitude like day and night light issues forth and at the other door obsequious darkness enters till her hour to veil the heaven though darkness there might well seem twilight here and now went forth the morn such as in highest heaven arrayed in gold empyreal from before her vanished night shot through with orient beams when all the plain covered with thick embattled squadrons bright chariots and flaming arms and fiery steeds reflecting blaze on blaze first met his view war he perceived war in procinct and found already known what he for news had thought to have reported gladly then he mixed among those friendly powers who him received with joy and acclamations loud that one that of so many myriads fallen yet one returned not lost on to the sacred hill they led him high applauded and present before the seat supreme from whence a voice from midst a golden cloud thus mild was heard servant of god well done well hast thou fought the better fight who single hast maintained against revolted multitudes the cause of truth in word mightier than they in arms and for the testimony of truth hast borne universal reproach far worse to bear than violence for this was all thy care to stand approved in sight of god though worlds judged thee perverse the easier conquest now remains thee aided by this host of friends back on thy foes more glorious to return than scorned thou didst depart and to subdue by force who reason for their law refuse right reason for their law and for their king messiah who by right of merit reigns go michael of celestial armies prince and thou in military prowess next gabriel lead forth to battle these my sons invincible lead forth my armed saints by thousands and by millions ranged for fight equal in number to that godless crew rebellious them with fire and hostile arms fearless assault and to the brow of heaven pursuing drive them out from god and bliss into their place of punishment the gulf of tartarus which ready opens wide his fiery chaos to receive their fall so spake the sovran voice and clouds began to darken all the hill and smoke to roll in dusky wreaths reluctant flames the sign of wrath awaked nor with less dread the loud ethereal trumpet from on high 'gan blow at which command the powers militant that stood for heaven in mighty quadrate joined of union irresistible moved on in silence their bright legions to the sound of instrumental harmony that breathed heroick ardour to adventurous deeds under their god-like leaders in the cause of god and his messiah on they move indissolubly firm nor obvious hill nor straitening vale nor wood nor stream divides their perfect ranks for high above the ground their march was and the passive air upbore their nimble tread as when the total kind of birds in orderly array on wing came summoned over eden to receive their names of thee so over many a tract of heaven they marched and many a province wide tenfold the length of this terrene at last far in the horizon to the north appeared from skirt to skirt a fiery region stretched in battailous aspect and nearer view bristled with upright beams innumerable of rigid spears and helmets thronged and shields various with boastful argument portrayed the banded powers of satan hasting on with furious expedition for they weened that self-same day by fight or by surprise to win the mount of god and on his throne to set the envier of his state the proud aspirer but their thoughts proved fond and vain in the mid way though strange to us it seemed at first that angel should with angel war and in fierce hosting meet who wont to meet so oft in festivals of joy and love unanimous as sons of one great sire hymning the eternal father but the shout of battle now began and rushing sound of onset ended soon each milder thought high in the midst exalted as a god the apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat idol of majesty divine enclosed with flaming cherubim and golden shields then lighted from his gorgeous throne for now twixt host and host but narrow space was left a dreadful interval and front to front presented stood in terrible array of hideous length before the cloudy van on the rough edge of battle ere it joined satan with vast and haughty strides advanced came towering armed in adamant and gold abdiel that sight endured not where he stood among the mightiest bent on highest deeds and thus his own undaunted heart explores o heaven that such resemblance of the highest should yet remain where faith and realty remain not wherefore should not strength and might there fail where virtue fails or weakest prove where boldest though to fight unconquerable his puissance trusting in the almighty's aid i mean to try whose reason i have tried unsound and false nor is it aught but just that he who in debate of truth hath won should win in arms in both disputes alike victor though brutish that contest and foul when reason hath to deal with force yet so most reason is that reason overcome so pondering and from his armed peers forth stepping opposite half-way he met his daring foe at this prevention more incensed and thus securely him defied proud art thou met thy hope was to have reached the highth of thy aspiring unopposed the throne of god unguarded and his side abandoned at the terrour of thy power or potent tongue fool not to think how vain against the omnipotent to rise in arms who out of smallest things could without end have raised incessant armies to defeat thy folly or with solitary hand reaching beyond all limit at one blow unaided could have finished thee and whelmed thy legions under darkness but thou seest all are not of thy train there be who faith prefer and piety to god though then to thee not visible when i alone seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent from all my sect thou seest now learn too late how few sometimes may know when thousands err whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance thus answered ill for thee but in wished hour of my revenge first sought for thou returnest from flight seditious angel to receive thy merited reward the first assay of this right hand provoked since first that tongue inspired with contradiction durst oppose a third part of the gods in synod met their deities to assert who while they feel vigour divine within them can allow omnipotence to none but well thou comest before thy fellows ambitious to win from me some plume that thy success may show destruction to the rest this pause between unanswered lest thou boast to let thee know at first i thought that liberty and heaven to heavenly souls had been all one but now i see that most through sloth had rather serve ministring spirits trained up in feast and song such hast thou armed the minstrelsy of heaven servility with freedom to contend as both their deeds compared this day shall prove to whom in brief thus abdiel stern replied apostate still thou errest nor end wilt find of erring from the path of truth remote unjustly thou depravest it with the name of servitude to serve whom god ordains or nature god and nature bid the same when he who rules is worthiest and excels them whom he governs this is servitude to serve the unwise or him who hath rebelled against his worthier as thine now serve thee thyself not free but to thyself enthralled yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid reign thou in hell thy kingdom let me serve in heaven god ever blest and his divine behests obey worthiest to be obeyed yet chains in hell not realms expect mean while from me returned as erst thou saidst from flight this greeting on thy impious crest receive so saying a noble stroke he lifted high which hung not but so swift with tempest fell on the proud crest of satan that no sight nor motion of swift thought less could his shield such ruin intercept ten paces huge he back recoiled the tenth on bended knee his massy spear upstaid as if on earth winds under ground or waters forcing way sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat half sunk with all his pines amazement seised the rebel thrones but greater rage to see thus foiled their mightiest ours joy filled and shout presage of victory and fierce desire of battle whereat michael bid sound the arch-angel trumpet through the vast of heaven it sounded and the faithful armies rung hosanna to the highest nor stood at gaze the adverse legions nor less hideous joined the horrid shock now storming fury rose and clamour such as heard in heaven till now was never arms on armour clashing brayed horrible discord and the madding wheels of brazen chariots raged dire was the noise of conflict over head the dismal hiss of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew and flying vaulted either host with fire so under fiery cope together rushed both battles main with ruinous assault and inextinguishable rage all heaven resounded and had earth been then all earth had to her center shook what wonder when millions of fierce encountering angels fought on either side the least of whom could wield these elements and arm him with the force of all their regions how much more of power army against army numberless to raise dreadful combustion warring and disturb though not destroy their happy native seat had not the eternal king omnipotent from his strong hold of heaven high over-ruled and limited their might though numbered such as each divided legion might have seemed a numerous host in strength each armed hand a legion led in fight yet leader seemed each warriour single as in chief expert when to advance or stand or turn the sway of battle open when and when to close the ridges of grim war no thought of flight none of retreat no unbecoming deed that argued fear each on himself relied as only in his arm the moment lay of victory deeds of eternal fame were done but infinite for wide was spread that war and various sometimes on firm ground a standing fight then soaring on main wing tormented all the air all air seemed then conflicting fire long time in even scale the battle hung till satan who that day prodigious power had shown and met in arms no equal ranging through the dire attack of fighting seraphim confused at length saw where the sword of michael smote and felled squadrons at once with huge two-handed sway brandished aloft the horrid edge came down wide-wasting such destruction to withstand he hasted and opposed the rocky orb of tenfold adamant his ample shield a vast circumference at his approach the great arch-angel from his warlike toil surceased and glad as hoping here to end intestine war in heaven the arch-foe subdued or captive dragged in chains with hostile frown and visage all inflamed first thus began author of evil unknown till thy revolt unnamed in heaven now plenteous as thou seest these acts of hateful strife hateful to all though heaviest by just measure on thyself and thy adherents how hast thou disturbed heaven's blessed peace and into nature brought misery uncreated till the crime of thy rebellion how hast thou instilled thy malice into thousands once upright and faithful now proved false but think not here to trouble holy rest heaven casts thee out from all her confines heaven the seat of bliss brooks not the works of violence and war hence then and evil go with thee along thy offspring to the place of evil hell thou and thy wicked crew there mingle broils ere this avenging sword begin thy doom or some more sudden vengeance winged from god precipitate thee with augmented pain so spake the prince of angels to whom thus the adversary nor think thou with wind of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds thou canst not hast thou turned the least of these to flight or if to fall but that they rise unvanquished easier to transact with me that thou shouldst hope imperious and with threats to chase me hence err not that so shall end the strife which thou callest evil but we style the strife of glory which we mean to win or turn this heaven itself into the hell thou fablest here however to dwell free if not to reign mean while thy utmost force and join him named almighty to thy aid i fly not but have sought thee far and nigh they ended parle and both addressed for fight unspeakable for who though with the tongue of angels can relate or to what things liken on earth conspicuous that may lift human imagination to such highth of godlike power for likest gods they seemed stood they or moved in stature motion arms fit to decide the empire of great heaven now waved their fiery swords and in the air made horrid circles two broad suns their shields blazed opposite while expectation stood in horrour from each hand with speed retired where erst was thickest fight the angelick throng and left large field unsafe within the wind of such commotion such as to set forth great things by small if nature's concord broke among the constellations war were sprung two planets rushing from aspect malign of fiercest opposition in mid sky should combat and their jarring spheres confound together both with next to almighty arm up-lifted imminent one stroke they aimed that might determine and not need repeat as not of power at once nor odds appeared in might or swift prevention but the sword of michael from the armoury of god was given him tempered so that neither keen nor solid might resist that edge it met the sword of satan with steep force to smite descending and in half cut sheer nor staid but with swift wheel reverse deep entering shared all his right side then satan first knew pain and writhed him to and fro convolved so sore the griding sword with discontinuous wound passed through him but the ethereal substance closed not long divisible and from the gash a stream of necturous humour issuing flowed sanguine such as celestial spirits may bleed and all his armour stained ere while so bright forthwith on all sides to his aid was run by angels many and strong who interposed defence while others bore him on their shields back to his chariot where it stood retired from off the files of war there they him laid gnashing for anguish and despite and shame to find himself not matchless and his pride humbled by such rebuke so far beneath his confidence to equal god in power yet soon he healed for spirits that live throughout vital in every part not as frail man in entrails heart of head liver or reins cannot but by annihilating die nor in their liquid texture mortal wound receive no more than can the fluid air all heart they live all head all eye all ear all intellect all sense and as they please they limb themselves and colour shape or size assume as kikes them best condense or rare mean while in other parts like deeds deserved memorial where the might of gabriel fought and with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array of moloch furious king who him defied and at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound threatened nor from the holy one of heaven refrained his tongue blasphemous but anon down cloven to the waist with shattered arms and uncouth pain fled bellowing on each wing uriel and raphael his vaunting foe though huge and in a rock of diamond armed vanquished adramelech and asmadai two potent thrones that to be less than gods disdained but meaner thoughts learned in their flight mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail nor stood unmindful abdiel to annoy the atheist crew but with redoubled blow ariel and arioch and the violence of ramiel scorched and blasted overthrew i might relate of thousands and their names eternize here on earth but those elect angels contented with their fame in heaven seek not the praise of men the other sort in might though wonderous and in acts of war nor of renown less eager yet by doom cancelled from heaven and sacred memory nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell for strength from truth divided and from just illaudable nought merits but dispraise and ignominy yet to glory aspires vain-glorious and through infamy seeks fame therefore eternal silence be their doom and now their mightiest quelled the battle swerved with many an inroad gored deformed rout entered and foul disorder all the ground with shivered armour strown and on a heap chariot and charioteer lay overturned and fiery-foaming steeds what stood recoiled o'er-wearied through the faint satanick host defensive scarce or with pale fear surprised then first with fear surprised and sense of pain fled ignominious to such evil brought by sin of disobedience till that hour not liable to fear or flight or pain far otherwise the inviolable saints in cubick phalanx firm advanced entire invulnerable impenetrably armed such high advantages their innocence gave them above their foes not to have sinned not to have disobeyed in fight they stood unwearied unobnoxious to be pained by wound though from their place by violence moved now night her course began and over heaven inducing darkness grateful truce imposed and silence on the odious din of war under her cloudy covert both retired victor and vanquished on the foughten field michael and his angels prevalent encamping placed in guard their watches round cherubick waving fires on the other part satan with his rebellious disappeared far in the dark dislodged and void of rest his potentates to council called by night and in the midst thus undismayed began o now in danger tried now known in arms not to be overpowered companions dear found worthy not of liberty alone too mean pretence but what we more affect honour dominion glory and renown who have sustained one day in doubtful fight and if one day why not eternal days what heaven's lord had powerfullest to send against us from about his throne and judged sufficient to subdue us to his will but proves not so then fallible it seems of future we may deem him though till now omniscient thought true is less firmly armed some disadvantage we endured and pain till now not known but known as soon contemned since now we find this our empyreal form incapable of mortal injury imperishable and though pierced with wound soon closing and by native vigour healed of evil then so small as easy think the remedy perhaps more valid arms weapons more violent when next we meet may serve to better us and worse our foes or equal what between us made the odds in nature none if other hidden cause left them superiour while we can preserve unhurt our minds and understanding sound due search and consultation will disclose he sat and in the assembly next upstood nisroch of principalities the prime as one he stood escaped from cruel fight sore toiled his riven arms to havock hewn and cloudy in aspect thus answering spake deliverer from new lords leader to free enjoyment of our right as gods yet hard for gods and too unequal work we find against unequal arms to fight in pain against unpained impassive from which evil ruin must needs ensue for what avails valour or strength though matchless quelled with pain which all subdues and makes remiss the hands of mightiest sense of pleasure we may well spare out of life perhaps and not repine but live content which is the calmest life but pain is perfect misery the worst of evils and excessive overturns all patience he who therefore can invent with what more forcible we may offend our yet unwounded enemies or arm ourselves with like defence to me deserves no less than for deliverance what we owe whereto with look composed satan replied not uninvented that which thou aright believest so main to our success i bring which of us who beholds the bright surface of this ethereous mould whereon we stand this continent of spacious heaven adorned with plant fruit flower ambrosial gems and gold whose eye so superficially surveys these things as not to mind from whence they grow deep under ground materials dark and crude of spiritous and fiery spume till touched with heaven's ray and tempered they shoot forth so beauteous opening to the ambient light these in their dark nativity the deep shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame which into hollow engines long and round thick rammed at the other bore with touch of fire dilated and infuriate shall send forth from far with thundering noise among our foes such implements of mischief as shall dash to pieces and o'erwhelm whatever stands adverse that they shall fear we have disarmed the thunderer of his only dreaded bolt nor long shall be our labour yet ere dawn effect shall end our wish mean while revive abandon fear to strength and counsel joined think nothing hard much less to be despaired he ended and his words their drooping cheer enlightened and their languished hope revived the invention all admired and each how he to be the inventer missed so easy it seemed once found which yet unfound most would have thought impossible yet haply of thy race in future days if malice should abound some one intent on mischief or inspired with devilish machination might devise like instrument to plague the sons of men for sin on war and mutual slaughter bent forthwith from council to the work they flew none arguing stood innumerable hands were ready in a moment up they turned wide the celestial soil and saw beneath the originals of nature in their crude conception sulphurous and nitrous foam they found they mingled and with subtle art concocted and adusted they reduced to blackest grain and into store conveyed part hidden veins digged up nor hath this earth entrails unlike of mineral and stone whereof to found their engines and their balls of missive ruin part incentive reed provide pernicious with one touch to fire so all ere day-spring under conscious night secret they finished and in order set with silent circumspection unespied now when fair morn orient in heaven appeared up rose the victor-angels and to arms the matin trumpet sung in arms they stood of golden panoply refulgent host soon banded others from the dawning hills look round and scouts each coast light-armed scour each quarter to descry the distant foe where lodged or whither fled or if for fight in motion or in halt him soon they met under spread ensigns moving nigh in slow but firm battalion back with speediest sail zophiel of cherubim the swiftest wing came flying and in mid air aloud thus cried arm warriours arm for fight the foe at hand whom fled we thought will save us long pursuit this day fear not his flight so thick a cloud he comes and settled in his face i see sad resolution and secure let each his adamantine coat gird well and each fit well his helm gripe fast his orbed shield borne even or high for this day will pour down if i conjecture aught no drizzling shower but rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire so warned he them aware themselves and soon in order quit of all impediment instant without disturb they took alarm and onward moved embattled when behold not distant far with heavy pace the foe approaching gross and huge in hollow cube training his devilish enginery impaled on every side with shadowing squadrons deep to hide the fraud at interview both stood a while but suddenly at head appeared satan and thus was heard commanding loud vanguard to right and left the front unfold that all may see who hate us how we seek peace and composure and with open breast stand ready to receive them if they like our overture and turn not back perverse but that i doubt however witness heaven heaven witness thou anon while we discharge freely our part ye who appointed stand do as you have in charge and briefly touch what we propound and loud that all may hear so scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce had ended when to right and left the front divided and to either flank retired which to our eyes discovered new and strange a triple mounted row of pillars laid on wheels for like to pillars most they seemed or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir with branches lopt in wood or mountain felled brass iron stony mould had not their mouths with hideous orifice gaped on us wide portending hollow truce at each behind a seraph stood and in his hand a reed stood waving tipt with fire while we suspense collected stood within our thoughts amused not long for sudden all at once their reeds put forth and to a narrow vent applied with nicest touch immediate in a flame but soon obscured with smoke all heaven appeared from those deep-throated engines belched whose roar embowelled with outrageous noise the air and all her entrails tore disgorging foul their devilish glut chained thunderbolts and hail of iron globes which on the victor host levelled with such impetuous fury smote that whom they hit none on their feet might stand though standing else as rocks but down they fell by thousands angel on arch-angel rolled the sooner for their arms unarmed they might have easily as spirits evaded swift by quick contraction or remove but now foul dissipation followed and forced rout nor served it to relax their serried files what should they do if on they rushed repulse repeated and indecent overthrow doubled would render them yet more despised and to their foes a laughter for in view stood ranked of seraphim another row in posture to displode their second tire of thunder back defeated to return they worse abhorred satan beheld their plight and to his mates thus in derision called o friends why come not on these victors proud ere while they fierce were coming and when we to entertain them fair with open front and breast what could we more propounded terms of composition straight they changed their minds flew off and into strange vagaries fell as they would dance yet for a dance they seemed somewhat extravagant and wild perhaps for joy of offered peace but i suppose if our proposals once again were heard we should compel them to a quick result to whom thus belial in like gamesome mood leader the terms we sent were terms of weight of hard contents and full of force urged home such as we might perceive amused them all and stumbled many who receives them right had need from head to foot well understand not understood this gift they have besides they show us when our foes walk not upright so they among themselves in pleasant vein stood scoffing hightened in their thoughts beyond all doubt of victory eternal might to match with their inventions they presumed so easy and of his thunder made a scorn and all his host derided while they stood a while in trouble but they stood not long rage prompted them at length and found them arms against such hellish mischief fit to oppose forthwith behold the excellence the power which god hath in his mighty angels placed their arms away they threw and to the hills for earth hath this variety from heaven of pleasure situate in hill and dale light as the lightning glimpse they ran they flew from their foundations loosening to and fro they plucked the seated hills with all their load rocks waters woods and by the shaggy tops up-lifting bore them in their hands amaze be sure and terrour seized the rebel host when coming towards them so dread they saw the bottom of the mountains upward turned till on those cursed engines' triple-row they saw them whelmed and all their confidence under the weight of mountains buried deep themselves invaded next and on their heads main promontories flung which in the air came shadowing and oppressed whole legions armed their armour helped their harm crushed in and bruised into their substance pent which wrought them pain implacable and many a dolorous groan long struggling underneath ere they could wind out of such prison though spirits of purest light purest at first now gross by sinning grown the rest in imitation to like arms betook them and the neighbouring hills uptore so hills amid the air encountered hills hurled to and fro with jaculation dire that under ground they fought in dismal shade infernal noise war seemed a civil game to this uproar horrid confusion heaped upon confusion rose and now all heaven had gone to wrack with ruin overspread had not the almighty father where he sits shrined in his sanctuary of heaven secure consulting on the sum of things foreseen this tumult and permitted all advised that his great purpose he might so fulfil to honour his anointed son avenged upon his enemies and to declare all power on him transferred whence to his son the assessour of his throne he thus began effulgence of my glory son beloved son in whose face invisible is beheld visibly what by deity i am and in whose hand what by decree i do second omnipotence two days are past two days as we compute the days of heaven since michael and his powers went forth to tame these disobedient sore hath been their fight as likeliest was when two such foes met armed for to themselves i left them and thou knowest equal in their creation they were formed save what sin hath impaired which yet hath wrought insensibly for i suspend their doom whence in perpetual fight they needs must last endless and no solution will be found war wearied hath performed what war can do and to disordered rage let loose the reins with mountains as with weapons armed which makes wild work in heaven and dangerous to the main two days are therefore past the third is thine for thee i have ordained it and thus far have suffered that the glory may be thine of ending this great war since none but thou can end it into thee such virtue and grace immense i have transfused that all may know in heaven and hell thy power above compare and this perverse commotion governed thus to manifest thee worthiest to be heir of all things to be heir and to be king by sacred unction thy deserved right go then thou mightiest in thy father's might ascend my chariot guide the rapid wheels that shake heaven's basis bring forth all my war my bow and thunder my almighty arms gird on and sword upon thy puissant thigh pursue these sons of darkness drive them out from all heaven's bounds into the utter deep there let them learn as likes them to despise god and messiah his anointed king he said and on his son with rays direct shone full he all his father full expressed ineffably into his face received and thus the filial godhead answering spake o father o supreme of heavenly thrones first highest holiest best thou always seek'st to glorify thy son i always thee as is most just this i my glory account my exaltation and my whole delight that thou in me well pleased declarest thy will fulfilled which to fulfil is all my bliss scepter and power thy giving i assume and gladlier shall resign when in the end thou shalt be all in all and i in thee for ever and in me all whom thou lovest but whom thou hatest i hate and can put on thy terrours as i put thy mildness on image of thee in all things and shall soon armed with thy might rid heaven of these rebelled to their prepared ill mansion driven down to chains of darkness and the undying worm that from thy just obedience could revolt whom to obey is happiness entire then shall thy saints unmixed and from the impure far separate circling thy holy mount unfeigned halleluiahs to thee sing hymns of high praise and i among them chief so said he o'er his scepter bowing rose from the right hand of glory where he sat and the third sacred morn began to shine dawning through heaven forth rushed with whirlwind sound the chariot of paternal deity flashing thick flames wheel within wheel undrawn itself instinct with spirit but convoyed by four cherubick shapes four faces each had wonderous as with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between over their heads a crystal firmament whereon a sapphire throne inlaid with pure amber and colours of the showery arch he in celestial panoply all armed of radiant urim work divinely wrought ascended at his right hand victory sat eagle-winged beside him hung his bow and quiver with three-bolted thunder stored and from about him fierce effusion rolled of smoke and bickering flame and sparkles dire attended with ten thousand thousand saints he onward came far off his coming shone and twenty thousand i their number heard chariots of god half on each hand were seen he on the wings of cherub rode sublime on the crystalline sky in sapphire throned illustrious far and wide but by his own first seen them unexpected joy surprised when the great ensign of messiah blazed aloft by angels borne his sign in heaven under whose conduct michael soon reduced his army circumfused on either wing under their head imbodied all in one before him power divine his way prepared at his command the uprooted hills retired each to his place they heard his voice and went obsequious heaven his wonted face renewed and with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled this saw his hapless foes but stood obdured and to rebellious fight rallied their powers insensate hope conceiving from despair in heavenly spirits could such perverseness dwell but to convince the proud what signs avail or wonders move the obdurate to relent they hardened more by what might most reclaim grieving to see his glory at the sight took envy and aspiring to his highth stood re-embattled fierce by force or fraud weening to prosper and at length prevail against god and messiah or to fall in universal ruin last and now to final battle drew disdaining flight or faint retreat when the great son of god to all his host on either hand thus spake stand still in bright array ye saints here stand ye angels armed this day from battle rest faithful hath been your warfare and of god accepted fearless in his righteous cause and as ye have received so have ye done invincibly but of this cursed crew the punishment to other hand belongs vengeance is his or whose he sole appoints number to this day's work is not ordained nor multitude stand only and behold god's indignation on these godless poured by me not you but me they have despised yet envied against me is all their rage because the father to whom in heaven s'preme kingdom and power and glory appertains hath honoured me according to his will therefore to me their doom he hath assigned that they may have their wish to try with me in battle which the stronger proves they all or i alone against them since by strength they measure all of other excellence not emulous nor care who them excels nor other strife with them do i vouchsafe so spake the son and into terrour changed his countenance too severe to be beheld and full of wrath bent on his enemies at once the four spread out their starry wings with dreadful shade contiguous and the orbs of his fierce chariot rolled as with the sound of torrent floods or of a numerous host he on his impious foes right onward drove gloomy as night under his burning wheels the stedfast empyrean shook throughout all but the throne itself of god full soon among them he arrived in his right hand grasping ten thousand thunders which he sent before him such as in their souls infixed plagues they astonished all resistance lost all courage down their idle weapons dropt o'er shields and helms and helmed heads he rode of thrones and mighty seraphim prostrate that wished the mountains now might be again thrown on them as a shelter from his ire nor less on either side tempestuous fell his arrows from the fourfold-visaged four distinct with eyes and from the living wheels distinct alike with multitude of eyes one spirit in them ruled and every eye glared lightning and shot forth pernicious fire among the accursed that withered all their strength and of their wonted vigour left them drained exhausted spiritless afflicted fallen yet half his strength he put not forth but checked his thunder in mid volley for he meant not to destroy but root them out of heaven the overthrown he raised and as a herd of goats or timorous flock together thronged drove them before him thunder-struck pursued with terrours and with furies to the bounds and crystal wall of heaven which opening wide rolled inward and a spacious gap disclosed into the wasteful deep the monstrous sight struck them with horrour backward but far worse urged them behind headlong themselves they threw down from the verge of heaven eternal wrath burnt after them to the bottomless pit hell heard the unsufferable noise hell saw heaven ruining from heaven and would have fled affrighted but strict fate had cast too deep her dark foundations and too fast had bound nine days they fell confounded chaos roared and felt tenfold confusion in their fall through his wild anarchy so huge a rout incumbered him with ruin hell at last yawning received them whole and on them closed hell their fit habitation fraught with fire unquenchable the house of woe and pain disburdened heaven rejoiced and soon repaired her mural breach returning whence it rolled sole victor from the expulsion of his foes messiah his triumphal chariot turned to meet him all his saints who silent stood eye-witnesses of his almighty acts with jubilee advanced and as they went shaded with branching palm each order bright sung triumph and him sung victorious king son heir and lord to him dominion given worthiest to reign he celebrated rode triumphant through mid heaven into the courts and temple of his mighty father throned on high who into glory him received where now he sits at the right hand of bliss thus measuring things in heaven by things on earth at thy request and that thou mayest beware by what is past to thee i have revealed what might have else to human race been hid the discord which befel and war in heaven among the angelick powers and the deep fall of those too high aspiring who rebelled with satan he who envies now thy state who now is plotting how he may seduce thee also from obedience that with him bereaved of happiness thou mayest partake his punishment eternal misery which would be all his solace and revenge as a despite done against the most high thee once to gain companion of his woe but listen not to his temptations warn thy weaker let it profit thee to have heard by terrible example the reward of disobedience firm they might have stood yet fell remember and fear to transgress book vii descend from heaven urania by that name if rightly thou art called whose voice divine following above the olympian hill i soar above the flight of pegasean wing the meaning not the name i call for thou nor of the muses nine nor on the top of old olympus dwellest but heavenly-born before the hills appeared or fountain flowed thou with eternal wisdom didst converse wisdom thy sister and with her didst play in presence of the almighty father pleased with thy celestial song up led by thee into the heaven of heavens i have presumed an earthly guest and drawn empyreal air thy tempering with like safety guided down return me to my native element lest from this flying steed unreined as once bellerophon though from a lower clime dismounted on the aleian field i fall erroneous there to wander and forlorn half yet remains unsung but narrower bound within the visible diurnal sphere standing on earth not rapt above the pole more safe i sing with mortal voice unchanged to hoarse or mute though fallen on evil days on evil days though fallen and evil tongues in darkness and with dangers compassed round and solitude yet not alone while thou visitest my slumbers nightly or when morn purples the east still govern thou my song urania and fit audience find though few but drive far off the barbarous dissonance of bacchus and his revellers the race of that wild rout that tore the thracian bard in rhodope where woods and rocks had ears to rapture till the savage clamour drowned both harp and voice nor could the muse defend her son so fail not thou who thee implores for thou art heavenly she an empty dream say goddess what ensued when raphael the affable arch-angel had forewarned adam by dire example to beware apostasy by what befel in heaven to those apostates lest the like befall in paradise to adam or his race charged not to touch the interdicted tree if they transgress and slight that sole command so easily obeyed amid the choice of all tastes else to please their appetite though wandering he with his consorted eve the story heard attentive and was filled with admiration and deep muse to hear of things so high and strange things to their thought so unimaginable as hate in heaven and war so near the peace of god in bliss with such confusion but the evil soon driven back redounded as a flood on those from whom it sprung impossible to mix with blessedness whence adam soon repealed the doubts that in his heart arose and now led on yet sinless with desire to know what nearer might concern him how this world of heaven and earth conspicuous first began when and whereof created for what cause what within eden or without was done before his memory as one whose drouth yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest great things and full of wonder in our ears far differing from this world thou hast revealed divine interpreter by favour sent down from the empyrean to forewarn us timely of what might else have been our loss unknown which human knowledge could not reach for which to the infinitely good we owe immortal thanks and his admonishment receive with solemn purpose to observe immutably his sovran will the end of what we are but since thou hast vouchsafed gently for our instruction to impart things above earthly thought which yet concerned our knowing as to highest wisdom seemed deign to descend now lower and relate what may no less perhaps avail us known how first began this heaven which we behold distant so high with moving fires adorned innumerable and this which yields or fills all space the ambient air wide interfused embracing round this floried earth what cause moved the creator in his holy rest through all eternity so late to build in chaos and the work begun how soon absolved if unforbid thou mayest unfold what we not to explore the secrets ask of his eternal empire but the more to magnify his works the more we know and the great light of day yet wants to run much of his race though steep suspense in heaven held by thy voice thy potent voice he hears and longer will delay to hear thee tell his generation and the rising birth of nature from the unapparent deep or if the star of evening and the moon haste to thy audience night with her will bring silence and sleep listening to thee will watch or we can bid his absence till thy song end and dismiss thee ere the morning shine thus adam his illustrious guest besought and thus the godlike angel answered mild this also thy request with caution asked obtain though to recount almighty works what words or tongue of seraph can suffice or heart of man suffice to comprehend yet what thou canst attain which best may serve to glorify the maker and infer thee also happier shall not be withheld thy hearing such commission from above i have received to answer thy desire of knowledge within bounds beyond abstain to ask nor let thine own inventions hope things not revealed which the invisible king only omniscient hath suppressed in night to none communicable in earth or heaven enough is left besides to search and know but knowledge is as food and needs no less her temperance over appetite to know in measure what the mind may well contain oppresses else with surfeit and soon turns wisdom to folly as nourishment to wind know then that after lucifer from heaven so call him brighter once amidst the host of angels than that star the stars among fell with his flaming legions through the deep into his place and the great son returned victorious with his saints the omnipotent eternal father from his throne beheld their multitude and to his son thus spake at least our envious foe hath failed who thought all like himself rebellious by whose aid this inaccessible high strength the seat of deity supreme us dispossessed he trusted to have seised and into fraud drew many whom their place knows here no more yet far the greater part have kept i see their station heaven yet populous retains number sufficient to possess her realms though wide and this high temple to frequent with ministeries due and solemn rites but lest his heart exalt him in the harm already done to have dispeopled heaven my damage fondly deemed i can repair that detriment if such it be to lose self-lost and in a moment will create another world out of one man a race of men innumerable there to dwell not here till by degrees of merit raised they open to themselves at length the way up hither under long obedience tried and earth be changed to heaven and heaven to earth one kingdom joy and union without end mean while inhabit lax ye powers of heaven and thou my word begotten son by thee this i perform speak thou and be it done my overshadowing spirit and might with thee i send along ride forth and bid the deep within appointed bounds be heaven and earth boundless the deep because i am who fill infinitude nor vacuous the space though i uncircumscribed myself retire and put not forth my goodness which is free to act or not necessity and chance approach not me and what i will is fate so spake the almighty and to what he spake his word the filial godhead gave effect immediate are the acts of god more swift than time or motion but to human ears cannot without process of speech be told so told as earthly notion can receive great triumph and rejoicing was in heaven when such was heard declared the almighty's will glory they sung to the most high good will to future men and in their dwellings peace glory to him whose just avenging ire had driven out the ungodly from his sight and the habitations of the just to him glory and praise whose wisdom had ordained good out of evil to create instead of spirits malign a better race to bring into their vacant room and thence diffuse his good to worlds and ages infinite so sang the hierarchies mean while the son on his great expedition now appeared girt with omnipotence with radiance crowned of majesty divine sapience and love immense and all his father in him shone about his chariot numberless were poured cherub and seraph potentates and thrones and virtues winged spirits and chariots winged from the armoury of god where stand of old myriads between two brazen mountains lodged against a solemn day harnessed at hand celestial equipage and now came forth spontaneous for within them spirit lived attendant on their lord heaven opened wide her ever-during gates harmonious sound on golden hinges moving to let forth the king of glory in his powerful word and spirit coming to create new worlds on heavenly ground they stood and from the shore they viewed the vast immeasurable abyss outrageous as a sea dark wasteful wild up from the bottom turned by furious winds and surging waves as mountains to assault heaven's highth and with the center mix the pole silence ye troubled waves and thou deep peace said then the omnifick word your discord end nor staid but on the wings of cherubim uplifted in paternal glory rode far into chaos and the world unborn for chaos heard his voice him all his train followed in bright procession to behold creation and the wonders of his might then staid the fervid wheels and in his hand he took the golden compasses prepared in god's eternal store to circumscribe this universe and all created things one foot he centered and the other turned round through the vast profundity obscure and said thus far extend thus far thy bounds this be thy just circumference o world thus god the heaven created thus the earth matter unformed and void darkness profound covered the abyss but on the watery calm his brooding wings the spirit of god outspread and vital virtue infused and vital warmth throughout the fluid mass but downward purged the black tartareous cold infernal dregs adverse to life then founded then conglobed like things to like the rest to several place disparted and between spun out the air and earth self-balanced on her center hung let there be light said god and forthwith light ethereal first of things quintessence pure sprung from the deep and from her native east to journey through the aery gloom began sphered in a radiant cloud for yet the sun was not she in a cloudy tabernacle sojourned the while god saw the light was good and light from darkness by the hemisphere divided light the day and darkness night he named thus was the first day even and morn nor past uncelebrated nor unsung by the celestial quires when orient light exhaling first from darkness they beheld birth-day of heaven and earth with joy and shout the hollow universal orb they filled and touched their golden harps and hymning praised god and his works creator him they sung both when first evening was and when first morn again god said let there be firmament amid the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters and god made the firmament expanse of liquid pure transparent elemental air diffused in circuit to the uttermost convex of this great round partition firm and sure the waters underneath from those above dividing for as earth so he the world built on circumfluous waters calm in wide crystalline ocean and the loud misrule of chaos far removed lest fierce extremes contiguous might distemper the whole frame and heaven he named the firmament so even and morning chorus sung the second day the earth was formed but in the womb as yet of waters embryon immature involved appeared not over all the face of earth main ocean flowed not idle but with warm prolifick humour softening all her globe fermented the great mother to conceive satiate with genial moisture when god said be gathered now ye waters under heaven into one place and let dry land appear immediately the mountains huge appear emergent and their broad bare backs upheave into the clouds their tops ascend the sky so high as heaved the tumid hills so low down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep capacious bed of waters thither they hasted with glad precipitance uprolled as drops on dust conglobing from the dry part rise in crystal wall or ridge direct for haste such flight the great command impressed on the swift floods as armies at the call of trumpet for of armies thou hast heard troop to their standard so the watery throng wave rolling after wave where way they found if steep with torrent rapture if through plain soft-ebbing nor withstood them rock or hill but they or under ground or circuit wide with serpent errour wandering found their way and on the washy oose deep channels wore easy ere god had bid the ground be dry all but within those banks where rivers now stream and perpetual draw their humid train the dry land earth and the great receptacle of congregated waters he called seas and saw that it was good and said let the earth put forth the verdant grass herb yielding seed and fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind whose seed is in herself upon the earth he scarce had said when the bare earth till then desart and bare unsightly unadorned brought forth the tender grass whose verdure clad her universal face with pleasant green then herbs of every leaf that sudden flowered opening their various colours and made gay her bosom smelling sweet and these scarce blown forth flourished thick the clustering vine forth crept the swelling gourd up stood the corny reed embattled in her field and the humble shrub and bush with frizzled hair implicit last rose as in dance the stately trees and spread their branches hung with copious fruit or gemmed their blossoms with high woods the hills were crowned with tufts the valleys and each fountain side with borders long the rivers that earth now seemed like to heaven a seat where gods might dwell or wander with delight and love to haunt her sacred shades though god had yet not rained upon the earth and man to till the ground none was but from the earth a dewy mist went up and watered all the ground and each plant of the field which ere it was in the earth god made and every herb before it grew on the green stem god saw that it was good so even and morn recorded the third day again the almighty spake let there be lights high in the expanse of heaven to divide the day from night and let them be for signs for seasons and for days and circling years and let them be for lights as i ordain their office in the firmament of heaven to give light on the earth and it was so and god made two great lights great for their use to man the greater to have rule by day the less by night altern and made the stars and set them in the firmament of heaven to illuminate the earth and rule the day in their vicissitude and rule the night and light from darkness to divide god saw surveying his great work that it was good for of celestial bodies first the sun a mighty sphere he framed unlightsome first though of ethereal mould then formed the moon globose and every magnitude of stars and sowed with stars the heaven thick as a field of light by far the greater part he took transplanted from her cloudy shrine and placed in the sun's orb made porous to receive and drink the liquid light firm to retain her gathered beams great palace now of light hither as to their fountain other stars repairing in their golden urns draw light and hence the morning-planet gilds her horns by tincture or reflection they augment their small peculiar though from human sight so far remote with diminution seen first in his east the glorious lamp was seen regent of day and all the horizon round invested with bright rays jocund to run his longitude through heaven's high road the gray dawn and the pleiades before him danced shedding sweet influence less bright the moon but opposite in levelled west was set his mirrour with full face borrowing her light from him for other light she needed none in that aspect and still that distance keeps till night then in the east her turn she shines revolved on heaven's great axle and her reign with thousand lesser lights dividual holds with thousand thousand stars that then appeared spangling the hemisphere then first adorned with their bright luminaries that set and rose glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day and god said let the waters generate reptile with spawn abundant living soul and let fowl fly above the earth with wings displayed on the open firmament of heaven and god created the great whales and each soul living each that crept which plenteously the waters generated by their kinds and every bird of wing after his kind and saw that it was good and blessed them saying be fruitful multiply and in the seas and lakes and running streams the waters fill and let the fowl be multiplied on the earth forthwith the sounds and seas each creek and bay with fry innumerable swarm and shoals of fish that with their fins and shining scales glide under the green wave in sculls that oft bank the mid sea part single or with mate graze the sea-weed their pasture and through groves of coral stray or sporting with quick glance show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold or in their pearly shells at ease attend moist nutriment or under rocks their food in jointed armour watch on smooth the seal and bended dolphins play part huge of bulk wallowing unwieldy enormous in their gait tempest the ocean there leviathan hugest of living creatures on the deep stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims and seems a moving land and at his gills draws in and at his trunk spouts out a sea mean while the tepid caves and fens and shores their brood as numerous hatch from the egg that soon bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed their callow young but feathered soon and fledge they summed their pens and soaring the air sublime with clang despised the ground under a cloud in prospect there the eagle and the stork on cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build part loosely wing the region part more wise in common ranged in figure wedge their way intelligent of seasons and set forth their aery caravan high over seas flying and over lands with mutual wing easing their flight so steers the prudent crane her annual voyage borne on winds the air floats as they pass fanned with unnumbered plumes from branch to branch the smaller birds with song solaced the woods and spread their painted wings till even nor then the solemn nightingale ceased warbling but all night tun'd her soft lays others on silver lakes and rivers bathed their downy breast the swan with arched neck between her white wings mantling proudly rows her state with oary feet yet oft they quit the dank and rising on stiff pennons tower the mid aereal sky others on ground walked firm the crested cock whose clarion sounds the silent hours and the other whose gay train adorns him coloured with the florid hue of rainbows and starry eyes the waters thus with fish replenished and the air with fowl evening and morn solemnized the fifth day the sixth and of creation last arose with evening harps and matin when god said let the earth bring forth soul living in her kind cattle and creeping things and beast of the earth each in their kind the earth obeyed and straight opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth innumerous living creatures perfect forms limbed and full grown out of the ground up rose as from his lair the wild beast where he wons in forest wild in thicket brake or den among the trees in pairs they rose they walked the cattle in the fields and meadows green those rare and solitary these in flocks pasturing at once and in broad herds upsprung the grassy clods now calved now half appeared the tawny lion pawing to get free his hinder parts then springs as broke from bonds and rampant shakes his brinded mane the ounce the libbard and the tiger as the mole rising the crumbled earth above them threw in hillocks the swift stag from under ground bore up his branching head scarce from his mould behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved his vastness fleeced the flocks and bleating rose as plants ambiguous between sea and land the river-horse and scaly crocodile at once came forth whatever creeps the ground insect or worm those waved their limber fans for wings and smallest lineaments exact in all the liveries decked of summer's pride with spots of gold and purple azure and green these as a line their long dimension drew streaking the ground with sinuous trace not all minims of nature some of serpent-kind wonderous in length and corpulence involved their snaky folds and added wings first crept the parsimonious emmet provident of future in small room large heart enclosed pattern of just equality perhaps hereafter joined in her popular tribes of commonalty swarming next appeared the female bee that feeds her husband drone deliciously and builds her waxen cells with honey stored the rest are numberless and thou their natures knowest and gavest them names needless to thee repeated nor unknown the serpent subtlest beast of all the field of huge extent sometimes with brazen eyes and hairy mane terrifick though to thee not noxious but obedient at thy call now heaven in all her glory shone and rolled her motions as the great first mover's hand first wheeled their course earth in her rich attire consummate lovely smiled air water earth by fowl fish beast was flown was swum was walked frequent and of the sixth day yet remained there wanted yet the master-work the end of all yet done a creature who not prone and brute as other creatures but endued with sanctity of reason might erect his stature and upright with front serene govern the rest self-knowing and from thence magnanimous to correspond with heaven but grateful to acknowledge whence his good descends thither with heart and voice and eyes directed in devotion to adore and worship god supreme who made him chief of all his works therefore the omnipotent eternal father for where is not he present thus to his son audibly spake let us make now man in our image man in our similitude and let them rule over the fish and fowl of sea and air beast of the field and over all the earth and every creeping thing that creeps the ground this said he formed thee adam thee o man dust of the ground and in thy nostrils breathed the breath of life in his own image he created thee in the image of god express and thou becamest a living soul male he created thee but thy consort female for race then blessed mankind and said be fruitful multiply and fill the earth subdue it and throughout dominion hold over fish of the sea and fowl of the air and every living thing that moves on the earth wherever thus created for no place is yet distinct by name thence as thou knowest he brought thee into this delicious grove this garden planted with the trees of god delectable both to behold and taste and freely all their pleasant fruit for food gave thee all sorts are here that all the earth yields variety without end but of the tree which tasted works knowledge of good and evil thou mayest not in the day thou eatest thou diest death is the penalty imposed beware and govern well thy appetite lest sin surprise thee and her black attendant death here finished he and all that he had made viewed and behold all was entirely good so even and morn accomplished the sixth day yet not till the creator from his work desisting though unwearied up returned up to the heaven of heavens his high abode thence to behold this new created world the addition of his empire how it showed in prospect from his throne how good how fair answering his great idea up he rode followed with acclamation and the sound symphonious of ten thousand harps that tuned angelick harmonies the earth the air resounded thou rememberest for thou heardst the heavens and all the constellations rung the planets in their station listening stood while the bright pomp ascended jubilant open ye everlasting gates they sung open ye heavens your living doors let in the great creator from his work returned magnificent his six days work a world open and henceforth oft for god will deign to visit oft the dwellings of just men delighted and with frequent intercourse thither will send his winged messengers on errands of supernal grace so sung the glorious train ascending he through heaven that opened wide her blazing portals led to god's eternal house direct the way a broad and ample road whose dust is gold and pavement stars as stars to thee appear seen in the galaxy that milky way which nightly as a circling zone thou seest powdered with stars and now on earth the seventh evening arose in eden for the sun was set and twilight from the east came on forerunning night when at the holy mount of heaven's high-seated top the imperial throne of godhead fixed for ever firm and sure the filial power arrived and sat him down with his great father for he also went invisible yet staid such privilege hath omnipresence and the work ordained author and end of all things and from work now resting blessed and hallowed the seventh day as resting on that day from all his work but not in silence holy kept the harp had work and rested not the solemn pipe and dulcimer all organs of sweet stop all sounds on fret by string or golden wire tempered soft tunings intermixed with voice choral or unison of incense clouds fuming from golden censers hid the mount creation and the six days acts they sung great are thy works jehovah infinite thy power what thought can measure thee or tongue relate thee greater now in thy return than from the giant angels thee that day thy thunders magnified but to create is greater than created to destroy who can impair thee mighty king or bound thy empire easily the proud attempt of spirits apostate and their counsels vain thou hast repelled while impiously they thought thee to diminish and from thee withdraw the number of thy worshippers who seeks to lessen thee against his purpose serves to manifest the more thy might his evil thou usest and from thence createst more good witness this new-made world another heaven from heaven-gate not far founded in view on the clear hyaline the glassy sea of amplitude almost immense with stars numerous and every star perhaps a world of destined habitation but thou knowest their seasons among these the seat of men earth with her nether ocean circumfused their pleasant dwelling-place thrice happy men and sons of men whom god hath thus advanced created in his image there to dwell and worship him and in reward to rule over his works on earth in sea or air and multiply a race of worshippers holy and just thrice happy if they know their happiness and persevere upright so sung they and the empyrean rung with halleluiahs thus was sabbath kept and thy request think now fulfilled that asked how first this world and face of things began and what before thy memory was done from the beginning that posterity informed by thee might know if else thou seekest aught not surpassing human measure say book viii the angel ended and in adam's ear so charming left his voice that he a while thought him still speaking still stood fixed to hear then as new waked thus gratefully replied what thanks sufficient or what recompence equal have i to render thee divine historian who thus largely hast allayed the thirst i had of knowledge and vouchsafed this friendly condescension to relate things else by me unsearchable now heard with wonder but delight and as is due with glory attributed to the high creator something yet of doubt remains which only thy solution can resolve when i behold this goodly frame this world of heaven and earth consisting and compute their magnitudes this earth a spot a grain an atom with the firmament compared and all her numbered stars that seem to roll spaces incomprehensible for such their distance argues and their swift return diurnal merely to officiate light round this opacous earth this punctual spot one day and night in all her vast survey useless besides reasoning i oft admire how nature wise and frugal could commit such disproportions with superfluous hand so many nobler bodies to create greater so manifold to this one use for aught appears and on their orbs impose such restless revolution day by day repeated while the sedentary earth that better might with far less compass move served by more noble than herself attains her end without least motion and receives as tribute such a sumless journey brought of incorporeal speed her warmth and light speed to describe whose swiftness number fails so spake our sire and by his countenance seemed entering on studious thoughts abstruse which eve perceiving where she sat retired in sight with lowliness majestick from her seat and grace that won who saw to wish her stay rose and went forth among her fruits and flowers to visit how they prospered bud and bloom her nursery they at her coming sprung and touched by her fair tendance gladlier grew yet went she not as not with such discourse delighted or not capable her ear of what was high such pleasure she reserved adam relating she sole auditress her husband the relater she preferred before the angel and of him to ask chose rather he she knew would intermix grateful digressions and solve high dispute with conjugal caresses from his lip not words alone pleased her o when meet now such pairs in love and mutual honour joined with goddess-like demeanour forth she went not unattended for on her as queen a pomp of winning graces waited still and from about her shot darts of desire into all eyes to wish her still in sight and raphael now to adam's doubt proposed benevolent and facile thus replied to ask or search i blame thee not for heaven is as the book of god before thee set wherein to read his wonderous works and learn his seasons hours or days or months or years this to attain whether heaven move or earth imports not if thou reckon right the rest from man or angel the great architect did wisely to conceal and not divulge his secrets to be scanned by them who ought rather admire or if they list to try conjecture he his fabrick of the heavens hath left to their disputes perhaps to move his laughter at their quaint opinions wide hereafter when they come to model heaven and calculate the stars how they will wield the mighty frame how build unbuild contrive to save appearances how gird the sphere with centrick and eccentrick scribbled o'er cycle and epicycle orb in orb already by thy reasoning this i guess who art to lead thy offspring and supposest that bodies bright and greater should not serve the less not bright nor heaven such journeys run earth sitting still when she alone receives the benefit consider first that great or bright infers not excellence the earth though in comparison of heaven so small nor glistering may of solid good contain more plenty than the sun that barren shines whose virtue on itself works no effect but in the fruitful earth there first received his beams unactive else their vigour find yet not to earth are those bright luminaries officious but to thee earth's habitant and for the heaven's wide circuit let it speak the maker's high magnificence who built so spacious and his line stretched out so far that man may know he dwells not in his own an edifice too large for him to fill lodged in a small partition and the rest ordained for uses to his lord best known the swiftness of those circles attribute though numberless to his omnipotence that to corporeal substances could add speed almost spiritual me thou thinkest not slow who since the morning-hour set out from heaven where god resides and ere mid-day arrived in eden distance inexpressible by numbers that have name but this i urge admitting motion in the heavens to show invalid that which thee to doubt it moved not that i so affirm though so it seem to thee who hast thy dwelling here on earth god to remove his ways from human sense placed heaven from earth so far that earthly sight if it presume might err in things too high and no advantage gain what if the sun be center to the world and other stars by his attractive virtue and their own incited dance about him various rounds their wandering course now high now low then hid progressive retrograde or standing still in six thou seest and what if seventh to these the planet earth so stedfast though she seem insensibly three different motions move which else to several spheres thou must ascribe moved contrary with thwart obliquities or save the sun his labour and that swift nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed invisible else above all stars the wheel of day and night which needs not thy belief if earth industrious of herself fetch day travelling east and with her part averse from the sun's beam meet night her other part still luminous by his ray what if that light sent from her through the wide transpicuous air to the terrestrial moon be as a star enlightening her by day as she by night this earth reciprocal if land be there fields and inhabitants her spots thou seest as clouds and clouds may rain and rain produce fruits in her softened soil for some to eat allotted there and other suns perhaps with their attendant moons thou wilt descry communicating male and female light which two great sexes animate the world stored in each orb perhaps with some that live for such vast room in nature unpossessed by living soul desart and desolate only to shine yet scarce to contribute each orb a glimpse of light conveyed so far down to this habitable which returns light back to them is obvious to dispute but whether thus these things or whether not but whether the sun predominant in heaven rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun he from the east his flaming road begin or she from west her silent course advance with inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps on her soft axle while she paces even and bears thee soft with the smooth hair along sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid leave them to god above him serve and fear of other creatures as him pleases best wherever placed let him dispose joy thou in what he gives to thee this paradise and thy fair eve heaven is for thee too high to know what passes there be lowly wise think only what concerns thee and thy being dream not of other worlds what creatures there live in what state condition or degree contented that thus far hath been revealed not of earth only but of highest heaven to whom thus adam cleared of doubt replied how fully hast thou satisfied me pure intelligence of heaven angel serene and freed from intricacies taught to live the easiest way nor with perplexing thoughts to interrupt the sweet of life from which god hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares and not molest us unless we ourselves seek them with wandering thoughts and notions vain but apt the mind or fancy is to rove unchecked and of her roving is no end till warned or by experience taught she learn that not to know at large of things remote from use obscure and subtle but to know that which before us lies in daily life is the prime wisdom what is more is fume or emptiness or fond impertinence and renders us in things that most concern unpractised unprepared and still to seek therefore from this high pitch let us descend a lower flight and speak of things at hand useful whence haply mention may arise of something not unseasonable to ask by sufferance and thy wonted favour deigned thee i have heard relating what was done ere my remembrance now hear me relate my story which perhaps thou hast not heard and day is not yet spent till then thou seest how subtly to detain thee i devise inviting thee to hear while i relate fond were it not in hope of thy reply for while i sit with thee i seem in heaven and sweeter thy discourse is to my ear than fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst and hunger both from labour at the hour of sweet repast they satiate and soon fill though pleasant but thy words with grace divine imbued bring to their sweetness no satiety to whom thus raphael answered heavenly meek nor are thy lips ungraceful sire of men nor tongue ineloquent for god on thee abundantly his gifts hath also poured inward and outward both his image fair speaking or mute all comeliness and grace attends thee and each word each motion forms nor less think we in heaven of thee on earth than of our fellow-servant and inquire gladly into the ways of god with man for god we see hath honoured thee and set on man his equal love say therefore on for i that day was absent as befel bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure far on excursion toward the gates of hell squared in full legion such command we had to see that none thence issued forth a spy or enemy while god was in his work lest he incensed at such eruption bold destruction with creation might have mixed not that they durst without his leave attempt but us he sends upon his high behests for state as sovran king and to inure our prompt obedience fast we found fast shut the dismal gates and barricadoed strong but long ere our approaching heard within noise other than the sound of dance or song torment and loud lament and furious rage glad we returned up to the coasts of light ere sabbath-evening so we had in charge but thy relation now for i attend pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine so spake the godlike power and thus our sire for man to tell how human life began is hard for who himself beginning knew desire with thee still longer to converse induced me as new waked from soundest sleep soft on the flowery herb i found me laid in balmy sweat which with his beams the sun soon dried and on the reeking moisture fed straight toward heaven my wondering eyes i turned and gazed a while the ample sky till raised by quick instinctive motion up i sprung as thitherward endeavouring and upright stood on my feet about me round i saw hill dale and shady woods and sunny plains and liquid lapse of murmuring streams by these creatures that lived and moved and walked or flew birds on the branches warbling all things smiled with fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed myself i then perused and limb by limb surveyed and sometimes went and sometimes ran with supple joints as lively vigour led but who i was or where or from what cause knew not to speak i tried and forthwith spake my tongue obeyed and readily could name whate'er i saw thou sun said i fair light and thou enlightened earth so fresh and gay ye hills and dales ye rivers woods and plains and ye that live and move fair creatures tell tell if ye saw how i came thus how here -- not of myself -- by some great maker then in goodness and in power pre-eminent tell me how may i know him how adore from whom i have that thus i move and live and feel that i am happier than i know -- while thus i called and strayed i knew not whither from where i first drew air and first beheld this happy light when answer none returned on a green shady bank profuse of flowers pensive i sat me down there gentle sleep first found me and with soft oppression seised my droused sense untroubled though i thought i then was passing to my former state insensible and forthwith to dissolve when suddenly stood at my head a dream whose inward apparition gently moved my fancy to believe i yet had being and lived one came methought of shape divine and said 'thy mansion wants thee adam rise 'first man of men innumerable ordained 'first father called by thee i come thy guide 'to the garden of bliss thy seat prepared ' so saying by the hand he took me raised and over fields and waters as in air smooth-sliding without step last led me up a woody mountain whose high top was plain a circuit wide enclosed with goodliest trees planted with walks and bowers that what i saw of earth before scarce pleasant seemed each tree loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye tempting stirred in me sudden appetite to pluck and eat whereat i waked and found before mine eyes all real as the dream had lively shadowed here had new begun my wandering had not he who was my guide up hither from among the trees appeared presence divine rejoicing but with awe in adoration at his feet i fell submiss he reared me and 'whom thou soughtest i am ' said mildly 'author of all this thou seest 'above or round about thee or beneath 'this paradise i give thee count it thine 'to till and keep and of the fruit to eat 'of every tree that in the garden grows 'eat freely with glad heart fear here no dearth 'but of the tree whose operation brings 'knowledge of good and ill which i have set 'the pledge of thy obedience and thy faith 'amid the garden by the tree of life 'remember what i warn thee shun to taste 'and shun the bitter consequence for know 'the day thou eatest thereof my sole command 'transgressed inevitably thou shalt die 'from that day mortal and this happy state 'shalt lose expelled from hence into a world 'of woe and sorrow ' sternly he pronounced the rigid interdiction which resounds yet dreadful in mine ear though in my choice not to incur but soon his clear aspect returned and gracious purpose thus renewed 'not only these fair bounds but all the earth 'to thee and to thy race i give as lords 'possess it and all things that therein live 'or live in sea or air beast fish and fowl 'in sign whereof each bird and beast behold 'after their kinds i bring them to receive 'from thee their names and pay thee fealty 'with low subjection understand the same 'of fish within their watery residence 'not hither summoned since they cannot change 'their element to draw the thinner air ' as thus he spake each bird and beast behold approaching two and two these cowering low with blandishment each bird stooped on his wing i named them as they passed and understood their nature with such knowledge god endued my sudden apprehension but in these i found not what methought i wanted still and to the heavenly vision thus presumed o by what name for thou above all these above mankind or aught than mankind higher surpassest far my naming how may i adore thee author of this universe and all this good to man for whose well being so amply and with hands so liberal thou hast provided all things but with me i see not who partakes in solitude what happiness who can enjoy alone or all enjoying what contentment find thus i presumptuous and the vision bright as with a smile more brightened thus replied what callest thou solitude is not the earth with various living creatures and the air replenished and all these at thy command to come and play before thee knowest thou not their language and their ways they also know and reason not contemptibly with these find pastime and bear rule thy realm is large so spake the universal lord and seemed so ordering i with leave of speech implored and humble deprecation thus replied let not my words offend thee heavenly power my maker be propitious while i speak hast thou not made me here thy substitute and these inferiour far beneath me set among unequals what society can sort what harmony or true delight which must be mutual in proportion due given and received but in disparity the one intense the other still remiss cannot well suit with either but soon prove tedious alike of fellowship i speak such as i seek fit to participate all rational delight wherein the brute cannot be human consort they rejoice each with their kind lion with lioness so fitly them in pairs thou hast combined much less can bird with beast or fish with fowl so well converse nor with the ox the ape worse then can man with beast and least of all whereto the almighty answered not displeased a nice and subtle happiness i see thou to thyself proposest in the choice of thy associates adam and wilt taste no pleasure though in pleasure solitary what thinkest thou then of me and this my state seem i to thee sufficiently possessed of happiness or not who am alone from all eternity for none i know second to me or like equal much less how have i then with whom to hold converse save with the creatures which i made and those to me inferiour infinite descents beneath what other creatures are to thee he ceased i lowly answered to attain the highth and depth of thy eternal ways all human thoughts come short supreme of things thou in thyself art perfect and in thee is no deficience found not so is man but in degree the cause of his desire by conversation with his like to help or solace his defects no need that thou shouldst propagate already infinite and through all numbers absolute though one but man by number is to manifest his single imperfection and beget like of his like his image multiplied in unity defective which requires collateral love and dearest amity thou in thy secresy although alone best with thyself accompanied seekest not social communication yet so pleased canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt of union or communion deified i by conversing cannot these erect from prone nor in their ways complacence find thus i emboldened spake and freedom used permissive and acceptance found which gained this answer from the gracious voice divine thus far to try thee adam i was pleased and find thee knowing not of beasts alone which thou hast rightly named but of thyself expressing well the spirit within thee free my image not imparted to the brute whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike and be so minded still i ere thou spakest knew it not good for man to be alone and no such company as then thou sawest intended thee for trial only brought to see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet what next i bring shall please thee be assured thy likeness thy fit help thy other self thy wish exactly to thy heart's desire he ended or i heard no more for now my earthly by his heavenly overpowered which it had long stood under strained to the highth in that celestial colloquy sublime as with an object that excels the sense dazzled and spent sunk down and sought repair of sleep which instantly fell on me called by nature as in aid and closed mine eyes mine eyes he closed but open left the cell of fancy my internal sight by which abstract as in a trance methought i saw though sleeping where i lay and saw the shape still glorious before whom awake i stood who stooping opened my left side and took from thence a rib with cordial spirits warm and life-blood streaming fresh wide was the wound but suddenly with flesh filled up and healed the rib he formed and fashioned with his hands under his forming hands a creature grew man-like but different sex so lovely fair that what seemed fair in all the world seemed now mean or in her summed up in her contained and in her looks which from that time infused sweetness into my heart unfelt before and into all things from her air inspired the spirit of love and amorous delight she disappeared and left me dark i waked to find her or for ever to deplore her loss and other pleasures all abjure when out of hope behold her not far off such as i saw her in my dream adorned with what all earth or heaven could bestow to make her amiable on she came led by her heavenly maker though unseen and guided by his voice nor uninformed of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites grace was in all her steps heaven in her eye in every gesture dignity and love i overjoyed could not forbear aloud this turn hath made amends thou hast fulfilled thy words creator bounteous and benign giver of all things fair but fairest this of all thy gifts nor enviest i now see bone of my bone flesh of my flesh myself before me woman is her name of man extracted for this cause he shall forego father and mother and to his wife adhere and they shall be one flesh one heart one soul she heard me thus and though divinely brought yet innocence and virgin modesty her virtue and the conscience of her worth that would be wooed and not unsought be won not obvious not obtrusive but retired the more desirable or to say all nature herself though pure of sinful thought wrought in her so that seeing me she turned i followed her she what was honour knew and with obsequious majesty approved my pleaded reason to the nuptial bower i led her blushing like the morn all heaven and happy constellations on that hour shed their selectest influence the earth gave sign of gratulation and each hill joyous the birds fresh gales and gentle airs whispered it to the woods and from their wings flung rose flung odours from the spicy shrub disporting till the amorous bird of night sung spousal and bid haste the evening-star on his hill top to light the bridal lamp thus have i told thee all my state and brought my story to the sum of earthly bliss which i enjoy and must confess to find in all things else delight indeed but such as used or not works in the mind no change nor vehement desire these delicacies i mean of taste sight smell herbs fruits and flowers walks and the melody of birds but here far otherwise transported i behold transported touch here passion first i felt commotion strange in all enjoyments else superiour and unmoved here only weak against the charm of beauty's powerful glance or nature failed in me and left some part not proof enough such object to sustain or from my side subducting took perhaps more than enough at least on her bestowed too much of ornament in outward show elaborate of inward less exact for well i understand in the prime end of nature her the inferiour in the mind and inward faculties which most excel in outward also her resembling less his image who made both and less expressing the character of that dominion given o'er other creatures yet when i approach her loveliness so absolute she seems and in herself complete so well to know her own that what she wills to do or say seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best all higher knowledge in her presence falls degraded wisdom in discourse with her loses discountenanced and like folly shows authority and reason on her wait as one intended first not after made occasionally and to consummate all greatness of mind and nobleness their seat build in her loveliest and create an awe about her as a guard angelick placed to whom the angel with contracted brow accuse not nature she hath done her part do thou but thine and be not diffident of wisdom she deserts thee not if thou dismiss not her when most thou needest her nigh by attributing overmuch to things less excellent as thou thyself perceivest for what admirest thou what transports thee so an outside fair no doubt and worthy well thy cherishing thy honouring and thy love not thy subjection weigh with her thyself then value oft-times nothing profits more than self-esteem grounded on just and right well managed of that skill the more thou knowest the more she will acknowledge thee her head and to realities yield all her shows made so adorn for thy delight the more so awful that with honour thou mayest love thy mate who sees when thou art seen least wise but if the sense of touch whereby mankind is propagated seem such dear delight beyond all other think the same vouchsafed to cattle and each beast which would not be to them made common and divulged if aught therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue the soul of man or passion in him move what higher in her society thou findest attractive human rational love still in loving thou dost well in passion not wherein true love consists not love refines the thoughts and heart enlarges hath his seat in reason and is judicious is the scale by which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend not sunk in carnal pleasure for which cause among the beasts no mate for thee was found to whom thus half abashed adam replied neither her outside formed so fair nor aught in procreation common to all kinds though higher of the genial bed by far and with mysterious reverence i deem so much delights me as those graceful acts those thousand decencies that daily flow from all her words and actions mixed with love and sweet compliance which declare unfeigned union of mind or in us both one soul harmony to behold in wedded pair more grateful than harmonious sound to the ear yet these subject not i to thee disclose what inward thence i feel not therefore foiled who meet with various objects from the sense variously representing yet still free approve the best and follow what i approve to love thou blamest me not for love thou sayest leads up to heaven is both the way and guide bear with me then if lawful what i ask love not the heavenly spirits and how their love express they by looks only or do they mix irradiance virtual or immediate touch to whom the angel with a smile that glowed celestial rosy red love's proper hue answered let it suffice thee that thou knowest us happy and without love no happiness whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest and pure thou wert created we enjoy in eminence and obstacle find none of membrane joint or limb exclusive bars easier than air with air if spirits embrace total they mix union of pure with pure desiring nor restrained conveyance need as flesh to mix with flesh or soul with soul but i can now no more the parting sun beyond the earth's green cape and verdant isles hesperian sets my signal to depart be strong live happy and love but first of all him whom to love is to obey and keep his great command take heed lest passion sway thy judgement to do aught which else free will would not admit thine and of all thy sons the weal or woe in thee is placed beware i in thy persevering shall rejoice and all the blest stand fast to stand or fall free in thine own arbitrement it lies perfect within no outward aid require and all temptation to transgress repel so saying he arose whom adam thus followed with benediction since to part go heavenly guest ethereal messenger sent from whose sovran goodness i adore gentle to me and affable hath been thy condescension and shall be honoured ever with grateful memory thou to mankind be good and friendly still and oft return so parted they the angel up to heaven from the thick shade and adam to his bower book ix no more of talk where god or angel guest with man as with his friend familiar us'd to sit indulgent and with him partake rural repast permitting him the while venial discourse unblam'd i now must change those notes to tragick foul distrust and breach disloyal on the part of man revolt and disobedience on the part of heaven now alienated distance and distaste anger and just rebuke and judgement given that brought into this world a world of woe sin and her shadow death and misery death's harbinger sad talk yet argument not less but more heroick than the wrath of stern achilles on his foe pursued thrice fugitive about troy wall or rage of turnus for lavinia disespous'd or neptune's ire or juno's that so long perplexed the greek and cytherea's son 00482129 if answerable style i can obtain of my celestial patroness who deigns her nightly visitation unimplor'd and dictates to me slumbering or inspires easy my unpremeditated verse since first this subject for heroick song pleas'd me long choosing and beginning late not sedulous by nature to indite wars hitherto the only argument heroick deem'd chief mastery to dissect with long and tedious havock fabled knights in battles feign'd the better fortitude of patience and heroick martyrdom unsung or to describe races and games or tilting furniture imblazon'd shields impresses quaint caparisons and steeds bases and tinsel trappings gorgeous knights at joust and tournament then marshall'd feast serv'd up in hall with sewers and seneshals the skill of artifice or office mean not that which justly gives heroick name to person or to poem me of these nor skill'd nor studious higher argument remains sufficient of itself to raise that name unless an age too late or cold climate or years damp my intended wing depress'd and much they may if all be mine not hers who brings it nightly to my ear the sun was sunk and after him the star of hesperus whose office is to bring twilight upon the earth short arbiter twixt day and night and now from end to end night's hemisphere had veil'd the horizon round when satan who late fled before the threats of gabriel out of eden now improv'd in meditated fraud and malice bent on man's destruction maugre what might hap of heavier on himself fearless returned from compassing the earth cautious of day since uriel regent of the sun descried his entrance and foreworned the cherubim that kept their watch thence full of anguish driven the space of seven continued nights he rode with darkness thrice the equinoctial line he circled four times crossed the car of night from pole to pole traversing each colure on the eighth returned and on the coast averse from entrance or cherubick watch by stealth found unsuspected way there was a place now not though sin not time first wrought the change where tigris at the foot of paradise into a gulf shot under ground till part rose up a fountain by the tree of life in with the river sunk and with it rose satan involved in rising mist then sought where to lie hid sea he had searched and land from eden over pontus and the pool maeotis up beyond the river ob downward as far antarctick and in length west from orontes to the ocean barred at darien thence to the land where flows ganges and indus thus the orb he roamed with narrow search and with inspection deep considered every creature which of all most opportune might serve his wiles and found the serpent subtlest beast of all the field him after long debate irresolute of thoughts revolved his final sentence chose fit vessel fittest imp of fraud in whom to enter and his dark suggestions hide from sharpest sight for in the wily snake whatever sleights none would suspicious mark as from his wit and native subtlety proceeding which in other beasts observed doubt might beget of diabolick power active within beyond the sense of brute thus he resolved but first from inward grief his bursting passion into plaints thus poured more justly seat worthier of gods as built with second thoughts reforming what was old o earth how like to heaven if not preferred for what god after better worse would build terrestrial heaven danced round by other heavens that shine yet bear their bright officious lamps light above light for thee alone as seems in thee concentring all their precious beams of sacred influence as god in heaven is center yet extends to all so thou centring receivest from all those orbs in thee not in themselves all their known virtue appears productive in herb plant and nobler birth of creatures animate with gradual life of growth sense reason all summed up in man with what delight could i have walked thee round if i could joy in aught sweet interchange of hill and valley rivers woods and plains now land now sea and shores with forest crowned rocks dens and caves but i in none of these find place or refuge and the more i see pleasures about me so much more i feel torment within me as from the hateful siege of contraries all good to me becomes bane and in heaven much worse would be my state but neither here seek i no nor in heaven to dwell unless by mastering heaven's supreme nor hope to be myself less miserable by what i seek but others to make such as i though thereby worse to me redound for only in destroying i find ease to my relentless thoughts and him destroyed or won to what may work his utter loss for whom all this was made all this will soon follow as to him linked in weal or woe in woe then that destruction wide may range to me shall be the glory sole among the infernal powers in one day to have marred what he almighty styled six nights and days continued making and who knows how long before had been contriving though perhaps not longer than since i in one night freed from servitude inglorious well nigh half the angelick name and thinner left the throng of his adorers he to be avenged and to repair his numbers thus impaired whether such virtue spent of old now failed more angels to create if they at least are his created or to spite us more determined to advance into our room a creature formed of earth and him endow exalted from so base original with heavenly spoils our spoils what he decreed he effected man he made and for him built magnificent this world and earth his seat him lord pronounced and o indignity subjected to his service angel-wings and

find the serpent sleeping in whose mazy folds to hide me and the dark intent i bring o foul descent that i who erst contended with gods to sit the highest am now constrained into a beast and mixed with bestial slime this essence to incarnate and imbrute that to the highth of deity aspired but what will not ambition and revenge descend to who aspires must down as low as high he soared obnoxious first or last to basest things revenge at first though sweet bitter ere long back on itself recoils let it i reck not so it light well aimed since higher i fall short on him who next provokes my envy this new favourite of heaven this man of clay son of despite whom us the more to spite his maker raised from dust spite then with spite is best repaid so saying through each thicket dank or dry like a black mist low-creeping he held on his midnight-search where soonest he might find the serpent him fast-sleeping soon he found in labyrinth of many a round self-rolled his head the midst well stored with subtile wiles not yet in horrid shade or dismal den nor nocent yet but on the grassy herb fearless unfeared he slept in at his mouth the devil entered and his brutal sense in heart or head possessing soon inspired with act intelligential but his sleep disturbed not waiting close the approach of morn now when as sacred light began to dawn in eden on the humid flowers that breathed their morning incense when all things that breathe from the earth's great altar send up silent praise to the creator and his nostrils fill with grateful smell forth came the human pair and joined their vocal worship to the quire of creatures wanting voice that done partake the season prime for sweetest scents and airs then commune how that day they best may ply their growing work for much their work out-grew the hands' dispatch of two gardening so wide and eve first to her husband thus began adam well may we labour still to dress this garden still to tend plant herb and flower our pleasant task enjoined but till more hands aid us the work under our labour grows luxurious by restraint what we by day lop overgrown or prune or prop or bind one night or two with wanton growth derides tending to wild thou therefore now advise or bear what to my mind first thoughts present let us divide our labours thou where choice leads thee or where most needs whether to wind the woodbine round this arbour or direct the clasping ivy where to climb while i in yonder spring of roses intermixed with myrtle find what to redress till noon for while so near each other thus all day our task we choose what wonder if so near looks intervene and smiles or object new casual discourse draw on which intermits our day's work brought to little though begun early and the hour of supper comes unearned to whom mild answer adam thus returned sole eve associate sole to me beyond compare above all living creatures dear well hast thou motioned well thy thoughts employed how we might best fulfil the work which here god hath assigned us nor of me shalt pass unpraised for nothing lovelier can be found in woman than to study houshold good and good works in her husband to promote yet not so strictly hath our lord imposed labour as to debar us when we need refreshment whether food or talk between food of the mind or this sweet intercourse of looks and smiles for smiles from reason flow to brute denied and are of love the food love not the lowest end of human life for not to irksome toil but to delight he made us and delight to reason joined these paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands will keep from wilderness with ease as wide as we need walk till younger hands ere long assist us but if much converse perhaps thee satiate to short absence i could yield for solitude sometimes is best society and short retirement urges sweet return but other doubt possesses me lest harm befall thee severed from me for thou knowest what hath been warned us what malicious foe envying our happiness and of his own despairing seeks to work us woe and shame by sly assault and somewhere nigh at hand watches no doubt with greedy hope to find his wish and best advantage us asunder hopeless to circumvent us joined where each to other speedy aid might lend at need whether his first design be to withdraw our fealty from god or to disturb conjugal love than which perhaps no bliss enjoyed by us excites his envy more or this or worse leave not the faithful side that gave thee being still shades thee and protects the wife where danger or dishonour lurks safest and seemliest by her husband stays who guards her or with her the worst endures to whom the virgin majesty of eve as one who loves and some unkindness meets with sweet austere composure thus replied offspring of heaven and earth and all earth's lord that such an enemy we have who seeks our ruin both by thee informed i learn and from the parting angel over-heard as in a shady nook i stood behind just then returned at shut of evening flowers but that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt to god or thee because we have a foe may tempt it i expected not to hear his violence thou fearest not being such as we not capable of death or pain can either not receive or can repel his fraud is then thy fear which plain infers thy equal fear that my firm faith and love can by his fraud be shaken or seduced thoughts which how found they harbour in thy breast adam mis-thought of her to thee so dear to whom with healing words adam replied daughter of god and man immortal eve for such thou art from sin and blame entire not diffident of thee do i dissuade thy absence from my sight but to avoid the attempt itself intended by our foe for he who tempts though in vain at least asperses the tempted with dishonour foul supposed not incorruptible of faith not proof against temptation thou thyself with scorn and anger wouldst resent the offered wrong though ineffectual found misdeem not then if such affront i labour to avert from thee alone which on us both at once the enemy though bold will hardly dare or daring first on me the assault shall light nor thou his malice and false guile contemn subtle he needs must be who could seduce angels nor think superfluous other's aid i from the influence of thy looks receive access in every virtue in thy sight more wise more watchful stronger if need were of outward strength while shame thou looking on shame to be overcome or over-reached would utmost vigour raise and raised unite why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel when i am present and thy trial choose with me best witness of thy virtue tried so spake domestick adam in his care and matrimonial love but eve who thought less attributed to her faith sincere thus her reply with accent sweet renewed if this be our condition thus to dwell in narrow circuit straitened by a foe subtle or violent we not endued single with like defence wherever met how are we happy still in fear of harm but harm precedes not sin only our foe tempting affronts us with his foul esteem of our integrity his foul esteem sticks no dishonour on our front but turns foul on himself then wherefore shunned or feared by us who rather double honour gain from his surmise proved false find peace within favour from heaven our witness from the event and what is faith love virtue unassayed alone without exteriour help sustained let us not then suspect our happy state left so imperfect by the maker wise as not secure to single or combined frail is our happiness if this be so and eden were no eden thus exposed to whom thus adam fervently replied o woman best are all things as the will of god ordained them his creating hand nothing imperfect or deficient left of all that he created much less man or aught that might his happy state secure secure from outward force within himself the danger lies yet lies within his power against his will he can receive no harm but god left free the will for what obeys reason is free and reason he made right but bid her well be ware and still erect lest by some fair-appearing good surprised she dictate false and mis-inform the will to do what god expressly hath forbid not then mistrust but tender love enjoins that i should mind thee oft and mind thou me firm we subsist yet possible to swerve since reason not impossibly may meet some specious object by the foe suborned and fall into deception unaware not keeping strictest watch as she was warned seek not temptation then which to avoid were better and most likely if from me thou sever not trial will come unsought wouldst thou approve thy constancy approve first thy obedience the other who can know not seeing thee attempted who attest but if thou think trial unsought may find us both securer than thus warned thou seemest go for thy stay not free absents thee more go in thy native innocence rely on what thou hast of virtue summon all for god towards thee hath done his part do thine so spake the patriarch of mankind but eve persisted yet submiss though last replied with thy permission then and thus forewarned chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words touched only that our trial when least sought may find us both perhaps far less prepared the willinger i go nor much expect a foe so proud will first the weaker seek so bent the more shall shame him his repulse thus saying from her husband's hand her hand soft she withdrew and like a wood-nymph light oread or dryad or of delia's train betook her to the groves but delia's self in gait surpassed and goddess-like deport though not as she with bow and quiver armed but with such gardening tools as art yet rude guiltless of fire had formed or angels brought to pales or pomona thus adorned likest she seemed pomona when she fled vertumnus or to ceres in her prime yet virgin of proserpina from jove her long with ardent look his eye pursued delighted but desiring more her stay oft he to her his charge of quick return repeated she to him as oft engaged to be returned by noon amid the bower and all things in best order to invite noontide repast or afternoon's repose o much deceived much failing hapless eve of thy presumed return event perverse thou never from that hour in paradise foundst either sweet repast or sound repose such ambush hid among sweet flowers and shades waited with hellish rancour imminent to intercept thy way or send thee back despoiled of innocence of faith of bliss for now and since first break of dawn the fiend mere serpent in appearance forth was come and on his quest where likeliest he might find the only two of mankind but in them the whole included race his purposed prey in bower and field he sought where any tuft of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay their tendance or plantation for delight by fountain or by shady rivulet he sought them both but wished his hap might find eve separate he wished but not with hope of what so seldom chanced when to his wish beyond his hope eve separate he spies veiled in a cloud of fragrance where she stood half spied so thick the roses blushing round about her glowed oft stooping to support each flower of slender stalk whose head though gay carnation purple azure or specked with gold hung drooping unsustained them she upstays gently with myrtle band mindless the while herself though fairest unsupported flower from her best prop so far and storm so nigh nearer he drew and many a walk traversed of stateliest covert cedar pine or palm then voluble and bold now hid now seen among thick-woven arborets and flowers imbordered on each bank the hand of eve spot more delicious than those gardens feigned or of revived adonis or renowned alcinous host of old laertes' son or that not mystick where the sapient king held dalliance with his fair egyptian spouse much he the place admired the person more as one who long in populous city pent where houses thick and sewers annoy the air forth issuing on a summer's morn to breathe among the pleasant villages and farms adjoined from each thing met conceives delight the smell of grain or tedded grass or kine or dairy each rural sight each rural sound if chance with nymph-like step fair virgin pass what pleasing seemed for her now pleases more she most and in her look sums all delight such pleasure took the serpent to behold this flowery plat the sweet recess of eve thus early thus alone her heavenly form angelick but more soft and feminine her graceful innocence her every air of gesture or least action overawed his malice and with rapine sweet bereaved his fierceness of the fierce intent it brought that space the evil-one abstracted stood from his own evil and for the time remained stupidly good of enmity disarmed of guile of hate of envy of revenge but the hot hell that always in him burns though in mid heaven soon ended his delight and tortures him now more the more he sees of pleasure not for him ordained then soon fierce hate he recollects and all his thoughts of mischief gratulating thus excites thoughts whither have ye led me with what sweet compulsion thus transported to forget what hither brought us hate not love nor hope of paradise for hell hope here to taste of pleasure but all pleasure to destroy save what is in destroying other joy to me is lost then let me not let pass occasion which now smiles behold alone the woman opportune to all attempts her husband for i view far round not nigh whose higher intellectual more i shun and strength of courage haughty and of limb heroick built though of terrestrial mould foe not informidable exempt from wound i not so much hath hell debased and pain enfeebled me to what i was in heaven she fair divinely fair fit love for gods not terrible though terrour be in love and beauty not approached by stronger hate hate stronger under show of love well feigned the way which to her ruin now i tend so spake the enemy of mankind enclosed in serpent inmate bad and toward eve addressed his way not with indented wave prone on the ground as since but on his rear circular base of rising folds that towered fold above fold a surging maze his head crested aloft and carbuncle his eyes with burnished neck of verdant gold erect amidst his circling spires that on the grass floated redundant pleasing was his shape and lovely never since of serpent-kind lovelier not those that in illyria changed hermione and cadmus or the god in epidaurus nor to which transformed ammonian jove or capitoline was seen he with olympias this with her who bore scipio the highth of rome with tract oblique at first as one who sought access but feared to interrupt side-long he works his way as when a ship by skilful steersmen wrought nigh river's mouth or foreland where the wind veers oft as oft so steers and shifts her sail so varied he and of his tortuous train curled many a wanton wreath in sight of eve to lure her eye she busied heard the sound of rusling leaves but minded not as used to such disport before her through the field from every beast more duteous at her call than at circean call the herd disguised he bolder now uncalled before her stood but as in gaze admiring oft he bowed his turret crest and sleek enamelled neck fawning and licked the ground whereon she trod his gentle dumb expression turned at length the eye of eve to mark his play he glad of her attention gained with serpent-tongue organick or impulse of vocal air his fraudulent temptation thus began wonder not sovran mistress if perhaps thou canst who art sole wonder much less arm thy looks the heaven of mildness with disdain displeased that i approach thee thus and gaze insatiate i thus single nor have feared thy awful brow more awful thus retired fairest resemblance of thy maker fair thee all things living gaze on all things thine by gift and thy celestial beauty adore with ravishment beheld there best beheld where universally admired but here in this enclosure wild these beasts among beholders rude and shallow to discern half what in thee is fair one man except who sees thee and what is one who should be seen a goddess among gods adored and served by angels numberless thy daily train so glozed the tempter and his proem tuned into the heart of eve his words made way though at the voice much marvelling at length not unamazed she thus in answer spake what may this mean language of man pronounced by tongue of brute and human sense expressed the first at least of these i thought denied to beasts whom god on their creation-day created mute to all articulate sound the latter i demur for in their looks much reason and in their actions oft appears thee serpent subtlest beast of all the field i knew but not with human voice endued redouble then this miracle and say how camest thou speakable of mute and how to me so friendly grown above the rest of brutal kind that daily are in sight say for such wonder claims attention due to whom the guileful tempter thus replied empress of this fair world resplendent eve easy to me it is to tell thee all what thou commandest and right thou shouldst be obeyed i was at first as other beasts that graze the trodden herb of abject thoughts and low as was my food nor aught but food discerned or sex and apprehended nothing high till on a day roving the field i chanced a goodly tree far distant to behold loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed ruddy and gold i nearer drew to gaze when from the boughs a savoury odour blown grateful to appetite more pleased my sense than smell of sweetest fennel or the teats of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even unsucked of lamb or kid that tend their play to satisfy the sharp desire i had of tasting those fair apples i resolved not to defer hunger and thirst at once powerful persuaders quickened at the scent of that alluring fruit urged me so keen about the mossy trunk i wound me soon for high from ground the branches would require thy utmost reach or adam's round the tree all other beasts that saw with like desire longing and envying stood but could not reach amid the tree now got where plenty hung tempting so nigh to pluck and eat my fill i spared not for such pleasure till that hour at feed or fountain never had i found sated at length ere long i might perceive strange alteration in me to degree of reason in my inward powers and speech wanted not long though to this shape retained thenceforth to speculations high or deep i turned my thoughts and with capacious mind considered all things visible in heaven or earth or middle all things fair and good but all that fair and good in thy divine semblance and in thy beauty's heavenly ray united i beheld no fair to thine equivalent or second which compelled me thus though importune perhaps to come and gaze and worship thee of right declared sovran of creatures universal dame so talked the spirited sly snake and eve yet more amazed unwary thus replied serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt the virtue of that fruit in thee first proved but say where grows the tree from hence how far for many are the trees of god that grow in paradise and various yet unknown to us in such abundance lies our choice as leaves a greater store of fruit untouched still hanging incorruptible till men grow up to their provision and more hands help to disburden nature of her birth to whom the wily adder blithe and glad empress the way is ready and not long beyond a row of myrtles on a flat fast by a fountain one small thicket past of blowing myrrh and balm if thou accept my conduct i can bring thee thither soon lead then said eve he leading swiftly rolled in tangles and made intricate seem straight to mischief swift hope elevates and joy brightens his crest as when a wandering fire compact of unctuous vapour which the night condenses and the cold environs round kindled through agitation to a flame which oft they say some evil spirit attends hovering and blazing with delusive light misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way to bogs and mires and oft through pond or pool there swallowed up and lost from succour far so glistered the dire snake and into fraud led eve our credulous mother to the tree of prohibition root of all our woe which when she saw thus to her guide she spake serpent we might have spared our coming hither fruitless to me though fruit be here to excess the credit of whose virtue rest with thee wonderous indeed if cause of such effects but of this tree we may not taste nor touch god so commanded and left that command sole daughter of his voice the rest we live law to ourselves our reason is our law to whom the tempter guilefully replied indeed hath god then said that of the fruit of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat yet lords declared of all in earth or air to whom thus eve yet sinless of the fruit of each tree in the garden we may eat but of the fruit of this fair tree amidst the garden god hath said ye shall not eat thereof nor shall ye touch it lest ye die she scarce had said though brief when now more bold the tempter but with show of zeal and love to man and indignation at his wrong new part puts on and as to passion moved fluctuates disturbed yet comely and in act raised as of some great matter to begin as when of old some orator renowned in athens or free rome where eloquence flourished since mute to some great cause addressed stood in himself collected while each part motion each act won audience ere the tongue sometimes in highth began as no delay of preface brooking through his zeal of right so standing moving or to highth up grown the tempter all impassioned thus began o sacred wise and wisdom-giving plant mother of science now i feel thy power within me clear not only to discern things in their causes but to trace the ways of highest agents deemed however wise queen of this universe do not believe those rigid threats of death ye shall not die how should you by the fruit it gives you life to knowledge by the threatener look on me me who have touched and tasted yet both live and life more perfect have attained than fate meant me by venturing higher than my lot shall that be shut to man which to the beast is open or will god incense his ire for such a petty trespass and not praise rather your dauntless virtue whom the pain of death denounced whatever thing death be deterred not from achieving what might lead to happier life knowledge of good and evil of good how just of evil if what is evil be real why not known since easier shunned god therefore cannot hurt ye and be just not just not god not feared then nor obeyed your fear itself of death removes the fear why then was this forbid why but to awe why but to keep ye low and ignorant his worshippers he knows that in the day ye eat thereof your eyes that seem so clear yet are but dim shall perfectly be then opened and cleared and ye shall be as gods knowing both good and evil as they know that ye shall be as gods since i as man internal man is but proportion meet i of brute human ye of human gods so ye shall die perhaps by putting off human to put on gods death to be wished though threatened which no worse than this can bring and what are gods that man may not become as they participating god-like food the gods are first and that advantage use on our belief that all from them proceeds i question it for this fair earth i see warmed by the sun producing every kind them nothing if they all things who enclosed knowledge of good and evil in this tree that whoso eats thereof forthwith attains wisdom without their leave and wherein lies the offence that man should thus attain to know what can your knowledge hurt him or this tree impart against his will if all be his or is it envy and can envy dwell in heavenly breasts these these and many more causes import your need of this fair fruit goddess humane reach then and freely taste he ended and his words replete with guile into her heart too easy entrance won fixed on the fruit she gazed which to behold might tempt alone and in her ears the sound yet rung of his persuasive words impregned with reason to her seeming and with truth mean while the hour of noon drew on and waked an eager appetite raised by the smell so savoury of that fruit which with desire inclinable now grown to touch or taste solicited her longing eye yet first pausing a while thus to herself she mused great are thy virtues doubtless best of fruits though kept from man and worthy to be admired whose taste too long forborn at first assay gave elocution to the mute and taught the tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise thy praise he also who forbids thy use conceals not from us naming thee the tree of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil forbids us then to taste but his forbidding commends thee more while it infers the good by thee communicated and our want for good unknown sure is not had or had and yet unknown is as not had at all in plain then what forbids he but to know forbids us good forbids us to be wise such prohibitions bind not but if death bind us with after-bands what profits then our inward freedom in the day we eat of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die how dies the serpent he hath eaten and lives and knows and speaks and reasons and discerns irrational till then for us alone was death invented or to us denied this intellectual food for beasts reserved for beasts it seems yet that one beast which first hath tasted envies not but brings with joy the good befallen him author unsuspect friendly to man far from deceit or guile what fear i then rather what know to fear under this ignorance of good and evil of god or death of law or penalty here grows the cure of all this fruit divine fair to the eye inviting to the taste of virtue to make wise what hinders then to reach and feed at once both body and mind so saying her rash hand in evil hour forth reaching to the fruit she plucked she eat earth felt the wound and nature from her seat sighing through all her works gave signs of woe that all was lost back to the thicket slunk the guilty serpent and well might for eve intent now wholly on her taste nought else regarded such delight till then as seemed in fruit she never tasted whether true or fancied so through expectation high of knowledge not was godhead from her thought greedily she ingorged without restraint and knew not eating death satiate at length and hightened as with wine jocund and boon thus to herself she pleasingly began o sovran virtuous precious of all trees in paradise of operation blest to sapience hitherto obscured infamed and thy fair fruit let hang as to no end created but henceforth my early care not without song each morning and due praise shall tend thee and the fertile burden ease of thy full branches offered free to all till dieted by thee i grow mature in knowledge as the gods who all things know though others envy what they cannot give for had the gift been theirs it had not here thus grown experience next to thee i owe best guide not following thee i had remained in ignorance thou openest wisdom's way and givest access though secret she retire and i perhaps am secret heaven is high high and remote to see from thence distinct each thing on earth and other care perhaps may have diverted from continual watch our great forbidder safe with all his spies about him but to adam in what sort shall i appear shall i to him make known as yet my change and give him to partake full happiness with me or rather not but keeps the odds of knowledge in my power without copartner so to add what wants in female sex the more to draw his love and render me more equal and perhaps a thing not undesirable sometime superiour for inferiour who is free this may be well but what if god have seen and death ensue then i shall be no more and adam wedded to another eve shall live with her enjoying i extinct a death to think confirmed then i resolve adam shall share with me in bliss or woe so dear i love him that with him all deaths i could endure without him live no life so saying from the tree her step she turned but first low reverence done as to the power that dwelt within whose presence had infused into the plant sciential sap derived from nectar drink of gods adam the while waiting desirous her return had wove of choicest flowers a garland to adorn her tresses and her rural labours crown as reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen great joy he promised to his thoughts and new solace in her return so long delayed yet oft his heart divine of something ill misgave him he the faltering measure felt and forth to meet her went the way she took that morn when first they parted by the tree of knowledge he must pass there he her met scarce from the tree returning in her hand a bough of fairest fruit that downy smiled new gathered and ambrosial smell diffused to him she hasted in her face excuse came prologue and apology too prompt which with bland words at will she thus addressed hast thou not wondered adam at my stay thee i have missed and thought it long deprived thy presence agony of love till now not felt nor shall be twice for never more mean i to try what rash untried i sought the pain of absence from thy sight but strange hath been the cause and wonderful to hear this tree is not as we are told a tree of danger tasted nor to evil unknown opening the way but of divine effect to open eyes and make them gods who taste and hath been tasted such the serpent wise or not restrained as we or not obeying hath eaten of the fruit and is become not dead as we are threatened but thenceforth endued with human voice and human sense reasoning to admiration and with me persuasively hath so prevailed that i have also tasted and have also found the effects to correspond opener mine eyes dim erst dilated spirits ampler heart and growing up to godhead which for thee chiefly i sought without thee can despise for bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss tedious unshared with thee and odious soon thou therefore also taste that equal lot may join us equal joy as equal love lest thou not tasting different degree disjoin us and i then too late renounce deity for thee when fate will not permit thus eve with countenance blithe her story told but in her cheek distemper flushing glowed on the other side adam soon as he heard the fatal trespass done by eve amazed astonied stood and blank while horrour chill ran through his veins and all his joints relaxed from his slack hand the garland wreathed for eve down dropt and all the faded roses shed speechless he stood and pale till thus at length first to himself he inward silence broke o fairest of creation last and best of all god's works creature in whom excelled whatever can to sight or thought be formed holy divine good amiable or sweet how art thou lost how on a sudden lost defaced deflowered and now to death devote rather how hast thou yielded to transgress the strict forbiddance how to violate the sacred fruit forbidden some cursed fraud of enemy hath beguiled thee yet unknown and me with thee hath ruined for with thee certain my resolution is to die how can i live without thee how forego thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined to live again in these wild woods forlorn should god create another eve and i another rib afford yet loss of thee would never from my heart no no i feel the link of nature draw me flesh of flesh bone of my bone thou art and from thy state mine never shall be parted bliss or woe so having said as one from sad dismay recomforted and after thoughts disturbed submitting to what seemed remediless thus in calm mood his words to eve he turned bold deed thou hast presumed adventurous eve and peril great provoked who thus hast dared had it been only coveting to eye that sacred fruit sacred to abstinence much more to taste it under ban to touch but past who can recall or done undo not god omnipotent nor fate yet so perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact is not so heinous now foretasted fruit profaned first by the serpent by him first made common and unhallowed ere our taste nor yet on him found deadly yet he lives lives as thou saidst and gains to live as man higher degree of life inducement strong to us as likely tasting to attain proportional ascent which cannot be but to be gods or angels demi-gods nor can i think that god creator wise though threatening will in earnest so destroy us his prime creatures dignified so high set over all his works which in our fall for us created needs with us must fail dependant made so god shall uncreate be frustrate do undo and labour lose not well conceived of god who though his power creation could repeat yet would be loth us to abolish lest the adversary triumph and say fickle their state whom god most favours who can please him long me first he ruined now mankind whom will he next matter of scorn not to be given the foe however i with thee have fixed my lot certain to undergo like doom if death consort with thee death is to me as life so forcible within my heart i feel the bond of nature draw me to my own my own in thee for what thou art is mine our state cannot be severed we are one one flesh to lose thee were to lose myself so adam and thus eve to him replied o glorious trial of exceeding love illustrious evidence example high engaging me to emulate but short of thy perfection how shall i attain adam from whose dear side i boast me sprung and gladly of our union hear thee speak one heart one soul in both whereof good proof this day affords declaring thee resolved rather than death or aught than death more dread shall separate us linked in love so dear to undergo with me one guilt one crime if any be of tasting this fair fruit whose virtue for of good still good proceeds direct or by occasion hath presented this happy trial of thy love which else so eminently never had been known were it i thought death menaced would ensue this my attempt i would sustain alone the worst and not persuade thee rather die deserted than oblige thee with a fact pernicious to thy peace chiefly assured remarkably so late of thy so true so faithful love unequalled but i feel far otherwise the event not death but life augmented opened eyes new hopes new joys taste so divine that what of sweet before hath touched my sense flat seems to this and harsh on my experience adam freely taste and fear of death deliver to the winds so saying she embraced him and for joy tenderly wept much won that he his love had so ennobled as of choice to incur divine displeasure for her sake or death in recompence for such compliance bad such recompence best merits from the bough she gave him of that fair enticing fruit with liberal hand he scrupled not to eat against his better knowledge not deceived but fondly overcome with female charm earth trembled from her entrails as again in pangs and nature gave a second groan sky loured and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completing of the mortal sin original while adam took no thought eating his fill nor eve to iterate her former trespass feared the more to sooth him with her loved society that now as with new wine intoxicated both they swim in mirth and fancy that they feel divinity within them breeding wings wherewith to scorn the earth but that false fruit far other operation first displayed carnal desire inflaming he on eve began to cast lascivious eyes she him as wantonly repaid in lust they burn till adam thus 'gan eve to dalliance move eve now i see thou art exact of taste and elegant of sapience no small part since to each meaning savour we apply and palate call judicious i the praise yield thee so well this day thou hast purveyed much pleasure we have lost while we abstained from this delightful fruit nor known till now true relish tasting if such pleasure be in things to us forbidden it might be wished for this one tree had been forbidden ten but come so well refreshed now let us play as meet is after such delicious fare for never did thy beauty since the day i saw thee first and wedded thee adorned with all perfections so inflame my sense with ardour to enjoy thee fairer now than ever bounty of this virtuous tree so said he and forbore not glance or toy of amorous intent well understood of eve whose eye darted contagious fire her hand he seised and to a shady bank thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered he led her nothing loth flowers were the couch pansies and violets and asphodel and hyacinth earth's freshest softest lap there they their fill of love and love's disport took largely of their mutual guilt the seal the solace of their sin till dewy sleep oppressed them wearied with their amorous play soon as the force of that fallacious fruit that with exhilarating vapour bland about their spirits had played and inmost powers made err was now exhaled and grosser sleep bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams incumbered now had left them up they rose as from unrest and each the other viewing soon found their eyes how opened and their minds how darkened innocence that as a veil had shadowed them from knowing ill was gone just confidence and native righteousness and honour from about them naked left to guilty shame he covered but his robe uncovered more so rose the danite strong herculean samson from the harlot-lap of philistean dalilah and waked shorn of his strength they destitute and bare of all their virtue silent and in face confounded long they sat as strucken mute till adam though not less than eve abashed at length gave utterance to these words constrained o eve in evil hour thou didst give ear to that false worm of whomsoever taught to counterfeit man's voice true in our fall false in our promised rising since our eyes opened we find indeed and find we know both good and evil good lost and evil got bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know which leaves us naked thus of honour void of innocence of faith of purity our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained and in our faces evident the signs of foul concupiscence whence evil store even shame the last of evils of the first be sure then -- how shall i behold the face henceforth of god or angel erst with joy and rapture so oft beheld those heavenly shapes will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze insufferably bright o might i here in solitude live savage in some glade obscured where highest woods impenetrable to star or sun-light spread their umbrage broad and brown as evening cover me ye pines ye cedars with innumerable boughs hide me where i may never see them more -- but let us now as in bad plight devise what best may for the present serve to hide the parts of each from other that seem most to shame obnoxious and unseemliest seen some tree whose broad smooth leaves together sewed and girded on our loins may cover round those middle parts that this new comer shame there sit not and reproach us as unclean so counselled he and both together went into the thickest wood there soon they chose the fig-tree not that kind for fruit renowned but such as at this day to indians known in malabar or decan spreads her arms branching so broad and long that in the ground the bended twigs take root and daughters grow about the mother tree a pillared shade high over-arched and echoing walks between there oft the indian herdsman shunning heat shelters in cool and tends his pasturing herds at loop-holes cut through thickest shade those leaves they gathered broad as amazonian targe and with what skill they had together sewed to gird their waist vain covering if to hide their guilt and dreaded shame o how unlike to that first naked glory such of late columbus found the american so girt with feathered cincture naked else and wild among the trees on isles and woody shores thus fenced and as they thought their shame in part covered but not at rest or ease of mind they sat them down to weep nor only tears rained at their eyes but high winds worse within began to rise high passions anger hate mistrust suspicion discord and shook sore their inward state of mind calm region once and full of peace now tost and turbulent for understanding ruled not and the will heard not her lore both in subjection now to sensual appetite who from beneath usurping over sovran reason claimed superiour sway from thus distempered breast adam estranged in look and altered style speech intermitted thus to eve renewed would thou hadst hearkened to my words and staid with me as i besought thee when that strange desire of wandering this unhappy morn i know not whence possessed thee we had then remained still happy not as now despoiled of all our good shamed naked miserable let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve the faith they owe when earnestly they seek such proof conclude they then begin to fail to whom soon moved with touch of blame thus eve what words have passed thy lips adam severe imputest thou that to my default or will of wandering as thou callest it which who knows but might as ill have happened thou being by or to thyself perhaps hadst thou been there or here the attempt thou couldst not have discerned fraud in the serpent speaking as he spake no ground of enmity between us known why he should mean me ill or seek to harm was i to have never parted from thy side as good have grown there still a lifeless rib being as i am why didst not thou the head command me absolutely not to go going into such danger as thou saidst too facile then thou didst not much gainsay nay didst permit approve and fair dismiss hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent neither had i transgressed nor thou with me to whom then first incensed adam replied is this the love is this the recompence of mine to thee ingrateful eve expressed immutable when thou wert lost not i who might have lived and joyed immortal bliss yet willingly chose rather death with thee and am i now upbraided as the cause of thy transgressing not enough severe it seems in thy restraint what could i more i warned thee i admonished thee foretold the danger and the lurking enemy that lay in wait beyond this had been force and force upon free will hath here no place but confidence then bore thee on secure either to meet no danger or to find matter of glorious trial and perhaps i also erred in overmuch admiring what seemed in thee so perfect that i thought no evil durst attempt thee but i rue the errour now which is become my crime and thou the accuser thus it shall befall him who to worth in women overtrusting lets her will rule restraint she will not brook and left to herself if evil thence ensue she first his weak indulgence will accuse thus they in mutual accusation spent the fruitless hours but neither self-condemning and of their vain contest appeared no end book x mean while the heinous and despiteful act of satan done in paradise and how he in the serpent had perverted eve her husband she to taste the fatal fruit was known in heaven for what can 'scape the eye of god all-seeing or deceive his heart omniscient who in all things wise and just hindered not satan to attempt the mind of man with strength entire and free will armed complete to have discovered and repulsed whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend for still they knew and ought to have still remembered the high injunction not to taste that fruit whoever tempted which they not obeying incurred what could they less the penalty and manifold in sin deserved to fall up into heaven from paradise in haste the angelick guards ascended mute and sad for man for of his state by this they knew much wondering how the subtle fiend had stolen entrance unseen soon as the unwelcome news from earth arrived at heaven-gate displeased all were who heard dim sadness did not spare that time celestial visages yet mixed with pity violated not their bliss about the new-arrived in multitudes the ethereal people ran to hear and know how all befel they towards the throne supreme accountable made haste to make appear with righteous plea their utmost vigilance and easily approved when the most high eternal father from his secret cloud amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice assembled angels and ye powers returned from unsuccessful charge be not dismayed nor troubled at these tidings from the earth which your sincerest care could not prevent foretold so lately what would come to pass when first this tempter crossed the gulf from hell i told ye then he should prevail and speed on his bad errand man should be seduced and flattered out of all believing lies against his maker no decree of mine concurring to necessitate his fall or touch with lightest moment of impulse his free will to her own inclining left in even scale but fallen he is and now what rests but that the mortal sentence pass on his transgression -- death denounced that day which he presumes already vain and void because not yet inflicted as he feared by some immediate stroke but soon shall find forbearance no acquittance ere day end justice shall not return as bounty scorned but whom send i to judge them whom but thee vicegerent son to thee i have transferred all judgement whether in heaven or earth or hell easy it may be seen that i intend mercy colleague with justice sending thee man's friend his mediator his designed both ransom and redeemer voluntary and destined man himself to judge man fallen so spake the father and unfolding bright toward the right hand his glory on the son blazed forth unclouded deity he full resplendent all his father manifest expressed and thus divinely answered mild father eternal thine is to decree mine both in heaven and earth to do thy will supreme that thou in me thy son beloved mayest ever rest well pleased i go to judge on earth these thy transgressours but thou knowest whoever judged the worst on me must light when time shall be for so i undertook before thee and not repenting this obtain of right that i may mitigate their doom on me derived yet i shall temper so justice with mercy as may illustrate most them fully satisfied and thee appease attendance none shall need nor train where none are to behold the judgement but the judged those two the third best absent is condemned convict by flight and rebel to all law conviction to the serpent none belongs thus saying from his radiant seat he rose of high collateral glory him thrones and powers princedoms and dominations ministrant accompanied to heaven-gate from whence eden and all the coast in prospect lay down he descended straight the speed of gods time counts not though with swiftest minutes winged now was the sun in western cadence low from noon and gentle airs due at their hour to fan the earth now waked and usher in the evening cool when he from wrath more cool came the mild judge and intercessour both to sentence man the voice of god they heard now walking in the garden by soft winds brought to their ears while day declined they heard and from his presence hid themselves among the thickest trees both man and wife till god approaching thus to adam called aloud where art thou adam wont with joy to meet my coming seen far off i miss thee here not pleased thus entertained with solitude where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought or come i less conspicuous or what change absents thee or what chance detains -- come forth he came and with him eve more loth though first to offend discountenanced both and discomposed love was not in their looks either to god or to each other but apparent guilt and shame and perturbation and despair anger and obstinacy and hate and guile whence adam faltering long thus answered brief i heard thee in the garden and of thy voice afraid being naked hid myself to whom the gracious judge without revile replied my voice thou oft hast heard and hast not feared but still rejoiced how is it now become so dreadful to thee that thou art naked who hath told thee hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat to whom thus adam sore beset replied o heaven in evil strait this day i stand before my judge either to undergo myself the total crime or to accuse my other self the partner of my life whose failing while her faith to me remains i should conceal and not expose to blame by my complaint but strict necessity subdues me and calamitous constraint lest on my head both sin and punishment however insupportable be all devolved though should i hold my peace yet thou wouldst easily detect what i conceal -- this woman whom thou madest to be my help and gavest me as thy perfect gift so good so fit so acceptable so divine that from her hand i could suspect no ill and what she did whatever in itself her doing seemed to justify the deed she gave me of the tree and i did eat to whom the sovran presence thus replied was she thy god that her thou didst obey before his voice or was she made thy guide superiour or but equal that to her thou didst resign thy manhood and the place wherein god set thee above her made of thee and for thee whose perfection far excelled hers in all real dignity adorned she was indeed and lovely to attract thy love not thy subjection and her gifts were such as under government well seemed unseemly to bear rule which was thy part and person hadst thou known thyself aright so having said he thus to eve in few say woman what is this which thou hast done to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelmed confessing soon yet not before her judge bold or loquacious thus abashed replied the serpent me beguiled and i did eat which when the lord god heard without delay to judgement he proceeded on the accused serpent though brute unable to transfer the guilt on him who made him instrument of mischief and polluted from the end of his creation justly then accursed as vitiated in nature more to know concerned not man since he no further knew nor altered his offence yet god at last to satan first in sin his doom applied though in mysterious terms judged as then best and on the serpent thus his curse let fall because thou hast done this thou art accursed above all cattle each beast of the field upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go and dust shalt eat all the days of thy life between thee and the woman i will put enmity and between thine and her seed her seed shall bruise thy head thou bruise his heel so spake this oracle then verified when jesus son of mary second eve saw satan fall like lightning down from heaven prince of the air then rising from his grave spoiled principalities and powers triumphed in open show and with ascension bright captivity led captive through the air the realm itself of satan long usurped whom he shall tread at last under our feet even he who now foretold his fatal bruise and to the woman thus his sentence turned thy sorrow i will greatly multiply by thy conception children thou shalt bring in sorrow forth and to thy husband's will thine shall submit he over thee shall rule on adam last thus judgement he pronounced because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife and eaten of the tree concerning which i charged thee saying thou shalt not eat thereof cursed is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow shalt eat thereof all the days of thy life thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth unbid and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for thou out of the ground wast taken know thy birth for dust thou art and shalt to dust return so judged he man both judge and saviour sent and the instant stroke of death denounced that day removed far off then pitying how they stood before him naked to the air that now must suffer change disdained not to begin thenceforth the form of servant to assume as when he washed his servants feet so now as father of his family he clad their nakedness with skins of beasts or slain or as the snake with youthful coat repaid and thought not much to clothe his enemies nor he their outward only with the skins of beasts but inward nakedness much more opprobrious with his robe of righteousness arraying covered from his father's sight to him with swift ascent he up returned into his blissful bosom reassumed in glory as of old to him appeased all though all-knowing what had passed with man recounted mixing intercession sweet mean while ere thus was sinned and judged on earth within the gates of hell sat sin and death in counterview within the gates that now stood open wide belching outrageous flame far into chaos since the fiend passed through sin opening who thus now to death began o son why sit we here each other viewing idly while satan our great author thrives in other worlds and happier seat provides for us his offspring dear it cannot be but that success attends him if mishap ere this he had returned with fury driven by his avengers since no place like this can fit his punishment or their revenge methinks i feel new strength within me rise wings growing and dominion given me large beyond this deep whatever draws me on or sympathy or some connatural force powerful at greatest distance to unite with secret amity things of like kind by secretest conveyance thou my shade inseparable must with me along for death from sin no power can separate but lest the difficulty of passing back stay his return perhaps over this gulf impassable impervious let us try adventurous work yet to thy power and mine not unagreeable to found a path over this main from hell to that new world where satan now prevails a monument of merit high to all the infernal host easing their passage hence for intercourse or transmigration as their lot shall lead nor can i miss the way so strongly drawn by this new-felt attraction and instinct whom thus the meager shadow answered soon go whither fate and inclination strong leads thee i shall not lag behind nor err the way thou leading such a scent i draw of carnage prey innumerable and taste the savour of death from all things there that live nor shall i to the work thou enterprisest be wanting but afford thee equal aid so saying with delight he snuffed the smell of mortal change on earth as when a flock of ravenous fowl though many a league remote against the day of battle to a field where armies lie encamped come flying lured with scent of living carcasses designed for death the following day in bloody fight so scented the grim feature and upturned his nostril wide into the murky air sagacious of his quarry from so far then both from out hell-gates into the waste wide anarchy of chaos damp and dark flew diverse and with power their power was great hovering upon the waters what they met solid or slimy as in raging sea tost up and down together crouded drove from each side shoaling towards the mouth of hell as when two polar winds blowing adverse upon the cronian sea together drive mountains of ice that stop the imagined way beyond petsora eastward to the rich cathaian coast the aggregated soil death with his mace petrifick cold and dry as with a trident smote and fixed as firm as delos floating once the rest his look bound with gorgonian rigour not to move and with asphaltick slime broad as the gate deep to the roots of hell the gathered beach they fastened and the mole immense wrought on over the foaming deep high-arched a bridge of length prodigious joining to the wall immoveable of this now fenceless world forfeit to death from hence a passage broad smooth easy inoffensive down to hell so if great things to small may be compared xerxes the liberty of greece to yoke from susa his memnonian palace high came to the sea and over hellespont bridging his way europe with asia joined and scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves now had they brought the work by wonderous art pontifical a ridge of pendant rock over the vexed abyss following the track of satan to the self-same place where he first lighted from his wing and landed safe from out of chaos to the outside bare of this round world with pins of adamant and chains they made all fast too fast they made and durable and now in little space the confines met of empyrean heaven and of this world and on the left hand hell with long reach interposed three several ways in sight to each of these three places led and now their way to earth they had descried to paradise first tending when behold satan in likeness of an angel bright betwixt the centaur and the scorpion steering his zenith while the sun in aries rose disguised he came but those his children dear their parent soon discerned though in disguise he after eve seduced unminded slunk into the wood fast by and changing shape to observe the sequel saw his guileful act by eve though all unweeting seconded upon her husband saw their shame that sought vain covertures but when he saw descend the son of god to judge them terrified he fled not hoping to escape but shun the present fearing guilty what his wrath might suddenly inflict that past returned by night and listening where the hapless pair sat in their sad discourse and various plaint thence gathered his own doom which understood not instant but of future time with joy and tidings fraught to hell he now returned and at the brink of chaos near the foot of this new wonderous pontifice unhoped met who to meet him came his offspring dear great joy was at their meeting and at sight of that stupendious bridge his joy encreased long he admiring stood till sin his fair enchanting daughter thus the silence broke o parent these are thy magnifick deeds thy trophies which thou viewest as not thine own thou art their author and prime architect for i no sooner in my heart divined my heart which by a secret harmony still moves with thine joined in connexion sweet that thou on earth hadst prospered which thy looks now also evidence but straight i felt though distant from thee worlds between yet felt that i must after thee with this thy son such fatal consequence unites us three hell could no longer hold us in our bounds nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure detain from following thy illustrious track thou hast achieved our liberty confined within hell-gates till now thou us impowered to fortify thus far and overlay with this portentous bridge the dark abyss thine now is all this world thy virtue hath won what thy hands builded not thy wisdom gained with odds what war hath lost and fully avenged our foil in heaven here thou shalt monarch reign there didst not there let him still victor sway as battle hath adjudged from this new world retiring by his own doom alienated and henceforth monarchy with thee divide of all things parted by the empyreal bounds his quadrature from thy orbicular world or try thee now more dangerous to his throne whom thus the prince of darkness answered glad fair daughter and thou son and grandchild both high proof ye now have given to be the race of satan for i glory in the name antagonist of heaven's almighty king amply have merited of me of all the infernal empire that so near heaven's door triumphal with triumphal act have met mine with this glorious work and made one realm hell and this world one realm one continent of easy thorough-fare therefore while i descend through darkness on your road with ease to my associate powers them to acquaint with these successes and with them rejoice you two this way among these numerous orbs all yours right down to paradise descend there dwell and reign in bliss thence on the earth dominion exercise and in the air chiefly on man sole lord of all declared him first make sure your thrall and lastly kill my substitutes i send ye and create plenipotent on earth of matchless might issuing from me on your joint vigour now my hold of this new kingdom all depends through sin to death exposed by my exploit if your joint power prevail the affairs of hell no detriment need fear go and be strong so saying he dismissed them they with speed their course through thickest constellations held spreading their bane the blasted stars looked wan and planets planet-struck real eclipse then suffered the other way satan went down the causey to hell-gate on either side disparted chaos overbuilt exclaimed and with rebounding surge the bars assailed that scorned his indignation through the gate wide open and unguarded satan passed and all about found desolate for those appointed to sit there had left their charge flown to the upper world the rest were all far to the inland retired about the walls of pandemonium city and proud seat of lucifer so by allusion called of that bright star to satan paragoned there kept their watch the legions while the grand in council sat solicitous what chance might intercept their emperour sent so he departing gave command and they observed as when the tartar from his russian foe by astracan over the snowy plains retires or bactrin sophi from the horns of turkish crescent leaves all waste beyond the realm of aladule in his retreat to tauris or casbeen so these the late heaven-banished host left desart utmost hell many a dark league reduced in careful watch round their metropolis and now expecting each hour their great adventurer from the search of foreign worlds he through the midst unmarked in show plebeian angel militant of lowest order passed and from the door of that plutonian hall invisible ascended his high throne which under state of richest texture spread at the upper end was placed in regal lustre down a while he sat and round about him saw unseen at last as from a cloud his fulgent head and shape star-bright appeared or brighter clad with what permissive glory since his fall was left him or false glitter all amazed at that so sudden blaze the stygian throng bent their aspect and whom they wished beheld their mighty chief returned loud was the acclaim forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers raised from their dark divan and with like joy congratulant approached him who with hand silence and with these words attention won thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers for in possession such not only of right i call ye and declare ye now returned successful beyond hope to lead ye forth triumphant out of this infernal pit abominable accursed the house of woe and dungeon of our tyrant now possess as lords a spacious world to our native heaven little inferiour by my adventure hard with peril great achieved long were to tell what i have done what suffered with what pain voyaged th' unreal vast unbounded deep of horrible confusion over which by sin and death a broad way now is paved to expedite your glorious march but i toiled out my uncouth passage forced to ride the untractable abyss plunged in the womb of unoriginal night and chaos wild that jealous of their secrets fiercely opposed my journey strange with clamorous uproar protesting fate supreme thence how i found the new created world which fame in heaven long had foretold a fabrick wonderful of absolute perfection therein man placed in a paradise by our exile made happy him by fraud i have seduced from his creator and the more to encrease your wonder with an apple he thereat offended worth your laughter hath given up both his beloved man and all his world to sin and death a prey and so to us without our hazard labour or alarm to range in and to dwell and over man to rule as over all he should have ruled true is me also he hath judged or rather me not but the brute serpent in whose shape man i deceived that which to me belongs is enmity which he will put between me and mankind i am to bruise his heel his seed when is not set shall bruise my head a world who would not purchase with a bruise or much more grievous pain -- ye have the account of my performance what remains ye gods but up and enter now into full bliss so having said a while he stood expecting their universal shout and high applause to fill his ear when contrary he hears on all sides from innumerable tongues a dismal universal hiss the sound of publick scorn he wondered but not long had leisure wondering at himself now more his visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare his arms clung to his ribs his legs entwining each other till supplanted down he fell a monstrous serpent on his belly prone reluctant but in vain a greater power now ruled him punished in the shape he sinned according to his doom he would have spoke but hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue to forked tongue for now were all transformed alike to serpents all as accessories to his bold riot dreadful was the din of hissing through the hall thick swarming now with complicated monsters head and tail scorpion and asp and amphisbaena dire cerastes horned hydrus and elops drear and dipsas not so thick swarmed once the soil bedropt with blood of gorgon or the isle ophiusa but still greatest he the midst now dragon grown larger than whom the sun ingendered in the pythian vale or slime huge python and his power no less he seemed above the rest still to retain they all him followed issuing forth to the open field where all yet left of that revolted rout heaven-fallen in station stood or just array sublime with expectation when to see in triumph issuing forth their glorious chief they saw but other sight instead a croud of ugly serpents horrour on them fell and horrid sympathy for what they saw they felt themselves now changing down their arms down fell both spear and shield down they as fast and the dire hiss renewed and the dire form catched by contagion like in punishment as in their crime thus was the applause they meant turned to exploding hiss triumph to shame cast on themselves from their own mouths there stood a grove hard by sprung up with this their change his will who reigns above to aggravate their penance laden with fair fruit like that which grew in paradise the bait of eve used by the tempter on that prospect strange their earnest eyes they fixed imagining for one forbidden tree a multitude now risen to work them further woe or shame yet parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce though to delude them sent could not abstain but on they rolled in heaps and up the trees climbing sat thicker than the snaky locks that curled megaera greedily they plucked the fruitage fair to sight like that which grew near that bituminous lake where sodom flamed this more delusive not the touch but taste deceived they fondly thinking to allay their appetite with gust instead of fruit chewed bitter ashes which the offended taste with spattering noise rejected oft they assayed hunger and thirst constraining drugged as oft with hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws with soot and cinders filled so oft they fell into the same illusion not as man whom they triumphed once lapsed thus were they plagued and worn with famine long and ceaseless hiss till their lost shape permitted they resumed yearly enjoined some say to undergo this annual humbling certain numbered days to dash their pride and joy for man seduced however some tradition they dispersed among the heathen of their purchase got and fabled how the serpent whom they called ophion with eurynome the wide -- encroaching eve perhaps had first the rule of high olympus thence by saturn driven and ops ere yet dictaean jove was born mean while in paradise the hellish pair too soon arrived sin there in power before once actual now in body and to dwell habitual habitant behind her death close following pace for pace not mounted yet on his pale horse to whom sin thus began second of satan sprung all-conquering death what thinkest thou of our empire now though earned with travel difficult not better far than still at hell's dark threshold to have sat watch unnamed undreaded and thyself half starved whom thus the sin-born monster answered soon to me who with eternal famine pine alike is hell or paradise or heaven there best where most with ravine i may meet which here though plenteous all too little seems to stuff this maw this vast unhide-bound corps to whom the incestuous mother thus replied thou therefore on these herbs and fruits and flowers feed first on each beast next and fish and fowl no homely morsels and whatever thing the sithe of time mows down devour unspared till i in man residing through the race his thoughts his looks words actions all infect and season him thy last and sweetest prey this said they both betook them several ways both to destroy or unimmortal make all kinds and for destruction to mature sooner or later which the almighty seeing from his transcendent seat the saints among to those bright orders uttered thus his voice see with what heat these dogs of hell advance to waste and havock yonder world which i so fair and good created and had still kept in that state had not the folly of man let in these wasteful furies who impute folly to me so doth the prince of hell and his adherents that with so much ease i suffer them to enter and possess a place so heavenly and conniving seem to gratify my scornful enemies that laugh as if transported with some fit of passion i to them had quitted all at random yielded up to their misrule and know not that i called and drew them thither my hell-hounds to lick up the draff and filth which man's polluting sin with taint hath shed on what was pure til crammed and gorged nigh burst with sucked and glutted offal at one sling of thy victorious arm well-pleasing son both sin and death and yawning grave at last through chaos hurled obstruct the mouth of hell for ever and seal up his ravenous jaws then heaven and earth renewed shall be made pure to sanctity that shall receive no stain till then the curse pronounced on both precedes he ended and the heavenly audience loud sung halleluiah as the sound of seas through multitude that sung just are thy ways righteous are thy decrees on all thy works who can extenuate thee next to the son destined restorer of mankind by whom new heaven and earth shall to the ages rise or down from heaven descend -- such was their song while the creator calling forth by name his mighty angels gave them several charge as sorted best with present things the sun had first his precept so to move so shine as might affect the earth with cold and heat scarce tolerable and from the north to call decrepit winter from the south to bring solstitial summer's heat to the blanc moon her office they prescribed to the other five their planetary motions and aspects in sextile square and trine and opposite of noxious efficacy and when to join in synod unbenign and taught the fixed their influence malignant when to shower which of them rising with the sun or falling should prove tempestuous to the winds they set their corners when with bluster to confound sea air and shore the thunder when to roll with terrour through the dark aereal hall some say he bid his angels turn ascanse the poles of earth twice ten degrees and more from the sun's axle they with labour pushed oblique the centrick globe some say the sun was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road like distant breadth to taurus with the seven atlantick sisters and the spartan twins up to the tropick crab thence down amain by leo and the virgin and the scales as deep as capricorn to bring in change of seasons to each clime else had the spring perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers equal in days and nights except to those beyond the polar circles to them day had unbenighted shone while the low sun to recompense his distance in their sight had rounded still the horizon and not known or east or west which had forbid the snow from cold estotiland and south as far beneath magellan at that tasted fruit the sun as from thyestean banquet turned his course intended else how had the world inhabited though sinless more than now avoided pinching cold and scorching heat these changes in the heavens though slow produced like change on sea and land sideral blast vapour and mist and exhalation hot corrupt and pestilent now from the north of norumbega and the samoed shore bursting their brazen dungeon armed with ice and snow and hail and stormy gust and flaw boreas and caecias and argestes loud and thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn with adverse blast upturns them from the south notus and afer black with thunderous clouds from serraliona thwart of these as fierce forth rush the levant and the ponent winds eurus and zephyr with their lateral noise sirocco and libecchio thus began outrage from lifeless things but discord first daughter of sin among the irrational death introduced through fierce antipathy beast now with beast 'gan war and fowl with fowl and fish with fish to graze the herb all leaving devoured each other nor stood much in awe of man but fled him or with countenance grim glared on him passing these were from without the growing miseries which adam saw already in part though hid in gloomiest shade to sorrow abandoned but worse felt within and in a troubled sea of passion tost thus to disburden sought with sad complaint o miserable of happy is this the end of this new glorious world and me so late the glory of that glory who now become accursed of blessed hide me from the face of god whom to behold was then my highth of happiness -- yet well if here would end the misery i deserved it and would bear my own deservings but this will not serve all that i eat or drink or shall beget is propagated curse o voice once heard delightfully encrease and multiply now death to hear for what can i encrease or multiply but curses on my head who of all ages to succeed but feeling the evil on him brought by me will curse my head ill fare our ancestor impure for this we may thank adam but his thanks shall be the execration so besides mine own that bide upon me all from me shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound on me as on their natural center light heavy though in their place o fleeting joys of paradise dear bought with lasting woes did i request thee maker from my clay to mould me man did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me or here place in this delicious garden as my will concurred not to my being it were but right and equal to reduce me to my dust desirous to resign and render back all i received unable to perform thy terms too hard by which i was to hold the good i sought not to the loss of that sufficient penalty why hast thou added the sense of endless woes inexplicable why am i mocked with death and lengthened out to deathless pain how gladly would i meet mortality my sentence and be earth insensible how glad would lay me down as in my mother's lap there i should rest and sleep secure his dreadful voice no more would thunder in my ears no fear of worse to me and to my offspring would torment me with cruel expectation yet one doubt pursues me still lest all i cannot die lest that pure breath of life the spirit of man which god inspired cannot together perish with this corporeal clod then in the grave or in some other dismal place who knows but i shall die a living death o thought horrid if true yet why it was but breath of life that sinned what dies but what had life and sin the body properly had neither all of me then shall die let this appease the doubt since human reach no further knows for though the lord of all be infinite is his wrath also be it man is not so but mortal doomed how can he exercise wrath without end on man whom death must end can he make deathless death that were to make strange contradiction which to god himself impossible is held as argument of weakness not of power will he draw out for anger's sake finite to infinite in punished man to satisfy his rigour satisfied never that were to extend his sentence beyond dust and nature's law by which all causes else according still to the reception of their matter act not to the extent of their own sphere but say that death be not one stroke as i supposed bereaving sense but endless misery from this day onward which i feel begun both in me and without me and so last to perpetuity -- ay me that fear comes thundering back with dreadful revolution on my defenceless head both death and i am found eternal and incorporate both nor i on my part single in me all posterity stands cursed fair patrimony that i must leave ye sons o were i able to waste it all myself and leave ye none so disinherited how would you bless me now your curse ah why should all mankind for one man's fault thus guiltless be condemned it guiltless but from me what can proceed but all corrupt both mind and will depraved not to do only but to will the same with me how can they then acquitted stand in sight of god him after all disputes forced i absolve all my evasions vain and reasonings though through mazes lead me still but to my own conviction first and last on me me only as the source and spring of all corruption all the blame lights due so might the wrath fond wish couldst thou support that burden heavier than the earth to bear than all the world much heavier though divided with that bad woman thus what thou desirest and what thou fearest alike destroys all hope of refuge and concludes thee miserable beyond all past example and future to satan only like both crime and doom o conscience into what abyss of fears and horrours hast thou driven me out of which i find no way from deep to deeper plunged thus adam to himself lamented loud through the still night not now as ere man fell wholesome and cool and mild but with black air accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom which to his evil conscience represented all things with double terrour on the ground outstretched he lay on the cold ground and oft cursed his creation death as oft accused of tardy execution since denounced the day of his offence why comes not death said he with one thrice-acceptable stroke to end me shall truth fail to keep her word justice divine not hasten to be just but death comes not at call justice divine mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries o woods o fountains hillocks dales and bowers with other echo late i taught your shades to answer and resound far other song -- whom thus afflicted when sad eve beheld desolate where she sat approaching nigh soft words to his fierce passion she assayed but her with stern regard he thus repelled out of my sight thou serpent that name best befits thee with him leagued thyself as false and hateful nothing wants but that thy shape like his and colour serpentine may show thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee henceforth lest that too heavenly form pretended to hellish falshood snare them but for thee i had persisted happy had not thy pride and wandering vanity when least was safe rejected my forewarning and disdained not to be trusted longing to be seen though by the devil himself him overweening to over-reach but with the serpent meeting fooled and beguiled by him thou i by thee to trust thee from my side imagined wise constant mature proof against all assaults and understood not all was but a show rather than solid virtue all but a rib crooked by nature bent as now appears more to the part sinister from me drawn well if thrown out as supernumerary to my just number found o why did god creator wise that peopled highest heaven with spirits masculine create at last this novelty on earth this fair defect of nature and not fill the world at once with men as angels without feminine or find some other way to generate mankind this mischief had not been befallen and more that shall befall innumerable disturbances on earth through female snares and strait conjunction with this sex for either he never shall find out fit mate but such as some misfortune brings him or mistake or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain through her perverseness but shall see her gained by a far worse or if she love withheld by parents or his happiest choice too late shall meet already linked and wedlock-bound to a fell adversary his hate or shame which infinite calamity shall cause to human life and houshold peace confound he added not and from her turned but eve not so repulsed with tears that ceased not flowing and tresses all disordered at his feet fell humble and embracing them besought his peace and thus proceeded in her plaint forsake me not thus adam witness heaven what love sincere and reverence in my heart i bear thee and unweeting have offended unhappily deceived thy suppliant i beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not whereon i live thy gentle looks thy aid thy counsel in this uttermost distress my only strength and stay forlorn of thee whither shall i betake me where subsist while yet we live scarce one short hour perhaps between us two let there be peace both joining as joined in injuries one enmity against a foe by doom express assigned us that cruel serpent on me exercise not thy hatred for this misery befallen on me already lost me than thyself more miserable both have sinned but thou against god only i against god and thee and to the place of judgement will return there with my cries importune heaven that all the sentence from thy head removed may light on me sole cause to thee of all this woe me me only just object of his ire she ended weeping and her lowly plight immoveable till peace obtained from fault acknowledged and deplored in adam wrought commiseration soon his heart relented towards her his life so late and sole delight now at his feet submissive in distress creature so fair his reconcilement seeking his counsel whom she had displeased his aid as one disarmed his anger all he lost and thus with peaceful words upraised her soon unwary and too desirous as before so now of what thou knowest not who desirest the punishment all on thyself alas bear thine own first ill able to sustain his full wrath whose thou feelest as yet least part and my displeasure bearest so ill if prayers could alter high decrees i to that place would speed before thee and be louder heard that on my head all might be visited thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven to me committed and by me exposed but rise -- let us no more contend nor blame each other blamed enough elsewhere but strive in offices of love how we may lighten each other's burden in our share of woe since this day's death denounced if aught i see will prove no sudden but a slow-paced evil a long day's dying to augment our pain and to our seed o hapless seed derived to whom thus eve recovering heart replied adam by sad experiment i know how little weight my words with thee can find found so erroneous thence by just event found so unfortunate nevertheless restored by thee vile as i am to place of new acceptance hopeful to regain thy love the sole contentment of my heart living or dying from thee i will not hide what thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen tending to some relief of our extremes or end though sharp and sad yet tolerable as in our evils and of easier choice if care of our descent perplex us most which must be born to certain woe devoured by death at last and miserable it is to be to others cause of misery our own begotten and of our loins to bring into this cursed world a woeful race that after wretched life must be at last food for so foul a monster in thy power it lies yet ere conception to prevent the race unblest to being yet unbegot childless thou art childless remain so death shall be deceived his glut and with us two be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw but if thou judge it hard and difficult conversing looking loving to abstain from love's due rights nuptial embraces sweet and with desire to languish without hope before the present object languishing with like desire which would be misery and torment less than none of what we dread then both ourselves and seed at once to free from what we fear for both let us make short -- let us seek death -- or he not found supply with our own hands his office on ourselves why stand we longer shivering under fears that show no end but death and have the power of many ways to die the shortest choosing destruction with destruction to destroy -- she ended here or vehement despair broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts had entertained as dyed her cheeks with pale but adam with such counsel nothing swayed to better hopes his more attentive mind labouring had raised and thus to eve replied eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems to argue in thee something more sublime and excellent than what thy mind contemns but self-destruction therefore sought refutes that excellence thought in thee and implies not thy contempt but anguish and regret for loss of life and pleasure overloved or if thou covet death as utmost end of misery so thinking to evade the penalty pronounced doubt not but god hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire than so to be forestalled much more i fear lest death so snatched will not exempt us from the pain we are by doom to pay rather such acts of contumacy will provoke the highest to make death in us live then let us seek some safer resolution which methinks i have in view calling to mind with heed part of our sentence that thy seed shall bruise the serpent's head piteous amends unless be meant whom i conjecture our grand foe satan who in the serpent hath contrived against us this deceit to crush his head would be revenge indeed which will be lost by death brought on ourselves or childless days resolved as thou proposest so our foe shal 'scape his punishment ordained and we instead shall double ours upon our heads no more be mentioned then of violence against ourselves and wilful barrenness that cuts us off from hope and savours only rancour and pride impatience and despite reluctance against god and his just yoke laid on our necks remember with what mild and gracious temper he both heard and judged without wrath or reviling we expected immediate dissolution which we thought was meant by death that day when lo to thee pains only in child-bearing were foretold and bringing forth soon recompensed with joy fruit of thy womb on me the curse aslope glanced on the ground with labour i must earn my bread what harm idleness had been worse my labour will sustain me and lest cold or heat should injure us his timely care hath unbesought provided and his hands clothed us unworthy pitying while he judged how much more if we pray him will his ear be open and his heart to pity incline and teach us further by what means to shun the inclement seasons rain ice hail and snow which now the sky with various face begins to show us in this mountain while the winds blow moist and keen shattering the graceful locks of these fair spreading trees which bids us seek some better shroud some better warmth to cherish our limbs benummed ere this diurnal star leave cold the night how we his gathered beams reflected may with matter sere foment or by collision of two bodies grind the air attrite to fire as late the clouds justling or pushed with winds rude in their shock tine the slant lightning whose thwart flame driven down kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine and sends a comfortable heat from far which might supply the sun such fire to use and what may else be remedy or cure to evils which our own misdeeds have wrought he will instruct us praying and of grace beseeching him so as we need not fear to pass commodiously this life sustained by him with many comforts till we end in dust our final rest and native home what better can we do than to the place repairing where he judged us prostrate fall before him reverent and there confess humbly our faults and pardon beg with tears watering the ground and with our sighs the air frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek book xi undoubtedly he will relent and turn from his displeasure in whose look serene when angry most he seemed and most severe what else but favour grace and mercy shone so spake our father penitent nor eve felt less remorse they forthwith to the place repairing where he judged them prostrate fell before him reverent and both confessed humbly their faults and pardon begged with tears watering the ground and with their sighs the air frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood praying for from the mercy-seat above prevenient grace descending had removed the stony from their hearts and made new flesh regenerate grow instead that sighs now breathed unutterable which the spirit of prayer inspired and winged for heaven with speedier flight than loudest oratory yet their port not of mean suitors nor important less seemed their petition than when the ancient pair in fables old less ancient yet than these deucalion and chaste pyrrha to restore the race of mankind drowned before the shrine of themis stood devout to heaven their prayers flew up nor missed the way by envious winds blown vagabond or frustrate in they passed dimensionless through heavenly doors then clad with incense where the golden altar fumed by their great intercessour came in sight before the father's throne them the glad son presenting thus to intercede began see father what first-fruits on earth are sprung from thy implanted grace in man these sighs and prayers which in this golden censer mixed with incense i thy priest before thee bring fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed sown with contrition in his heart than those which his own hand manuring all the trees of paradise could have produced ere fallen from innocence now therefore bend thine ear to supplication hear his sighs though mute unskilful with what words to pray let me interpret for him me his advocate and propitiation all his works on me good or not good ingraft my merit those shall perfect and for these my death shall pay accept me and in me from these receive the smell of peace toward mankind let him live before thee reconciled at least his days numbered though sad till death his doom which i to mitigate thus plead not to reverse to better life shall yield him where with me all my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss made one with me as i with thee am one to whom the father without cloud serene all thy request for man accepted son obtain all thy request was my decree but longer in that paradise to dwell the law i gave to nature him forbids those pure immortal elements that know no gross no unharmonious mixture foul eject him tainted now and purge him off as a distemper gross to air as gross and mortal food as may dispose him best for dissolution wrought by sin that first distempered all things and of incorrupt corrupted i at first with two fair gifts created him endowed with happiness and immortality that fondly lost this other served but to eternize woe till i provided death so death becomes his final remedy and after life tried in sharp tribulation and refined by faith and faithful works to second life waked in the renovation of the just resigns him up with heaven and earth renewed but let us call to synod all the blest through heaven's wide bounds from them i will not hide my judgements how with mankind i proceed as how with peccant angels late they saw and in their state though firm stood more confirmed he ended and the son gave signal high to the bright minister that watched he blew his trumpet heard in oreb since perhaps when god descended and perhaps once more to sound at general doom the angelick blast filled all the regions from their blisful bowers of amarantine shade fountain or spring by the waters of life where'er they sat in fellowships of joy the sons of light hasted resorting to the summons high and took their seats till from his throne supreme the almighty thus pronounced his sovran will o sons like one of us man is become to know both good and evil since his taste of that defended fruit but let him boast his knowledge of good lost and evil got happier had it sufficed him to have known good by itself and evil not at all he sorrows now repents and prays contrite my motions in him longer than they move his heart i know how variable and vain self-left lest therefore his now bolder hand reach also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever dream at least to live for ever to remove him i decree and send him from the garden forth to till the ground whence he was taken fitter soil michael this my behest have thou in charge take to thee from among the cherubim thy choice of flaming warriours lest the fiend or in behalf of man or to invade vacant possession some new trouble raise haste thee and from the paradise of god without remorse drive out the sinful pair from hallowed ground the unholy and denounce to them and to their progeny from thence perpetual banishment yet lest they faint at the sad sentence rigorously urged for i behold them softened and with tears bewailing their excess all terrour hide if patiently thy bidding they obey dismiss them not disconsolate reveal to adam what shall come in future days as i shall thee enlighten intermix my covenant in the woman's seed renewed so send them forth though sorrowing yet in peace and on the east side of the garden place where entrance up from eden easiest climbs cherubick watch and of a sword the flame wide-waving all approach far off to fright and guard all passage to the tree of life lest paradise a receptacle prove to spirits foul and all my trees their prey with whose stolen fruit man once more to delude he ceased and the arch-angelick power prepared for swift descent with him the cohort bright of watchful cherubim four faces each had like a double janus all their shape spangled with eyes more numerous than those of argus and more wakeful than to drouse charmed with arcadian pipe the pastoral reed of hermes or his opiate rod mean while to re-salute the world with sacred light leucothea waked and with fresh dews imbalmed the earth when adam and first matron eve had ended now their orisons and found strength added from above new hope to spring out of despair joy but with fear yet linked which thus to eve his welcome words renewed eve easily my faith admit that all the good which we enjoy from heaven descends but that from us aught should ascend to heaven so prevalent as to concern the mind of god high-blest or to incline his will hard to belief may seem yet this will prayer or one short sigh of human breath upborne even to the seat of god for since i sought by prayer the offended deity to appease kneeled and before him humbled all my heart methought i saw him placable and mild bending his ear persuasion in me grew that i was heard with favour peace returned home to my breast and to my memory his promise that thy seed shall bruise our foe which then not minded in dismay yet now assures me that the bitterness of death is past and we shall live whence hail to thee eve rightly called mother of all mankind mother of all things living since by thee man is to live and all things live for man to whom thus eve with sad demeanour meek ill-worthy i such title should belong to me transgressour who for thee ordained a help became thy snare to me reproach rather belongs distrust and all dispraise but infinite in pardon was my judge that i who first brought death on all am graced the source of life next favourable thou who highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf'st far other name deserving but the field to labour calls us now with sweat imposed though after sleepless night for see the morn all unconcerned with our unrest begins her rosy progress smiling let us forth i never from thy side henceforth to stray where'er our day's work lies though now enjoined laborious till day droop while here we dwell what can be toilsome in these pleasant walks here let us live though in fallen state content so spake so wished much humbled eve but fate subscribed not nature first gave signs impressed on bird beast air air suddenly eclipsed after short blush of morn nigh in her sight the bird of jove stooped from his aery tour two birds of gayest plume before him drove down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods first hunter then pursued a gentle brace goodliest of all the forest hart and hind direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight adam observed and with his eye the chase pursuing not unmoved to eve thus spake o eve some further change awaits us nigh which heaven by these mute signs in nature shows forerunners of his purpose or to warn us haply too secure of our discharge from penalty because from death released some days how long and what till then our life who knows or more than this that we are dust and thither must return and be no more why else this double object in our sight of flight pursued in the air and o'er the ground one way the self-same hour why in the east darkness ere day's mid-course and morning-light more orient in yon western cloud that draws o'er the blue firmament a radiant white and slow descends with something heavenly fraught he erred not for by this the heavenly bands down from a sky of jasper lighted now in paradise and on a hill made halt a glorious apparition had not doubt and carnal fear that day dimmed adam's eye not that more glorious when the angels met jacob in mahanaim where he saw the field pavilioned with his guardians bright nor that which on the flaming mount appeared in dothan covered with a camp of fire against the syrian king who to surprise one man assassin-like had levied war war unproclaimed the princely hierarch in their bright stand there left his powers to seise possession of the garden he alone to find where adam sheltered took his way not unperceived of adam who to eve while the great visitant approached thus spake eve now expect great tidings which perhaps of us will soon determine or impose new laws to be observed for i descry from yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill one of the heavenly host and by his gait none of the meanest some great potentate or of the thrones above such majesty invests him coming yet not terrible that i should fear nor sociably mild as raphael that i should much confide but solemn and sublime whom not to offend with reverence i must meet and thou retire he ended and the arch-angel soon drew nigh not in his shape celestial but as man clad to meet man over his lucid arms a military vest of purple flowed livelier than meliboean or the grain of sarra worn by kings and heroes old in time of truce iris had dipt the woof his starry helm unbuckled showed him prime in manhood where youth ended by his side as in a glistering zodiack hung the sword satan's dire dread and in his hand the spear adam bowed low he kingly from his state inclined not but his coming thus declared adam heaven's high behest no preface needs sufficient that thy prayers are heard and death then due by sentence when thou didst transgress defeated of his seisure many days given thee of grace wherein thou mayest repent and one bad act with many deeds well done mayest cover well may then thy lord appeased redeem thee quite from death's rapacious claim but longer in this paradise to dwell permits not to remove thee i am come and send thee from the garden forth to till the ground whence thou wast taken fitter soil he added not for adam at the news heart-struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood that all his senses bound eve who unseen yet all had heard with audible lament discovered soon the place of her retire o unexpected stroke worse than of death must i thus leave thee paradise thus leave thee native soil these happy walks and shades fit haunt of gods where i had hope to spend quiet though sad the respite of that day that must be mortal to us both o flowers that never will in other climate grow my early visitation and my last t even which i bred up with tender hand from the first opening bud and gave ye names who now shall rear ye to the sun or rank your tribes and water from the ambrosial fount thee lastly nuptial bower by me adorned with what to sight or smell was sweet from thee how shall i part and whither wander down into a lower world to this obscure and wild how shall we breathe in other air less pure accustomed to immortal fruits whom thus the angel interrupted mild lament not eve but patiently resign what justly thou hast lost nor set thy heart thus over-fond on that which is not thine thy going is not lonely with thee goes thy husband whom to follow thou art bound where he abides think there thy native soil adam by this from the cold sudden damp recovering and his scattered spirits returned to michael thus his humble words addressed celestial whether among the thrones or named of them the highest for such of shape may seem prince above princes gently hast thou told thy message which might else in telling wound and in performing end us what besides of sorrow and dejection and despair our frailty can sustain thy tidings bring departure from this happy place our sweet recess and only consolation left familiar to our eyes all places else inhospitable appear and desolate nor knowing us nor known and if by prayer incessant i could hope to change the will of him who all things can i would not cease to weary him with my assiduous cries but prayer against his absolute decree no more avails than breath against the wind blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth therefore to his great bidding i submit this most afflicts me that departing hence as from his face i shall be hid deprived his blessed countenance here i could frequent with worship place by place where he vouchsafed presence divine and to my sons relate 'on this mount he appeared under this tree 'stood visible among these pines his voice 'i heard here with him at this fountain talked so many grateful altars i would rear of grassy turf and pile up every stone of lustre from the brook in memory or monument to ages and theron offer sweet-smelling gums and fruits and flowers in yonder nether world where shall i seek his bright appearances or foot-step trace for though i fled him angry yet recalled to life prolonged and promised race i now gladly behold though but his utmost skirts of glory and far off his steps adore to whom thus michael with regard benign adam thou knowest heaven his and all the earth not this rock only his omnipresence fills land sea and air and every kind that lives fomented by his virtual power and warmed all the earth he gave thee to possess and rule no despicable gift surmise not then his presence to these narrow bounds confined of paradise or eden this had been perhaps thy capital seat from whence had spread all generations and had hither come from all the ends of the earth to celebrate and reverence thee their great progenitor but this pre-eminence thou hast lost brought down to dwell on even ground now with thy sons yet doubt not but in valley and in plain god is as here and will be found alike present and of his presence many a sign still following thee still compassing thee round with goodness and paternal love his face express and of his steps the track divine which that thou mayest believe and be confirmed ere thou from hence depart know i am sent to show thee what shall come in future days to thee and to thy offspring good with bad expect to hear supernal grace contending with sinfulness of men thereby to learn true patience and to temper joy with fear and pious sorrow equally inured by moderation either state to bear prosperous or adverse so shalt thou lead safest thy life and best prepared endure thy mortal passage when it comes -- ascend this hill let eve for i have drenched her eyes here sleep below while thou to foresight wakest as once thou sleptst while she to life was formed to whom thus adam gratefully replied ascend i follow thee safe guide the path thou leadest me and to the hand of heaven submit however chastening to the evil turn my obvious breast arming to overcome by suffering and earn rest from labour won if so i may attain -- so both ascend in the visions of god it was a hill of paradise the highest from whose top the hemisphere of earth in clearest ken stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay not higher that hill nor wider looking round whereon for different cause the tempter set our second adam in the wilderness to show him all earth's kingdoms and their glory his eye might there command wherever stood city of old or modern fame the seat of mightiest empire from the destined walls of cambalu seat of cathaian can and samarchand by oxus temir's throne to paquin of sinaean kings and thence to agra and lahor of great mogul down to the golden chersonese or where the persian in ecbatan sat or since in hispahan or where the russian ksar in mosco or the sultan in bizance turchestan-born nor could his eye not ken the empire of negus to his utmost port ercoco and the less maritim kings mombaza and quiloa and melind and sofala thought ophir to the realm of congo and angola farthest south or thence from niger flood to atlas mount the kingdoms of almansor fez and sus morocco and algiers and tremisen on europe thence and where rome was to sway the world in spirit perhaps he also saw rich mexico the seat of montezume and cusco in peru the richer seat of atabalipa and yet unspoiled guiana whose great city geryon's sons call el dorado but to nobler sights michael from adam's eyes the film removed which that false fruit that promised clearer sight had bred then purged with euphrasy and rue the visual nerve for he had much to see and from the well of life three drops instilled so deep the power of these ingredients pierced even to the inmost seat of mental sight that adam now enforced to close his eyes sunk down and all his spirits became entranced but him the gentle angel by the hand soon raised and his attention thus recalled adam now ope thine eyes and first behold the effects which thy original crime hath wrought in some to spring from thee who never touched the excepted tree nor with the snake conspired nor sinned thy sin yet from that sin derive corruption to bring forth more violent deeds his eyes he opened and beheld a field part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves new reaped the other part sheep-walks and folds i' the midst an altar as the land-mark stood rustick of grassy sord thither anon a sweaty reaper from his tillage brought first fruits the green ear and the yellow sheaf unculled as came to hand a shepherd next more meek came with the firstlings of his flock choicest and best then sacrificing laid the inwards and their fat with incense strowed on the cleft wood and all due rights performed his offering soon propitious fire from heaven consumed with nimble glance and grateful steam the other's not for his was not sincere whereat he inly raged and as they talked smote him into the midriff with a stone that beat out life he fell and deadly pale groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused much at that sight was adam in his heart dismayed and thus in haste to the angel cried o teacher some great mischief hath befallen to that meek man who well had sacrificed is piety thus and pure devotion paid to whom michael thus he also moved replied these two are brethren adam and to come out of thy loins the unjust the just hath slain for envy that his brother's offering found from heaven acceptance but the bloody fact will be avenged and the other's faith approved lose no reward though here thou see him die rolling in dust and gore to which our sire alas both for the deed and for the cause but have i now seen death is this the way i must return to native dust o sight of terrour foul and ugly to behold horrid to think how horrible to feel to whom thus michael death thou hast seen in his first shape on man but many shapes of death and many are the ways that lead to his grim cave all dismal yet to sense more terrible at the entrance than within some as thou sawest by violent stroke shall die by fire flood famine by intemperance more in meats and drinks which on the earth shall bring diseases dire of which a monstrous crew before thee shall appear that thou mayest know what misery the inabstinence of eve shall bring on men immediately a place before his eyes appeared sad noisome dark a lazar-house it seemed wherein were laid numbers of all diseased all maladies of ghastly spasm or racking torture qualms of heart-sick agony all feverous kinds convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs intestine stone and ulcer colick-pangs demoniack phrenzy moaping melancholy and moon-struck madness pining atrophy marasmus and wide-wasting pestilence dropsies and asthmas and joint-racking rheums dire was the tossing deep the groans despair tended the sick busiest from couch to couch and over them triumphant death his dart shook but delayed to strike though oft invoked with vows as their chief good and final hope sight so deform what heart of rock could long dry-eyed behold adam could not but wept though not of woman born compassion quelled his best of man and gave him up to tears a space till firmer thoughts restrained excess and scarce recovering words his plaint renewed o miserable mankind to what fall degraded to what wretched state reserved better end here unborn why is life given to be thus wrested from us rather why obtruded on us thus who if we knew what we receive would either no accept life offered or soon beg to lay it down glad to be so dismissed in peace can thus the image of god in man created once so goodly and erect though faulty since to such unsightly sufferings be debased under inhuman pains why should not man retaining still divine similitude in part from such deformities be free and for his maker's image sake exempt their maker's image answered michael then forsook them when themselves they vilified to serve ungoverned appetite and took his image whom they served a brutish vice inductive mainly to the sin of eve therefore so abject is their punishment disfiguring not god's likeness but their own or if his likeness by themselves defaced while they pervert pure nature's healthful rules to loathsome sickness worthily since they god's image did not reverence in themselves i yield it just said adam and submit but is there yet no other way besides these painful passages how we may come to death and mix with our connatural dust there is said michael if thou well observe the rule of not too much by temperance taught in what thou eatest and drinkest seeking from thence due nourishment not gluttonous delight till many years over thy head return so mayest thou live till like ripe fruit thou drop into thy mother's lap or be with ease gathered nor harshly plucked for death mature this is old age but then thou must outlive thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change to withered weak and gray thy senses then obtuse all taste of pleasure must forego to what thou hast and for the air of youth hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reign a melancholy damp of cold and dry to weigh thy spirits down and last consume the balm of life to whom our ancestor henceforth i fly not death nor would prolong life much bent rather how i may be quit fairest and easiest of this cumbrous charge which i must keep till my appointed day of rendering up and patiently attend my dissolution michael replied nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livest live well how long or short permit to heaven and now prepare thee for another sight he looked and saw a spacious plain whereon were tents of various hue by some were herds of cattle grazing others whence the sound of instruments that made melodious chime was heard of harp and organ and who moved their stops and chords was seen his volant touch instinct through all proportions low and high fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue in other part stood one who at the forge labouring two massy clods of iron and brass had melted whether found where casual fire had wasted woods on mountain or in vale down to the veins of earth thence gliding hot to some cave's mouth or whether washed by stream from underground the liquid ore he drained into fit moulds prepared from which he formed first his own tools then what might else be wrought fusil or graven in metal after these but on the hither side a different sort from the high neighbouring hills which was their seat down to the plain descended by their guise just men they seemed and all their study bent to worship god aright and know his works not hid nor those things last which might preserve freedom and peace to men they on the plain long had not walked when from the tents behold a bevy of fair women richly gay in gems and wanton dress to the harp they sung soft amorous ditties and in dance came on the men though grave eyed them and let their eyes rove without rein till in the amorous net fast caught they liked and each his liking chose and now of love they treat till the evening-star love's harbinger appeared then all in heat they light the nuptial torch and bid invoke hymen then first to marriage rites invoked with feast and musick all the tents resound such happy interview and fair event of love and youth not lost songs garlands flowers and charming symphonies attached the heart of adam soon inclined to admit delight the bent of nature which he thus expressed true opener of mine eyes prime angel blest much better seems this vision and more hope of peaceful days portends than those two past those were of hate and death or pain much worse here nature seems fulfilled in all her ends to whom thus michael judge not what is best by pleasure though to nature seeming meet created as thou art to nobler end holy and pure conformity divine those tents thou sawest so pleasant were the tents of wickedness wherein shall dwell his race who slew his brother studious they appear of arts that polish life inventers rare unmindful of their maker though his spirit taught them but they his gifts acknowledged none yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget for that fair female troop thou sawest that seemed of goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay yet empty of all good wherein consists woman's domestick honour and chief praise bred only and completed to the taste of lustful appetence to sing to dance to dress and troll the tongue and roll the eye to these that sober race of men whose lives religious titled them the sons of god shall yield up all their virtue all their fame ignobly to the trains and to the smiles of these fair atheists and now swim in joy erelong to swim at large and laugh for which the world erelong a world of tears must weep to whom thus adam of short joy bereft o pity and shame that they who to live well entered so fair should turn aside to tread paths indirect or in the mid way faint but still i see the tenour of man's woe holds on the same from woman to begin from man's effeminate slackness it begins said the angel who should better hold his place by wisdom and superiour gifts received but now prepare thee for another scene he looked and saw wide territory spread before him towns and rural works between cities of men with lofty gates and towers concourse in arms fierce faces threatening war giants of mighty bone and bold emprise part wield their arms part curb the foaming steed single or in array of battle ranged both horse and foot nor idly mustering stood one way a band select from forage drives a herd of beeves fair oxen and fair kine from a fat meadow ground or fleecy flock ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain their booty scarce with life the shepherds fly but call in aid which makes a bloody fray with cruel tournament the squadrons join where cattle pastured late now scattered lies with carcasses and arms the ensanguined field deserted others to a city strong lay siege encamped by battery scale and mine assaulting others from the wall defend with dart and javelin stones and sulphurous fire on each hand slaughter and gigantick deeds in other part the sceptered heralds call to council in the city-gates anon gray-headed men and grave with warriours mixed assemble and harangues are heard but soon in factious opposition till at last of middle age one rising eminent in wise deport spake much of right and wrong of justice or religion truth and peace and judgement from above him old and young exploded and had seized with violent hands had not a cloud descending snatched him thence unseen amid the throng so violence proceeded and oppression and sword-law through all the plain and refuge none was found adam was all in tears and to his guide lamenting turned full sad o what are these death's ministers not men who thus deal death inhumanly to men and multiply ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew his brother for of whom such massacre make they but of their brethren men of men but who was that just man whom had not heaven rescued had in his righteousness been lost to whom thus michael these are the product of those ill-mated marriages thou sawest where good with bad were matched who of themselves abhor to join and by imprudence mixed produce prodigious births of body or mind such were these giants men of high renown for in those days might only shall be admired and valour and heroick virtue called to overcome in battle and subdue nations and bring home spoils with infinite man-slaughter shall be held the highest pitch of human glory and for glory done of triumph to be styled great conquerours patrons of mankind gods and sons of gods destroyers rightlier called and plagues of men thus fame shall be achieved renown on earth and what most merits fame in silence hid but he the seventh from thee whom thou beheldst the only righteous in a world preverse and therefore hated therefore so beset with foes for daring single to be just and utter odious truth that god would come to judge them with his saints him the most high rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds did as thou sawest receive to walk with god high in salvation and the climes of bliss exempt from death to show thee what reward awaits the good the rest what punishment which now direct thine eyes and soon behold he looked and saw the face of things quite changed the brazen throat of war had ceased to roar all now was turned to jollity and game to luxury and riot feast and dance marrying or prostituting as befel rape or adultery where passing fair allured them thence from cups to civil broils at length a reverend sire among them came and of their doings great dislike declared and testified against their ways he oft frequented their assemblies whereso met triumphs or festivals and to them preached conversion and repentance as to souls in prison under judgements imminent but all in vain which when he saw he ceased contending and removed his tents far off then from the mountain hewing timber tall began to build a vessel of huge bulk measured by cubit length and breadth and highth smeared round with pitch and in the side a door contrived and of provisions laid in large for man and beast when lo a wonder strange of every beast and bird and insect small came sevens and pairs and entered in as taught their order last the sire and his three sons with their four wives and god made fast the door mean while the south-wind rose and with black wings wide-hovering all the clouds together drove from under heaven the hills to their supply vapour and exhalation dusk and moist sent up amain and now the thickened sky like a dark cieling stood down rushed the rain impetuous and continued till the earth no more was seen the floating vessel swum uplifted and secure with beaked prow rode tilting o'er the waves all dwellings else flood overwhelmed and them with all their pomp deep under water rolled sea covered sea sea without shore and in their palaces where luxury late reigned sea-monsters whelped and stabled of mankind so numerous late all left in one small bottom swum imbarked how didst thou grieve then adam to behold the end of all thy offspring end so sad depopulation thee another flood of tears and sorrow a flood thee also drowned and sunk thee as thy sons till gently reared by the angel on thy feet thou stoodest at last though comfortless as when a father mourns his children all in view destroyed at once and scarce to the angel utter'dst thus thy plaint o visions ill foreseen better had i lived ignorant of future so had borne my part of evil only each day's lot enough to bear those now that were dispensed the burden of many ages on me light at once by my foreknowledge gaining birth abortive to torment me ere their being with thought that they must be let no man seek henceforth to be foretold what shall befall him or his children evil he may be sure which neither his foreknowing can prevent and he the future evil shall no less in apprehension than in substance feel grievous to bear but that care now is past man is not whom to warn those few escaped famine and anguish will at last consume wandering that watery desart i had hope when violence was ceased and war on earth all would have then gone well peace would have crowned with length of happy days the race of man but i was far deceived for now i see peace to corrupt no less than war to waste how comes it thus unfold celestial guide and whether here the race of man will end to whom thus michael those whom last thou sawest in triumph and luxurious wealth are they first seen in acts of prowess eminent and great exploits but of true virtue void who having spilt much blood and done much wast subduing nations and achieved thereby fame in the world high titles and rich prey shall change their course to pleasure ease and sloth surfeit and lust till wantonness and pride raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace the conquered also and enslaved by war shall with their freedom lost all virtue lose and fear of god from whom their piety feigned in sharp contest of battle found no aid against invaders therefore cooled in zeal thenceforth shall practice how to live secure worldly or dissolute on what their lords shall leave them to enjoy for the earth shall bear more than enough that temperance may be tried so all shall turn degenerate all depraved justice and temperance truth and faith forgot one man except the only son of light in a dark age against example good against allurement custom and a world offended fearless of reproach and scorn the grand-child with twelve sons encreased departs from canaan to a land hereafter called egypt divided by the river nile see where it flows disgorging at seven mouths into the sea to sojourn in that land he comes invited by a younger son in time of dearth a son whose worthy deeds raise him to be the second in that realm of pharaoh there he dies and leaves his race growing into a nation and now grown suspected to a sequent king who seeks to stop their overgrowth as inmate guests or violence he of their wicked ways shall them admonish and before them set the paths of righteousness how much more safe and full of peace denouncing wrath to come on their impenitence and shall return of them derided but of god observed the one just man alive by his command shall build a wonderous ark as thou beheldst to save himself and houshold from amidst a world devote to universal wrack no sooner he with them of man and beast select for life shall in the ark be lodged and sheltered round but all the cataracts of heaven set open on the earth shall pour rain day and night all fountains of the deep broke up shall heave the ocean to usurp beyond all bounds till inundation rise above the highest hills then shall this mount of paradise by might of waves be moved out of his place pushed by the horned flood with all his verdure spoiled and trees adrift down the great river to the opening gulf and there take root an island salt and bare the haunt of seals and orcs and sea-mews' clang to teach thee that god attributes to place no sanctity if none be thither brought by men who there frequent or therein dwell and now what further shall ensue behold he looked and saw the ark hull on the flood which now abated for the clouds were fled driven by a keen north-wind that blowing dry wrinkled the face of deluge as decayed and the clear sun on his wide watery glass gazed hot and of the fresh wave largely drew as after thirst which made their flowing shrink from standing lake to tripping ebb that stole with soft foot towards the deep who now had stopt his sluces as the heaven his windows shut the ark no more now floats but seems on ground fast on the top of some high mountain fixed and now the tops of hills as rocks appear with clamour thence the rapid currents drive towards the retreating sea their furious tide forthwith from out the ark a raven flies and after him the surer messenger a dove sent forth once and again to spy green tree or ground whereon his foot may light the second time returning in his bill an olive-leaf he brings pacifick sign anon dry ground appears and from his ark the ancient sire descends with all his train then with uplifted hands and eyes devout grateful to heaven over his head beholds a dewy cloud and in the cloud a bow conspicuous with three lifted colours gay betokening peace from god and covenant new whereat the heart of adam erst so sad greatly rejoiced and thus his joy broke forth o thou who future things canst represent as present heavenly instructer i revive at this last sight assured that man shall live with all the creatures and their seed preserve far less i now lament for one whole world of wicked sons destroyed than i rejoice for one man found so perfect and so just that god vouchsafes to raise another world from him and all his anger to forget but say what mean those coloured streaks in heaven distended as the brow of god appeased or serve they as a flowery verge to bind the fluid skirts of that same watery cloud lest it again dissolve and shower the earth to whom the arch-angel dextrously thou aimest so willingly doth god remit his ire though late repenting him of man depraved grieved at his heart when looking down he saw the whole earth filled with violence and all flesh corrupting each their way yet those removed such grace shall one just man find in his sight that he relents not to blot out mankind and makes a covenant never to destroy the earth again by flood nor let the sea surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world with man therein or beast but when he brings over the earth a cloud will therein set his triple-coloured bow whereon to look and call to mind his covenant day and night seed-time and harvest heat and hoary frost shall hold their course till fire purge all things new both heaven and earth wherein the just shall dwell book xii as one who in his journey bates at noon though bent on speed so here the arch-angel paused betwixt the world destroyed and world restored if adam aught perhaps might interpose then with transition sweet new speech resumes thus thou hast seen one world begin and end and man as from a second stock proceed much thou hast yet to see but i perceive thy mortal sight to fail objects divine must needs impair and weary human sense henceforth what is to come i will relate thou therefore give due audience and attend this second source of men while yet but few and while the dread of judgement past remains fresh in their minds fearing the deity with some regard to what is just and right shall lead their lives and multiply apace labouring the soil and reaping plenteous crop corn wine and oil and from the herd or flock oft sacrificing bullock lamb or kid with large wine-offerings poured and sacred feast shall spend their days in joy unblamed and dwell long time in peace by families and tribes under paternal rule till one shall rise of proud ambitious heart who not content with fair equality fraternal state will arrogate dominion undeserved over his brethren and quite dispossess concord and law of nature from the earth hunting and men not beasts shall be his game with war and hostile snare such as refuse subjection to his empire tyrannous a mighty hunter thence he shall be styled before the lord as in despite of heaven or from heaven claiming second sovranty and from rebellion shall derive his name though of rebellion others he accuse he with a crew whom like ambition joins with him or under him to tyrannize marching from eden towards the west shall find the plain wherein a black bituminous gurge boils out from under ground the mouth of hell of brick and of that stuff they cast to build a city and tower whose top may reach to heaven and get themselves a name lest far dispersed in foreign lands their memory be lost regardless whether good or evil fame but god who oft descends to visit men unseen and through their habitations walks to mark their doings them beholding soon comes down to see their city ere the tower obstruct heaven-towers and in derision sets upon their tongues a various spirit to rase quite out their native language and instead to sow a jangling noise of words unknown forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud among the builders each to other calls not understood till hoarse and all in rage as mocked they storm great laughter was in heaven and looking down to see the hubbub strange and hear the din thus was the building left ridiculous and the work confusion named whereto thus adam fatherly displeased o execrable son so to aspire above his brethren to himself assuming authority usurped from god not given he gave us only over beast fish fowl dominion absolute that right we hold by his donation but man over men he made not lord such title to himself reserving human left from human free but this usurper his encroachment proud stays not on man to god his tower intends siege and defiance wretched man what food will he convey up thither to sustain himself and his rash army where thin air above the clouds will pine his entrails gross and famish him of breath if not of bread to whom thus michael justly thou abhorrest that son who on the quiet state of men such trouble brought affecting to subdue rational liberty yet know withal since thy original lapse true liberty is lost which always with right reason dwells twinned and from her hath no dividual being reason in man obscured or not obeyed immediately inordinate desires and upstart passions catch the government from reason and to servitude reduce man till then free therefore since he permits within himself unworthy powers to reign over free reason god in judgement just subjects him from without to violent lords who oft as undeservedly enthrall his outward freedom tyranny must be though to the tyrant thereby no excuse yet sometimes nations will decline so low from virtue which is reason that no wrong but justice and some fatal curse annexed deprives them of their outward liberty their inward lost witness the irreverent son of him who built the ark who for the shame done to his father heard this heavy curse servant of servants on his vicious race thus will this latter as the former world still tend from bad to worse till god at last wearied with their iniquities withdraw his presence from among them and avert his holy eyes resolving from thenceforth to leave them to their own polluted ways and one peculiar nation to select from all the rest of whom to be invoked a nation from one faithful man to spring him on this side euphrates yet residing bred up in idol-worship o that men canst thou believe should be so stupid grown while yet the patriarch lived who 'scaped the flood as to forsake the living god and fall to worship their own work in wood and stone for gods yet him god the most high vouchsafes to call by vision from his father's house his kindred and false gods into a land which he will show him and from him will raise a mighty nation and upon him shower his benediction so that in his seed all nations shall be blest he straight obeys not knowing to what land yet firm believes i see him but thou canst not with what faith he leaves his gods his friends and native soil ur of chaldaea passing now the ford to haran after him a cumbrous train of herds and flocks and numerous servitude not wandering poor but trusting all his wealth with god who called him in a land unknown canaan he now attains i see his tents pitched about sechem and the neighbouring plain of moreh there by promise he receives gift to his progeny of all that land from hameth northward to the desart south things by their names i call though yet unnamed from hermon east to the great western sea mount hermon yonder sea each place behold in prospect as i point them on the shore mount carmel here the double-founted stream jordan true limit eastward but his sons shall dwell to senir that long ridge of hills this ponder that all nations of the earth shall in his seed be blessed by that seed is meant thy great deliverer who shall bruise the serpent's head whereof to thee anon plainlier shall be revealed this patriarch blest whom faithful abraham due time shall call a son and of his son a grand-child leaves like him in faith in wisdom and renown the grandchild with twelve sons increased departs from canaan to a land hereafter called egypt divided by the river nile see where it flows disgorging at seven mouths into the sea to sojourn in that land he comes invited by a younger son in time of dearth a son whose worthy deeds raise him to be the second in that realm of pharaoh there he dies and leaves his race growing into a nation and now grown suspected to a sequent king who seeks to stop their overgrowth as inmate guests too numerous whence of guests he makes them slaves inhospitably and kills their infant males till by two brethren these two brethren call moses and aaron sent from god to claim his people from enthralment they return with glory and spoil back to their promised land but first the lawless tyrant who denies to know their god or message to regard must be compelled by signs and judgements dire to blood unshed the rivers must be turned frogs lice and flies must all his palace fill with loathed intrusion and fill all the land his cattle must of rot and murren die botches and blains must all his flesh emboss and all his people thunder mixed with hail hail mixed with fire must rend the egyptians sky and wheel on the earth devouring where it rolls what it devours not herb or fruit or grain a darksome cloud of locusts swarming down must eat and on the ground leave nothing green darkness must overshadow all his bounds palpable darkness and blot out three days last with one midnight stroke all the first-born of egypt must lie dead thus with ten wounds the river-dragon tamed at length submits to let his sojourners depart and oft humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice more hardened after thaw till in his rage pursuing whom he late dismissed the sea swallows him with his host but them lets pass as on dry land between two crystal walls awed by the rod of moses so to stand divided till his rescued gain their shore such wondrous power god to his saint will lend though present in his angel who shall go before them in a cloud and pillar of fire by day a cloud by night a pillar of fire to guide them in their journey and remove behind them while the obdurate king pursues all night he will pursue but his approach darkness defends between till morning watch then through the fiery pillar and the cloud god looking forth will trouble all his host and craze their chariot-wheels when by command moses once more his potent rod extends over the sea the sea his rod obeys on their embattled ranks the waves return and overwhelm their war the race elect safe toward canaan from the shore advance through the wild desart not the readiest way lest entering on the canaanite alarmed war terrify them inexpert and fear return them back to egypt choosing rather inglorious life with servitude for life to noble and ignoble is more sweet untrained in arms where rashness leads not on this also shall they gain by their delay in the wide wilderness there they shall found their government and their great senate choose through the twelve tribes to rule by laws ordained god from the mount of sinai whose gray top shall tremble he descending will himself in thunder lightning and loud trumpets' sound ordain them laws part such as appertain to civil justice part religious rites of sacrifice informing them by types and shadows of that destined seed to bruise the serpent by what means he shall achieve mankind's deliverance but the voice of god to mortal ear is dreadful they beseech that moses might report to them his will and terrour cease he grants what they besought instructed that to god is no access without mediator whose high office now moses in figure bears to introduce one greater of whose day he shall foretel and all the prophets in their age the times of great messiah shall sing thus laws and rites established such delight hath god in men obedient to his will that he vouchsafes among them to set up his tabernacle the holy one with mortal men to dwell by his prescript a sanctuary is framed of cedar overlaid with gold therein an ark and in the ark his testimony the records of his covenant over these a mercy-seat of gold between the wings of two bright cherubim before him burn seven lamps as in a zodiack representing the heavenly fires over the tent a cloud shall rest by day a fiery gleam by night save when they journey and at length they come conducted by his angel to the land promised to abraham and his seed -- the rest were long to tell how many battles fought how many kings destroyed and kingdoms won or how the sun shall in mid heaven stand still a day entire and night's due course adjourn man's voice commanding 'sun in gibeon stand 'and thou moon in the vale of aialon 'till israel overcome so call the third from abraham son of isaac and from him his whole descent who thus shall canaan win here adam interposed o sent from heaven enlightener of my darkness gracious things thou hast revealed those chiefly which concern just abraham and his seed now first i find mine eyes true-opening and my heart much eased erewhile perplexed with thoughts what would become of me and all mankind but now i see his day in whom all nations shall be blest favour unmerited by me who sought forbidden knowledge by forbidden means this yet i apprehend not why to those among whom god will deign to dwell on earth so many and so various laws are given so many laws argue so many sins among them how can god with such reside to whom thus michael doubt not but that sin will reign among them as of thee begot and therefore was law given them to evince their natural pravity by stirring up sin against law to fight that when they see law can discover sin but not remove save by those shadowy expiations weak the blood of bulls and goats they may conclude some blood more precious must be paid for man just for unjust that in such righteousness to them by faith imputed they may find justification towards god and peace of conscience which the law by ceremonies cannot appease nor man the mortal part perform and not performing cannot live so law appears imperfect and but given with purpose to resign them in full time up to a better covenant disciplined from shadowy types to truth from flesh to spirit from imposition of strict laws to free acceptance of large grace from servile fear to filial works of law to works of faith and therefore shall not moses though of god highly beloved being but the minister of law his people into canaan lead but joshua whom the gentiles jesus call his name and office bearing who shall quell the adversary-serpent and bring back through the world's wilderness long-wandered man safe to eternal paradise of rest mean while they in their earthly canaan placed long time shall dwell and prosper but when sins national interrupt their publick peace provoking god to raise them enemies from whom as oft he saves them penitent by judges first then under kings of whom the second both for piety renowned and puissant deeds a promise shall receive irrevocable that his regal throne for ever shall endure the like shall sing all prophecy that of the royal stock of david so i name this king shall rise a son the woman's seed to thee foretold foretold to abraham as in whom shall trust all nations and to kings foretold of kings the last for of his reign shall be no end but first a long succession must ensue and his next son for wealth and wisdom famed the clouded ark of god till then in tents wandering shall in a glorious temple enshrine such follow him as shall be registered part good part bad of bad the longer scroll whose foul idolatries and other faults heaped to the popular sum will so incense god as to leave them and expose their land their city his temple and his holy ark with all his sacred things a scorn and prey to that proud city whose high walls thou sawest left in confusion babylon thence called there in captivity he lets them dwell the space of seventy years then brings them back remembering mercy and his covenant sworn to david stablished as the days of heaven returned from babylon by leave of kings their lords whom god disposed the house of god they first re-edify and for a while in mean estate live moderate till grown in wealth and multitude factious they grow but first among the priests dissention springs men who attend the altar and should most endeavour peace their strife pollution brings upon the temple itself at last they seise the scepter and regard not david's sons then lose it to a stranger that the true anointed king messiah might be born barred of his right yet at his birth a star unseen before in heaven proclaims him come and guides the eastern sages who inquire his place to offer incense myrrh and gold his place of birth a solemn angel tells to simple shepherds keeping watch by night they gladly thither haste and by a quire of squadroned angels hear his carol sung a virgin is his mother but his sire the power of the most high he shall ascend the throne hereditary and bound his reign with earth's wide bounds his glory with the heavens he ceased discerning adam with such joy surcharged as had like grief been dewed in tears without the vent of words which these he breathed o prophet of glad tidings finisher of utmost hope now clear i understand what oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain why our great expectation should be called the seed of woman virgin mother hail high in the love of heaven yet from my loins thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the son of god most high so god with man unites needs must the serpent now his capital bruise expect with mortal pain say where and when their fight what stroke shall bruise the victor's heel to whom thus michael dream not of their fight as of a duel or the local wounds of head or heel not therefore joins the son manhood to godhead with more strength to foil thy enemy nor so is overcome satan whose fall from heaven a deadlier bruise disabled not to give thee thy death's wound which he who comes thy saviour shall recure not by destroying satan but his works in thee and in thy seed nor can this be but by fulfilling that which thou didst want obedience to the law of god imposed on penalty of death and suffering death the penalty to thy transgression due and due to theirs which out of thine will grow so only can high justice rest appaid the law of god exact he shall fulfil both by obedience and by love though love alone fulfil the law thy punishment he shall endure by coming in the flesh to a reproachful life and cursed death proclaiming life to all who shall believe in his redemption and that his obedience imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits to save them not their own though legal works for this he shall live hated be blasphemed seised on by force judged and to death condemned a shameful and accursed nailed to the cross by his own nation slain for bringing life but to the cross he nails thy enemies the law that is against thee and the sins of all mankind with him there crucified never to hurt them more who rightly trust in this his satisfaction so he dies but soon revives death over him no power shall long usurp ere the third dawning light return the stars of morn shall see him rise out of his grave fresh as the dawning light thy ransom paid which man from death redeems his death for man as many as offered life neglect not and the benefit embrace by faith not void of works this god-like act annuls thy doom the death thou shouldest have died in sin for ever lost from life this act shall bruise the head of satan crush his strength defeating sin and death his two main arms and fix far deeper in his head their stings than temporal death shall bruise the victor's heel or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep a gentle wafting to immortal life nor after resurrection shall he stay longer on earth than certain times to appear to his disciples men who in his life still followed him to them shall leave in charge to teach all nations what of him they learned and his salvation them who shall believe baptizing in the profluent stream the sign of washing them from guilt of sin to life pure and in mind prepared if so befall for death like that which the redeemer died all nations they shall teach for from that day not only to the sons of abraham's loins salvation shall be preached but to the sons of abraham's faith wherever through the world so in his seed all nations shall be blest then to the heaven of heavens he shall ascend with victory triumphing through the air over his foes and thine there shall surprise the serpent prince of air and drag in chains through all his realm and there confounded leave then enter into glory and resume his seat at god's right hand exalted high above all names in heaven and thence shall come when this world's dissolution shall be ripe with glory and power to judge both quick and dead to judge the unfaithful dead but to reward his faithful and receive them into bliss whether in heaven or earth for then the earth shall all be paradise far happier place than this of eden and far happier days so spake the arch-angel michael then paused as at the world's great period and our sire replete with joy and wonder thus replied o goodness infinite goodness immense that all this good of evil shall produce and evil turn to good more wonderful than that which by creation first brought forth light out of darkness full of doubt i stand whether i should repent me now of sin by me done and occasioned or rejoice much more that much more good thereof shall spring to god more glory more good-will to men from god and over wrath grace shall abound but say if our deliverer up to heaven must re-ascend what will betide the few his faithful left among the unfaithful herd the enemies of truth who then shall guide his people who defend will they not deal worse with his followers than with him they dealt be sure they will said the angel but from heaven he to his own a comforter will send the promise of the father who shall dwell his spirit within them and the law of faith working through love upon their hearts shall write to guide them in all truth and also arm with spiritual armour able to resist satan's assaults and quench his fiery darts what man can do against them not afraid though to the death against such cruelties with inward consolations recompensed and oft supported so as shall amaze their proudest persecutors for the spirit poured first on his apostles whom he sends to evangelize the nations then on all baptized shall them with wonderous gifts endue to speak all tongues and do all miracles as did their lord before them thus they win great numbers of each nation to receive with joy the tidings brought from heaven at length their ministry performed and race well run their doctrine and their story written left they die but in their room as they forewarn wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves who all the sacred mysteries of heaven to their own vile advantages shall turn of lucre and ambition and the truth with superstitions and traditions taint left only in those written records pure though not but by the spirit understood then shall they seek to avail themselves of names places and titles and with these to join secular power though feigning still to act by spiritual to themselves appropriating the spirit of god promised alike and given to all believers and from that pretence spiritual laws by carnal power shall force on every conscience laws which none shall find left them inrolled or what the spirit within shall on the heart engrave what will they then but force the spirit of grace itself and bind his consort liberty what but unbuild his living temples built by faith to stand their own faith not another's for on earth who against faith and conscience can be heard infallible yet many will presume whence heavy persecution shall arise on all who in the worship persevere of spirit and truth the rest far greater part will deem in outward rites and specious forms religion satisfied truth shall retire bestuck with slanderous darts and works of faith rarely be found so shall the world go on to good malignant to bad men benign under her own weight groaning till the day appear of respiration to the just and vengeance to the wicked at return of him so lately promised to thy aid the woman's seed obscurely then foretold now ampler known thy saviour and thy lord last in the clouds from heaven to be revealed in glory of the father to dissolve satan with his perverted world then raise from the conflagrant mass purged and refined new heavens new earth ages of endless date founded in righteousness and peace and love to bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss he ended and thus adam last replied how soon hath thy prediction seer blest measured this transient world the race of time till time stand fixed beyond is all abyss eternity whose end no eye can reach greatly-instructed i shall hence depart greatly in peace of thought and have my fill of knowledge what this vessel can contain beyond which was my folly to aspire henceforth i learn that to obey is best and love with fear the only god to walk as in his presence ever to observe his providence and on him sole depend merciful over all his works with good still overcoming evil and by small accomplishing great things by things deemed weak subverting worldly strong and worldly wise by simply meek that suffering for truth's sake is fortitude to highest victory and to the faithful death the gate of life taught this by his example whom i now acknowledge my redeemer ever blest to whom thus also the angel last replied this having learned thou hast attained the sum of wisdom hope no higher though all the stars thou knewest by name and all the ethereal powers all secrets of the deep all nature's works or works of god in heaven air earth or sea and all the riches of this world enjoyedst and all the rule one empire only add deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith add virtue patience temperance add love by name to come called charity the soul of all the rest then wilt thou not be loth to leave this paradise but shalt possess a paradise within thee happier far -- let us descend now therefore from this top of speculation for the hour precise exacts our parting hence and see the guards by me encamped on yonder hill expect their motion at whose front a flaming sword in signal of remove waves fiercely round we may no longer stay go waken eve her also i with gentle dreams have calmed portending good and all her spirits composed to meek submission thou at season fit let her with thee partake what thou hast heard chiefly what may concern her faith to know the great deliverance by her seed to come for by the woman's seed on all mankind that ye may live which will be many days both in one faith unanimous though sad with cause for evils past yet much more cheered with meditation on the happy end he ended and they both descend the hill descended adam to the bower where eve lay sleeping ran before but found her waked and thus with words not sad she him received whence thou returnest and whither wentest i know for god is also in sleep and dreams advise which he hath sent propitious some great good presaging since with sorrow and heart's distress wearied i fell asleep but now lead on in me is no delay with thee to go is to stay here without thee here to stay is to go hence unwilling thou to me art all things under heaven all places thou who for my wilful crime art banished hence this further consolation yet secure i carry hence though all by me is lost such favour i unworthy am vouchsafed by me the promised seed shall all restore so spake our mother eve and adam heard well pleased but answered not for now too nigh the arch-angel stood and from the other hill to their fixed station all in bright array the cherubim descended on the ground gliding meteorous as evening-mist risen from a river o'er the marish glides and gathers ground fast at the labourer's heel homeward returning high in front advanced the brandished sword of god before them blazed fierce as a comet which with torrid heat and vapour as the libyan air adust began to parch that temperate clime whereat in either hand the hastening angel caught our lingering parents and to the eastern gate led them direct and down the cliff as fast to the subjected plain then disappeared they looking back all the eastern side beheld of paradise so late their happy seat waved over by that flaming brand the gate with dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms some natural tears they dropt but wiped them soon the world was all before them where to choose their place of rest and providence their guide they hand in hand with wandering steps and
